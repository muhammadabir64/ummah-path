<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>The Surah takes its name from verse 224 in which 
the word Ash-Shu`araa' occurs.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br>
<br>The subject matter and the style show, and the traditions confirm, that it 
was revealed during the middle Makkan period. According to Ibn Abbas, Surah Ta 
Ha was revealed first, then Surah Al Waqiah, and then Surah Ash-Shu'araa.(Ruh-ul-Ma'ani, 
Vol. xx, p. 64). About Surah Ta Ha it is well known that it had been revealed 
before Hadrat Umar embraced Islam.<br><br><strong>Subject Matter and Topics</strong><br>
<br>The background of the Surah is that the disbelievers of Makkah were 
persistently refusing, on one pretext or the other, to accept the message of 
Islam given by the Holy Prophet. Sometimes they would say that he did not show 
them any sign to convince them of his Prophethood; sometimes they would brand 
him as a poet or a sorcerer and mock his message; and sometimes they would 
ridicule his Mission, saying that his followers were either a few foolish youth, 
or the poor people and slaves - whereas, they argued, if his Mission had really 
some value for the people, the nobles and the elders would have accepted it 
first. Thus, while on the one hand, the Holy Prophet was becoming wearied by his 
efforts to show them rationally the errors of their creeds and prove the truth 
of the Doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter, the disbelievers, on the other, 
were never tired of adopting one kind of obduracy after the other. This state of 
affairs was causing great anguish and grief to the Holy Prophet.<br><br>Such 
were the conditions when this Surah was revealed. It begins with words of 
consolation to the Holy Prophet, implying, "Why do you fret for their sake?If 
these people have not believed in you, it is not because they have not seen any 
Sign, but because they are obdurate. They will not listen to reason they want to 
see a Sign which makes them bow their heads in humility. When this Sign is shown 
in due course of time, they will themselves realize that what was being 
presented to them was the Truth."<br><br>After this introduction, till verse 
191, one and the same theme has been presented continuously, and it is said: 
"The whole earth abounds in such Signs as can guide a seeker after truth to 
Reality, but the stubborn and misguided people have never believed even after 
seeing the Signs, whether these were the Signs of the natural phenomena or the 
miracles of the Prophets. These wretched people have stubbornly adhered to their 
erroneous creeds till the Divine scourge actually overtook them." It is to 
illustrate this that the history of seven of the ancient tribes has been told, 
who persisted in disbelief just like the disbelievers of Makkah. In this 
connection, the following points have been stressed:<br><br>The Signs are of two 
kinds:(a) Those which are scattered all over the earth, and by seeing which an 
intelligent person can judge for himself whether what the Prophet is presenting 
is the Truth or not and (b) those which were seen by Pharaoh and his people, 
Noah's people, the Ad and the Thamud, Lot's people and the people of Aiykah. Now 
it is for the disbelievers to decide which kind of the Signs they are eager to 
see.<br><br>The mentality of the disbeliever has been the same throughout the 
ages; their arguments and their objections, and their excuses and subterfuges 
for not believing have been similar and ultimately the fates that they met have 
also been the same. Likewise, the Prophets in every age presented the same 
teachings, their personal character and their reasoning and arguments against 
their opponents were the same, and they were all similarly blessed with mercy by 
Allah Almighty. Both these patterns of behavior and conduct are found in 
history, and the disbelievers could themselves see as to which respective 
patterns they and the Holy Prophet belonged.<br><br>Allah is All Mighty, All 
Powerful and All Merciful at the same time. History contains instances of His 
Wrath as well as of His Mercy. Now, therefore, it is for the people to decide 
whether they would like to deserve Allah's Mercy or His Wrath.<br><br>Lastly, 
the discussion has been summed up, saying "O disbelievers, if at all you want to 
see the Signs, why should you insist on seeing those horrible Signs that visited 
the doomed communities of the past? Why don't you see the Qur'an which is being 
presented in your own language? Why don't you see Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's 
peace and mercy) and his Companions? Can the revelations of the Qur'an be the 
work of a satan or a jinn? Does the recipient of the Qur'an appear to be a 
sorcerer? Are Muhammad and his Companions no different from a poet and his 
admirers? Why don't you give up disbelief and search your hearts for their 
judgment? When in the heart of your hearts you yourselves believe that the 
Revelations of the Qur'an have nothing in common with sorcery and poetry, then 
you should know that you are being cruel and unjust, and will certainly meet the 
doom meant for the cruel and unjust."<br></p>
<hr>
<p>1That is, the verses being presented in this Surah are of that Book, which 
presents and explains its subject-matter clearly and plainly so that every 
reader and listener may easily understand what it invites to, what it enjoins 
and what it forbids, and what it regards as true and what as false. To believe 
or not to believe is a different matter; but no one can have the excuse that he 
could not understand the teachings of the Book and its injunctions and 
prohibitions.<br><br>"Al-Kitab-ul-Mubin" also has the meaning that the Qur'an 
is, beyond any doubt, a Divine Book. Its language, its diction and themes, the 
facts presented by it and the background of its revelations, all testify to the 
fact that this is indeed the Book of the Master of all Creation. In this sense, 
its every sentence is a Sign and a miracle. As such, any person who has common 
sense has no need of any other Sign than the verses of this Book for believing 
in the Prophethood of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings).<br>
<br>Thisbrief introductory sentence, which covers both these meanings, has a 
close connection with the subject-matter of this Surah. The disbelievers of 
Makkah demanded a miracle from the Holy Prophet so as to be convinced that the 
message he gave was really from Allah. In answer to that, it has been said that 
if some one really wanted a Sign for believing in the Prophet, he should study 
the verses of this Book. Then, the disbelievers accused the Holy Prophet of 
being a sorcerer. This charge has been refuted by saying that the Qur'an has 
nothing ambiguous or mysterious in it; but it plainly puts forward all its 
teachings which cannot be the creation of a poet or a sorcerer's imagination.<br>
<br>2The words bakhi'un-nafsaka literally mean: "You would kill yourself." The 
verse in fact describes the extreme anguish, anxiety and grief of the Holy 
Prophet over the Makkan disbelievers' ways of deviation, moral degradation, and 
obduracy and opposition to his message of reform. Sometimes it seemed as if his 
grief and mental suffering for their sake would cause his death. This state of 
the Holy Prophet has been referred to at other places in the Qur'an as well, for 
instance in AI-Kahf: 6, thus: "Well, O Muhammad, it may be that you will consume 
your life for their sake out of sorrow if they do not believe in this message. 
And in Al-Fatir: 8, thus:" ....let not your life be consumed in grief for their 
sake."<br><br>3That is, "It is not at all difficult for Allah to send down a 
Sign which would make all the disbelievers yield and submit. If, however, He 
does not send one, it does not mean that such a thing is beyond His powers, but 
the reason is that . belief under compulsion is not acceptable to Him. Allah 
wants that people should use their common-sense and recognize the Truth through 
the verses of the Divine Book and the Signs which are scattered all over the 
universe and are found even in their own selves. Then, when their hearts are 
satisfied that the message of the Prophets contains the Truth, and the beliefs 
and the creeds which are opposed to it, are false, they should willingly give up 
falsehood and adopt the Truth. This voluntary belief, acceptance of the Truth 
and rejection of falsehood, is what Allah demands from man. It is for this 
reason that Allah has bestowed upon man choice and free will, and freedom to 
follow any way, right or wrong, that he pleases. For the same reason He has 
placed in his nature both the tendencies, towards good and towards evil, and 
opened up before him both the ways, to piety and to sin. For the same purpose He 
has given Satan the freedom and respite to mislead him and has made arrangements 
of Prophethood, Revelation and invitation to goodness to guide him to the right 
way, and has placed man on trial to see whether he adopts the way of belief and 
obedience or of disbelief and sin. On the other hand, if Allah had adopted a 
method of coercing people to believe and obey, it would have defeated the very 
purpose of the trial and test. Then there was no need to send down the Signs for 
the purpose, but He would have created man with a pure nature, without any 
inclination for evil, disbelief and sin, and made him obedient by birth like the 
angels. This has been referred at several places in the Qur'an, for instance in 
Yunus: 99: ` Had your Lord willed all the dwellers of the earth would have 
believed in Him;" and in Hud: 118: '"Your Lord could have made mankind one 
community had He so willed, but now they will continue to follow different ways, 
but only those on whom Allah has His mercy (escape wrong ways). It will be so 
because He has created them for this (very freedom of choice and action)." For 
further explanation, see E.N.'s 101,102 of Yunus and E.N. 116 of Hud. <br><br>
4That is, the people who show lack of feeling and interest for every rational 
attempt made to bring them to the right way, cannot be made to believe forcibly 
by sending down Signs from heaven. They only deserve to be shown their evil end 
after they have been duly warned and shown guidance, which they not Only treated 
with indifference but rejected scornfully. This evil end can be shown to them in 
several ways:<br><br>(1) The Truth which they have bitterly opposed and scoffed 
at should prevail in the world in front of their very eyes in spite of their 
antagonism. (2) They should be visited by a painful torment and eliminated from 
the world. (3) Alter a few years of misguided life they should meet death and 
see for themselves that what they had been following wholeheartedly throughout 
their lives was nothing but falsehood and what the Prophets had been presenting 
was the very Truth, which they had been scoffing at. Thus the evil end can take 
place differently for different people as it happened in the past.<br><br>5That 
is, the seeker after truth does not have to look far for a Sign. If only he sees 
with open eyes the phenomena of vegetation around him, he will be able to judge 
for himself whether the reality about the system of the world (i.e., Tauhid) 
which was being presented by the Prophets is true, or the speculations of the 
polytheists and atheists. From the variety and abundance of creation found on 
the earth, the various elements and factors supporting it, the laws of nature 
causing it to grow and flourish, and the accord and harmony existing between its 
characteristics and the countless needs and demands of innumerable creatures, 
only a fool will conclude that all this is happening automatically without the 
wisdom, knowledge, power and design of an All-Mighty, All-Powerful Creator. 
Obviously, many masters and gods could not have by any device arranged and 
produced the perfect harmony and accord between the soil, the sun and the moon, 
and the animal and plant life produced with their help and the needs of a great 
variety of creatures living on the earth. A sensible person, unless he is 
prejudiced and biased, cannot help feeling convinced that these are the clear 
signs and proofs of the existence of One God, and there is no further need of a 
miracle to convince him of the reality of Tauhid.<br><br>6That is, "He has the 
power and ability to annihilate completely anyone whom He wills to punish, but 
it is His mercy that He dces not hasten to punish the wrung-doer, but gives him 
respite for years and centuries to allow him time to think, understand and mend 
his ways, and is ever ready to forgive the sins of a lifetime if the sinner 
offers repentance but once.<br><br>7After a brief introduction, historical 
events have been presented beginning with the story of Prophet Moses and 
Pharaoh, and attention has been drawn specifically to the following points:<br>
<br>(1) The conditions under which Prophet Moses had to work were much harsher 
and more severe than those faced by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be 
upon him). Prophet Moses belonged to a slave community very much suppressed by 
Pharaoh and his people. In contrast to them, the Holy Prophet was a member of 
the clan of Quraish and his family enjoyed an equal status with the other clans. 
Then Prophet Muses had been bred and brought up in the house of Pharaoh and 
after remaining a fugitive for ten years due to a charge of murder, he was 
commanded to go before the same king from whom he had fled for life. The Holy 
Prophet did not have to face any such situation. Then the empire of Pharaoh was 
the most extensive and powerful empire of the time and the meagre power of the 
Quraish had no comparison with it. In spite of that Pharaoh could not do any 
harm to Prophet Moses and ultimately perished in the conflict. From this Allaln 
wanted the Quraish to learn this lesson: "None can defeat the one who has Allah 
to help him? When Pharaoh with all his might became helpless against Moses, how 
can you, O poor Quraish, succeed against Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace 
and blessings)'?<br><br>(2) There could not be clearer and more manifest Signs 
(miracles) than those which were shown to Pharaoh through Moses. Then in an open 
contest with the magicians before a gathering of hundreds of thousands of people 
to meet the challenge of Pharaoh himself, it had been conclusively demonstrated 
that what was presented by Moses, was not magic. The skillful magicians who were 
themselves Egyptians and had been summoned by Pharaoh himself bore witness to 
the fact that turning of Moses' staff into a serpent was a real change of 
nature, which could only happen through a Divine miracle, and not by any trick 
of magic. Then the magicians' believing in Moses immediately, even at the risk 
of life, proved beyond any doubt that the Sign presented by Moses was a miracle 
and not magic. Yet the disbelievers were not inclined to believe in the Prophet. 
Now how can you, O Quraish, say that you will believe only when you are shown a 
perceptible miracle and a physical Sign '? As a matter of fact, if a person is 
free from prejudice, false sense of prestige and vested interest, and has an 
open mind to appreciate the distinction between truth and falsehood, and is 
prepared to give up falsehood for the truth, he does not stand in need of any 
other signs than those found in this Book, in the life of the one presenting it 
and in the vast universe around him. On the contrary, an obstinate person, who 
is not interested in the truth, and who because of selfish motives is determined 
not to recognize and accept any such truth as may clash with his interests, will 
not be prepared to believe after seeing any sign whatever, even if the earth and 
the heaven are turned upside down in front of his eyes .<br><br>(3) 'the tragic 
end of such obstinacy as met by Pharaoh is not something for which other people 
should become so impatient. Those who do not believe even after seeing with 
their own eyes the Signs of Divine power have inevitably to meet a similar fate. 
Therefore, instead of learning a lesson why do you insist on seeing such a 
dreadful sign? For comparison, see AIA'raf: 103-137, Y'unus: 75-92, Bani Isra'il: 
101-104, and Ta Ha: 9-79. <br><br>8The epithet of "the wicked people" describes 
the extremely wicked character of the people of Pharaoh. <br><br>9That is, "O 
Moses! Just see how these people are perpetrating crime and injustice presuming 
that they are all-powerful in the land having no fear of God, Who will call them 
to account in the Hereafter". <br><br>10The sentence, "My breast straitens", 
shows that Prophet Moses was somewhat hesitant of going alone on such a 
difficult mission, and also had the feeling that he was not eloquent in speech. 
That is why he begged Allah to appoint Aaron too, as messenger to assist him 
who, being more vigorous in speech, could support and strengthen him as and when 
the need arose. It is just possible :hat in the beginning, the Prophet Moses 
might have begged that Aaron be appointed to Prophet hood instead of him, but 
later when he felt that Allah willed him to be appointed to that position, he 
might have appealed that Aaron should at least be made his counselor and 
assistant. We say this because here Prophet Moses is not praying for Aaron to be 
made his counselor, but says, "Appoint Aaron to Prophet hood." On the other 
hand, in Surah Ta Ha, he says, "Appoint for me a counselor from my family-(let 
it be) my brother Aaron." Then in Surah Al Qasas, he says, "My brother Aaron is 
more vigorous in speech than myself, so send him as an assistant with me to 
confirm (and support) me." From this it appears that these two requests were 
made later, but originally Prophet Moses had begged Allah to appoint Aaron to 
Prophet hood instead of himself.<br><br>The Bible has a different story to tell. 
According to it, Prophet Moses, fearing that he would be rejected by the people 
of Pharaoh, and putting forward the excuse of his faltering speech, had declined 
to accept his appointment to prophet hood on the pretext that he lacked vigor 
and eloquence in speech : "O my, Lord, send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him 
whom thou wilt send." (Exodus, 4: 13), Then Allah, of His own will, appointed 
Aaron to be his assistant and persuaded them: to go together before Pharaoh. 
(Exodus, 4: 1-13). For further details, see E.N. 19 of Ta Ha.<br><br>11The 
allusion is to the incident of Prophet Moses giving a blow to an Egyptian, who 
was fighting with an Israelite, and thus causing his death. Then as soon as 
Moses came to know that the report had reached Pharaoh and his people and they 
were planning to take revenge, he fled the country and took refuge in Midian. 
(See Al-Qasas: 15-21) Now when after a period of almost ten years of hiding he 
was suddenly called upon and commanded to go before Pharaoh, who had already a 
charge of murder against him, with the message, Prophet Moses rightly felt 
apprehensive that he would immediately be involved in the murder case even 
before he was able to convey the message as commanded by Allah.<br><br>12Here by 
"Signs" are meant the miracles of the staff and the shining hand, which were 
liven to Moses. For details see Al-A`raf: 106-117, Ta Ha: .1723, An-Naml: 7-14, 
and Al-Qasas: 31-32).<br><br>13The Mission of the Prophets Moses and Aaron was 
twofold: First, to invite Pharaoh to the worship and obedience of Allah which 
has been the foremost aim of the Mission of every Prophet, and secondly, to 
liberate the Israelites from the bondage of Pharaoh, which was specifically 
assigned to them. The Qur`an has mentioned sometimes only the first part of 
their Mission (as in Surah An-Nazi`at) and sometimes only the second.<br><br>
14This remark of Pharaoh shows that he was not the same Pharaoh who had brought 
up Moses in his house, but his son. Had he been the same Pharaoh, he would have 
said, "I brought you up." But, on the contrary. he says, "You were brought up 
among ourselves." For a detailed discussion, see E.N.'s 85-93 of Al A'raf. <br>
<br>15The allusion is to the incident of murder committed by Moses accidentally.
<br><br>16The word dalalat does not always mean "straying away", but it is also 
used in the sense of ignorance, folly, error, forgetfulness, inadvertence, etc. 
As mentioned in Surah Al-Qasas, Prophet Moses had only given a blow to the 
Egyptian (Copt) when he saw him treating an Israelite cruelly. A blow does not 
cause death, nor is it given with the intention of causing death. It was only an 
accident that the Egyptian died. As such, it was not a case of deliberate murder 
but of accidental murder. A murder was committed but not intentionally, nor was 
any weapon used, which is usually employed for murder, or which can cause 
murder. <br><br>17The word hukm means wisdom, knowledge or authority, which is 
granted by Allah to a Prophet so that he may speak with confidence and power.
<br><br>18That is, "If you had not been unjust and cruel to the Israelites. I 
should not have been brought to your house for upbringing. It was only on 
account of your barbarism that my mother put me in a basket and cast it into the 
river. Had it not been so, I should have been happily brought up in my own 
house. Therefore, it does not behoove you to remind me of your favor of bringing 
me up in your house."<br><br>19Here the details that Prophet Moses went before 
Pharaoh as the Messenger of the Lord of the universe and conveyed to him His 
message, have been omitted, and only the conversation that took place between 
them has been related.<br><br>20This question of Pharaoh concerned the assertion 
of Moses that he had been sent by the Lord, Master and Ruler of all Creation 
with the message that he should let the Israelites go with him. This was a 
political message. It implied that the One, Whom Moses claimed to represent, 
possessed authority and sovereign rights over all the people of the world 
including Pharaoh and that he was not only encroaching upon his sphere of 
sovereignty as Supreme Ruler, but was also sending him the Command that he 
should hand over a section of his subjects to the representative appointed by 
Him, so that he should take them out of his kingdom. That is why Pharaoh asked, 
"Who is this Master and Ruler of all Creation who is sending such a command to 
the king of Egypt through an ordinary subject of his kingdom?"<br><br>21That is, 
"I have not been sent by any mortal king ruling in the world, but I come from 
Him Who is the Owner of the heavens and the earth. If you believe that, there is 
a Creator and Master and Ruler of this universe, it should not he difficult for 
you to understand who is the Lord of all Creation."<br><br>22These words were 
addressed to the chiefs of Pharaoh, whom he had asked, "Do you hear?" Prophet 
Moses said: "I do not believe in the false gods who exist today, but did not 
exist yesterday, or who existed yesterday but do not exist today. This Pharaoh, 
whom you worship as your lord today, did not exist yesterday, and the Pharaohs 
whom your elders worshiped yesterday, do not exist today; whereas I believe in 
the sovereignty and authority of that Lord Who is both your Lord and Pharaoh's 
Lord as much today as He was your elders' Lord before this." <br><br>23That is, 
"You regard me as a mad person, but if you think you are wise people, you should 
yourself decide as to who is the real lord: this wretched Pharaoh who is ruling 
over a small piece of earth, or He Who is the Owner of the east and the west and 
of everything bounded by the east and the west including the land of Egypt. I 
believe in His sovereignty alone and have been sent to convey His message to a 
creature of His." <br><br>24To understated and appreciate this conversation 
fully, one should bear in mind the fact that as it is today, in the ancient 
times too, the concept of "deity" was confined to its religious sense only. The 
deity was meant to be worshiped and presented offerings and gifts, and because 
of its "supernatural powers" and authority the people were to pray to it for 
help and fulfillment of their desires. But a deity's being supreme legally and 
politically also and his right to enjoin anything he pleased in the mundane 
affairs and man's duty to submit to his commands as to superior law, has never 
been recognized by the so-called worldly rulers. They have always claimed that 
in the mundane affairs, they alone possess absolute authority and no deity has 
any right to interfere in the polity and law prescribed by them. This very thing 
has been the real cause of the conflict between the Prophets and their righteous 
followers, on the one hand, and the worldly kingdoms and governments on the 
other. The Prophets have been trying their utmost to make the worldly rulers 
acknowledge the sovereign and absolute rights of the Lord of the Worlds, but 
they in return have not only been claiming sovereign powers and rights for 
themselves, but have been considering every such person as a criminal and rebel, 
who has held someone else as a deity in the political and legal sphere. With 
this background one can easily understand the real significance of Pharaoh's 
words. Had it been a question of mere worship and offerings, he would have least 
bothered that Moses, forsaking all gods, regarded only Allah, the Lord of all 
Creation, as worthy of those rights. if Moses had invited him to serve Allah 
alone, he would not have felt provoked and offended. At the most he would have 
refused to give up the creed of his forefathers, or would have challenged Moses 
to have a debate with his own religious scholars. But what caused him 
provocation was that Prophet Moses was presenting himself as the representative 
of the Lord of all Creation and was conveying to him a political command as if 
he was a subordinate ruler and the representative of the superior authority was 
demanding obedience from him to the command. In this sense, he was not prepared 
to acknowledge any other political or legal authority, nor allow any of his 
subjects to acknowledge anybody instead of himself as the supreme ruler. That is 
why he challenged the teen "Lord, of all Creation", for the message sent by Him 
clearly reflected sovereignty in the political and trot in the mere religious 
sense. Then, when Prophet Moses explained over and over again what he meant by 
the "Lord of all Creation", Pharaoh threatened that if he held any one other 
than him as sovereign in the land of Egypt, he would be cast into prison.<br>
<br>25That is, "Will you still deny me and send me to prison, even if I present 
a convincing Sign to prove that I am really the Messenger of God, Who is Lord of 
all Creation , Lord of the heavens and the earth and Lord of the east and the 
west?<br><br>26This reply of Pharaoh shows that he was not in any way different 
from the common polytheists of the ancient and modern times. Like all other 
polytheists he believed in Allah's being the highest Deity in the supernatural 
sense. Who wielded greater power and authority than all other gods and 
goddesses. That is why Prophet Moses said to him, "If you do not believe that I 
have been appointed by Allah, I can present such clear Signs as will prove that 
I have really been sent by Him", and that is why Pharaoh said, " I f you are 
true in your claim, come out with your Sign", otherwise if he had any doubt 
about the existence of Allah or His being Master of the universe, he would not 
have asked for the Sign.<br><br>27Thub an means a serpent. At other places, the 
Qur'an has used hayyatun (snake) and jaann (a small snake) to describe the snake 
of the staff. The interpretation given by Imam Razi is that the snake of the 
staff looked like a serpent from its big size and has been called jaann on 
account of its swift movement which is characteristic of small snakes.<br><br>
28Some commentators under the influence of the Israelite traditions have 
translated baida' as white and have taken it to mean that the healthy hand when 
drawn out of the armpit became white as if struck by leprosy. But commentators 
like Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir, Zamakhshari, Razi, Abul Sa'ud `Imadi, Alusi and 
others are agreed that baida' here means shining and bright. As soon as Prophet 
Moses took out his hand from the armpit, it made the whole place bright as if by 
the sun. For further explanation, see E.N. 13 of Ta Ha.<br><br>29The impact of 
the two miracles can be judged from the fact that a moment before this Pharaoh 
was calling Moses a mad man, because he had claimed to be a Prophet and had had 
the boldness to openly demand release of the Israelites. He was also threatening 
Moses that if he took somebody else as Lord instead of him, he would cast him 
into the prison for life. But, after he had seen the Signs, he became so 
terror-stricken that he felt his kingdom to be at stake, and in his contusion he 
did not realize that he was talking meaninglessly to his servants in the court. 
Two men from the oppressed community of the Israelites were standing before the 
most powerful ruler of the time: they had no military force with them, they 
belonged to a weak and lifeless community, and there was no sign of any 
rebellion in any corner of the country, nor did they have the support of any 
foreign power, yet as soon as the miracles of the snake of the staff and the 
shining hand were shown, the tyrant desperately cried out: "These two men want 
to seize power and deprive the ruling class of their sovereign rights!" His 
apprehension that Moses would do so by force of his magic again reflected a 
confused state of mind, for nowhere in the world has a political revolution been 
ever brought about, nor a country taken, nor a war won merely by force of 
tragic. There were many magicians in Egypt, who could perform masterly tricks of 
tragic, but Pharaoh knew it well that they were nonentities because they 
performed magic only for the sake of rewards. <br><br>30This sentence further 
shows Pharaoh's perplexed state of mind. A moment before he was the deity of his 
courtiers and, now, struck by awe, the deity is asking his servants as to what 
he should do to meet the dangerous situation.<br><br>31As already mentioned in 
Surah Ta Ha (v. 59), the day fixed for the purpose was the day of the national 
festivities of the Egyptians so that large crowds of people coming to the 
festivals from every part of the country should also witness the grand "contest 
which was to be held in the broad daylight so that the spectators could see the 
performances clearly. <br><br>32That is, besides proclamation heralds were sent 
to urge the people to come and see the contest. It appears that the news of the 
miracle shown by Prophet Moses before the packed court had reached the common 
people also, and Pharaoh fearing that the people at large might be influenced, 
wanted that they should come together in large numbers so that they could see 
for themselves that turning a staff into a snake had nothing extraordinary in it 
because such a trick could be performed by every common magician of their own 
country as well.<br><br>33This sentence confirms the idea that those who had 
witnessed the miracle of Moses in the royal court and those who had heard of it 
reliably outside were losing faith in their ancestral religion, and now the 
strength of their faith depended on this that their own magicians also should 
give a performance similar to that of Moses. That is why Pharaoh and his chiefs 
themselves regarded this contest as a decisive one, and their heralds were busy 
moving about in the land, impressing on the people that if the magicians won the 
day, they would yet be secured against the risk of being won over to Moses' 
religion, otherwise there was every possibility of their creed's being exposed 
and abandoned for ever.<br><br>34Such was the mentality of the supporters of the 
polytheistic creed of the land, whose only ambition was to win rewards from the 
king if they won the day.<br><br>35This was then the highest honor that the king 
could confer on those who served the creed best Thus, at the very outset, 
Pharaoh and his magicians manifested by their conduct the great moral 
distinction that exists between a Prophet and a magician. On the one side, there 
stood that embodiment of courage and confidence, who in spite of belonging to 
the suppressed community of the Israelites and having remained to hiding for ten 
long years on account of a charge of murder, had suddenly appeared in Pharaoh's 
court to proclaim fearlessly that he had been sent by the Lord of all Creation 
and demanded release of the Israelites.<br><br>He did not even feel the least 
hesitation in starting a discussion face to face with Pharaoh not caring in' the 
least for his threats. On the other side, there were the wretched magicians 
wholly lacking in moral fiber, who had been summoned by Pharaoh himself to help 
secure the ancestral religion, and yet they were begging for rewards in return 
for the services. And when they are told that they will not only be given 
rewards but will also be included among the royal courtiers, they feel greatly 
overjoyed. These two types of characters clearly bring out the difference 
between the grand personality of a Prophet and that of a mere magician. Unless a 
man loses all sense of modesty and decency, he cannot have the audacity to call 
a Prophet a magician.<br><br>36As soon as they cast down their cords and staffs, 
these started moving like so many snakes- towards Moses. This has been described 
in greater detail at other places in the Qur'an. According to Al-A`raf: 116: 
"When they threw down their devices, they bewitched the eyes of the people and 
terrified their hearts: for they had indeed produced a great magic." And 
according to Ta Ha: 66, 67: "Suddenly it so appeared to Moses that their cords 
and staffs were running about by the power of their magic, and Moses' heart was 
filled with fear."<br><br>37This was not merely an acknowledgment of their 
defeat at the hands of Moses as though he was a greater magician, but their 
falling prostrate in submission to Allah, Lord of the universe, was an open 
declaration before thousands of Egyptians that what Moses had brought about was 
no magic at all, but a manifestation of the powers of Allah, Almighty.<br><br>
38This only shows the extreme obstinacy and obduracy of Pharaoh, who even after 
witnessing a clear miracle and the testimony of the magicians on it, was still 
insisting that it was magic. But according to Al-A`raf: 123, Pharaoh said, 
"Indeed it was a plot you conspired in the capital to deprive the rightful 
owners of their power." Thus he tried to make the people believe that the 
magicians had yielded to Moses not because of the miracle but due to a 
conspiracy with Moses before they entered the contest, so that they might seize 
political power and enjoy its fruits together.<br><br>39This horrible threat was 
held out by Pharaoh to justify his thinking that the magicians had entered a 
conspiracy with Moses. He thought that the magicians, in order to save their 
lives, would confess the plot and thus the effect produced by their falling 
prostrate and believing in Moses in front of thousands of spectators would be 
gone.<br><br>40That is, "We have to return to our Lord in any case. If you kill 
us now, we shall present ourselves before Him just today, and we have nothing to 
worry in this. We rather expect that we shall be forgiven our sins and errors 
because out of this entire gathering we were the first to believe as soon as 
reality became known to us."<br><br>This reply of the magicians made two things 
absolutely clear to the people who had been gathered together by Pharaoh heralds<br>
<br>First, that Pharaoh was a dishonest obdurate and deceitful person. When he 
saw that Moses had come out successful in the contest which he himself had 
arranged to be decisive, he concocted a plot and forced the magicians to confess 
it by coercion and threats. Had there been any truth in it, the magicians would 
not have readily offered to have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides 
and get crucified. The fact that the magicians remained steadfast and firm in 
their belief even in the face of such a horrible threat, proves that the 
accusation of plotting a conspiracy against Pharaoh was baseless. The fact was 
that the magicians being experts in their art had realized that what Moses had 
displayed was no magic, but surely a manifestation of the powers of Allah, Lord 
of the universe.<br><br>Secondly, thousands of the people who had gathered 
together from all corners of the land had themselves witnessed the great moral 
change that had occurred in the magicians as soon as they professed belief in 
the Lord of the universe. The same magicians who had been summoned to strengthen 
and secure the ancestral creed by means of their magic and who, a minute before, 
were humbly begging Pharaoh for rewards had now become so bold and ennobled 
spiritually that they would not take any notice of Pharaoh's powers and his 
threats and were even prepared to face death and extreme physical torture for 
the sake of their Faith. Thus psychologically there could not be a better 
occasion to expose the polytheistic creed of the Egyptians in their own eyes and 
help impress the truth of Moses' religion in the minds of the people.<br><br>
41The mention of migration here does not mean that Prophet Moses and the 
Israelites were immediately ordered to leave Egypt. The history of the 
intervening period has been related in Al-A`raf: 127-135 and Yunus: 83-89, and a 
part of it has been mentioned in Al-Mu`min: 23-46 and Az-Zukhruf: 46-56. Here 
the story is being cut short and only the final phase of the conflict between 
Pharaoh and Prophet Moses is given to show the tragic end of Pharaoh who had 
remained obdurate even after witnessing clear Signs and the ultimate success of 
Moses who had Divine support behind his message.<br><br>42The warning that "you 
will be pursued" shows the wisdom of the instruction to set off during the 
night. The idea was that before Pharaoh came out with his hosts to pursue them, 
they should have gone far enough so as to be out of reach of him. It should be 
borne in mind that the Israelites were not settled in one place in Egypt but 
were scattered in cities and habitations all over the country and lived in large 
numbers especially in the land between Memphis and Rameses called Goshen. (See 
map in Vol . III, p. 31, on the Exodus of the Israelites). It appears that when 
Prophet Moses was commanded to leave Egypt, he must have sent instructions to 
the Israelite habitations telling the people to make necessary preparations' for 
migration and he must have also fixed a night for them to leave their homes for 
the exodus. <br><br>43All this shows that Pharaoh in fact was terror-stricken, 
but was trying to hide his fear under cover of fearlessness. On the one hand, he 
was mobilizing forces to face the situation; on the other, he wanted to show 
that he was undaunted and undeterred, for a despotic ruler like Pharaoh could 
have no danger from a suppressed and slave community which had been living in 
disgrace for centuries. That is why his heralds made the people believe that the 
Israelites were just a handful of people, who could do them no harm, but had to 
be punished for the provocation they had caused. As for mobilization it was only 
a precautionary measure which had been taken to meet any eventuality in time.
<br><br>44The genera'. mobilization ordered by Pharaoh was aimed to crush the 
Israelites completely, but God's device turned the tables on him and drew out 
all his chiefs and courtiers from their dwelling places and drove them to the 
place where they and their hosts were to be drowned all together. Had they not 
pursued the Israelites, nothing would have happened save that a community would 
have left the country quietly and they would have continued to enjoy life in 
their fine dwellings as before. But they in fact had cleverly planned not to 
allow the Israelites go away peacefully, but to attack the migrating caravans 
suddenly to finish them completely. For this very purpose the princes and the 
high chiefs and the nobles came out of their palaces and joined Pharaoh in the 
campaign, but their cleverness did not avail them anything. Not only did the 
Israelites succeed in escaping from Egypt, but also at the same time the elite 
of Pharaoh's tyrannical kingdom perished in the sea.<br><br>45Some commentators 
have interpreted this verse to mean that Allah made the Children of Israel to 
inherit the gardens, water-springs, treasure-houses and fine dwellings vacated 
and left behind by Pharaoh and his people. This would inevitably mean that after 
the drowning of Pharaoh, the Israelites returned to Egypt and took possession of 
the wealth and properties of Pharaoh's people. This interpretation, however, is 
neither supported by history nor by other verses of the Qur'an. The relevant 
verses of Surahs AI-Baqarah, AI-Ma'idah, AI-A`raf and Ta Ha confirm that after 
the destruction of Pharaoh in the sea, the Israelites did not return to Egypt 
but proceeded towards their destination (Palestine) and then, till the time of 
Prophet David (973-1013 B.C.) all the major events of their history took place 
in the lands which are now known as the Sinai Peninsula, northern Arabia, 
Transjordan and Palestine. As such, in our opinion the verses mean this: On the 
one hand, Allah deprived the people of Pharaoh of their wealth, possessions and 
grandeur, and on the other, He bestowed the same on the Children of Israel in 
Palestine, and not in Egypt. This same meaning is borne out by vv. 136-137 of 
A1-A'raf: "Then We took Our vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea 
because they had treated Our Signs as false and grown heedless of them. And 
after them We gave as heritage to those who had been abased and kept low, the 
eastern and the western parts of that land, which had been blessed bountifully 
by Us." The epithet of "the blessed land" has generally been used for Palestine 
in the Qur'an as in Surah Bani Isra'il: l, Al-Anbiya': 71-81, and Saba': 18. <br>
<br>46That is, "He will show me the way out of this calamity"<br><br>
47Literally, tawd is a high mountain. It appears that as soon as Prophet Moses 
struck the sea with his staff, it tore the sea asunder and the waters stood like 
two mighty mountains on the sides and remained in that condition for so long 
that, on the one hand, the Israelite caravans consisting of hundreds of 
thousands of the migrants were able to pass through safely, and on the other, 
Pharaoh and his hosts stepped in and reached the middle of the sea. In the 
natural course, a phenomenon like this has never occurred that due to a 
windstorm, however strong, the sea should have parted and stood like mighty 
mountains on either side for such a long time. According to verse 77 of Ta Ha, 
Prophet Moses was commanded by Allah "to make for them (the Israelites) a dry 
path across the sea. " This shows that the smiting of the sea did not only 
result in dividing the waters into two parts, which stood like mighty mountains 
on either side, but it also created a dry path in between without any mud or 
slush. In this connection, one should also consider verse 24 of Surah Dukhan, 
which says that after Moses had crossed the sea along with his people, he was 
commanded by Allah "to let the sea remain as it is because Pharaoh is to be 
drowned in it." This implies that if after crossing the sea, Moses had again 
struck it with his staff, the two sides would have rejoined, but he was 
forbidden to do so. Obviously, this was a miracle, and the view of those who try 
to interpret it as a natural phenomenon, is belied. For explanation, see E.N. 53 
of Ta Ha. <br><br>48That is, Pharaoh and his army.<br><br>49That is, the Quraish 
have this lesson to learn from this: "The obdurate people like Pharaoh, his 
chiefs and followers had not believed even though they had been shown clear 
miracles for years. They had been so blinded by obduracy that even on the 
occasion of their drowning in the sea although they had seen the sea parting 
asunder in front of their very eyes, the waters standing like high mountains on 
either side, and the dry path in between for the Israelite caravans to pass, yet 
they failed to understand that Moses had Divine succor and support with him 
which they had come out to fight. At last when they came to their senses, it was 
too late, because they had been overtaken by the wrath of Allah and the sea 
waters had covered them completely. It was on this occasion that Pharaoh had 
cried out "I have believed that there is no god but the real God in Whom the 
Children of Israel have believed and I am of those who surrender." (Yunus: 90).<br>
<br>On the other hand, there is a Sign in this for the believers, too. They 
should understand how Allah by His grace causes the Truth to prevail in the long 
run and the falsehood to vanish even though the forces to evil may appear to be 
dominant for the time being .<br><br>50This part of the life-history of Prophet 
Abraham relates to the time when after his appointment to Prophethood, a 
conflict had started between him and his people on the questions of shirk and 
Tauhid. In this connection, the reader should also see Al-Baqarah: 258-260, Al-An`am: 
75-83, Maryam: 41-50, Al-Anbiya': 51-70, As- Saffat: 83-113, and Al-Mumtahanah: 
4-5.<br><br>The Qur'an has specially repeated this part of Prophet Abraham's 
life story over and over again because the Arabs in general and the Quraish in 
particular regarded themselves as his followers and professed his way and creed. 
Besides them, the Christians and the Jews also claimed that Abraham was their 
religious leader and guide. That is why the Qur'an admonishes them over and over 
again that the creed brought by Abraham was Islam itself, which is now being 
presented by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), and which 
they are opposing tooth and nail. Prophet Abraham was not a mushrik, but an 
antagonist against shirk, and for the same reason he had to leave his home and 
country and live as a migrant in Syria, Palestine and Hejaz. Thus he was neither 
a Jew nor a Christian, because Judaism and Christianity appeared centuries after 
him. This historical argument could neither be refuted by the mushriks, nor by 
the Jews or the Christians, because the mushriks themselves admitted that 
idol-worship in Arabia had started several centuries after Prophet Abraham, and 
the Jews and the Christians also could not deny that Prophet Abraham had lived 
long before the beginning of Judaism and Christianity. This obviously meant that 
the special beliefs and customs which those people thought formed the basis of 
their religion, were not part of the original religion taught by Prophet 
Abraham. True religion was the one which had no tinge of those impurities, but 
was based on those worship and obedience of One Allah alone. That is why the 
Qur`an says:<br><br>"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a 
Muslim, sound in the Faith, and he was not of those who set up partners with 
Allah. Surely only those people who follow Abraham are entitled to claim a 
relationship with him. Now this Prophet and the believers are better entitled to 
this relationship." (Al An'am: 67, 68). <br><br>51Obviously the object of this 
question was to remind the people that the deities which they worshiped were 
false and absolutely powerless. In Surah Al Anbiya' the same question has been 
posed thus: "What are these images to which you are so devoted '?" (V. 52). <br>
<br>52Though everybody knew that they worshiped idols, their answer implied that 
they were firm in faith and their hearts were satisfied with it, as if to say, 
"We also know that these are idols of stone and wood, which we worship, but our 
faith demands that we should serve and worship them devotedly."<br><br>53That 
is, "We do not worship and serve them because they hear our prayers and 
supplications, or that they can harm and benefit us, but because we have seen 
our elders worshiping and serving them." Thus, they themselves admitted that the 
only reason of their worshiping the idols was the blind imitation of their 
forefathers. In other words, they meant this: "There is nothing new in what you 
are telling us, We know that these are idols of stone and wood, which do not 
hear anything, nor can harm or do good; but we cannot believe that our elders 
who have been worshiping them since centuries, generation after generation, were 
foolish people. They must have had some good reason for worshiping these 
lifeless images, so we are doing the same as we have full faith in them."<br>
<br>54That is, "Is it enough to say that a religion is true only because it has 
been held as such by their ancestors ? Should people, generation after 
generation, go on following their ancestors in their footsteps blindly without 
ever caring to see whether the deities they worship possess any divine attribute 
or not, and whether they have any power to influence their destinies?<br><br>
55That is "When I consider them, I see that if I worship them, I shall ruin 
myself both in this world and in the Hereafter. As their worship is clearly 
harmful, worshiping them is worshiping one's enemy." These words of Prophet 
Abraham bear a close connection with verses 81, 82 of Surah Maryam, which say: 
"These people have set up other gods than Allah so that they may become their 
supporters. But they will have no supporter; all of them will not only disown 
their worship but also become their opponents (on the Day of Judgment)."<br><br>
It should be noted that Prophet Abraham did not say, "They are enemies to you", 
but said, "They are enemies to me." In the first case, there was every chance 
that the people would have felt offended and provoked, because it would have 
been difficult for them to understand how their own gods could be their enemies. 
As a matter of fact, Prophet Abraham appealed to the natural feeling of man that 
he is his own well-wisher and cannot wish ill of himself deliberately. This 
would inevitably have led the addressees to think whether what they were doing 
was really for their good and was in no way harmful."<br><br>56That is, "Of all 
the deities who are being worshiped in the world, there is only One Allah alone, 
Lord of the universe, in whose worship I find any good for myself, and Whose 
worship is the worship of one's own Cherisher and Supporter, and not of one's 
enemy." Then Prophet Abraham briefly gives the arguments, which nobody could 
refute, as to why Allah alone is worthy of man's worship and indirectly suggests 
that his addressees (the idol-worshipers) had no rational basis for worshiping 
deities other than Allah except in blind imitation of their forefathers.<br><br>
57This is the first reason for which Allah, and One Allah alone, is worthy of 
man's worship. The people also knew and believed that Allah alone was their 
Creator without any partner. Not only they but all the polytheists of the world 
also have always held the belief that even the deities they worshiped were the 
creation of Allah, and except for the atheists none have ever denied that Allah 
is the Creator of the whole universe. This argument of Prophet Abraham implied 
that being a creature, he could only worship his Creator, Who was alone worthy 
of his worship, and none else, because none besides Allah had any share in His 
creation. <br><br>58The second reason for worshiping Allah and Allah alone is 
that Allah had not become unconcerned with man after creating him and let him 
alone to see other supporters for help, but had also taken the responsibility of 
making arrangements for his guidance, protection and fulfillment of his needs. 
The moment a human child is born, milk is produced for it in the breasts of its 
mother, and some unseen power teaches it the way to suck it and take it down the 
throat. From the first day of his life till his death, the Creator has provided 
in the world around him all necessary means required for every stage of his life 
for his development and guidance, sustenance and survival. He has also endowed 
him with all those powers and abilities which are needed to use the means with 
advantage and given him all necessary guidance for every sphere of life. Then 
for the protection of human life against all sorts of disease, germs and 
poisons, He has created such effective antidotes that they have not yet been 
fully encompassed by human knowledge. If these natural arrangements had not been 
made, even a thorn-prick would have proved fatal. When this all-pervading mercy 
and providence of the Creator is supporting and sustaining man at all times in 
every way, there could be no greater folly and ingratitude on the part of man 
than this that he should bow down before others than Allah and seek their help 
in need and trouble. <br><br>59The third reason for worshiping none but Allah is 
that man's relation with his God is not merely confined to this worldly life, 
which will end at death, but extends to life-after-death also. The same God Who 
brought him into existence, recalls him and there is no power which can stop his 
return froth the world. No remedy, no physician no god or goddess has ever been 
able to catch the hand which takes man out of this world. Even all those men who 
were made deities and worshiped, could not ward off their own deaths. Only Allah 
judges and decides when a particular person is to be recalled from the world, 
and whenever somebody is recalled by Him, he has to leave this world in any 
case. Then it is Allah alone Who will decide as to when He should raise back to 
life all those people who were born in this world and died and buried here, and 
ask them to account for their worldly lives. Then also nobody will have the 
power to stop resurrection of himself or others. Every human being will have to 
rise on the Command of Allah and appear in His Court. Then Allah alone will be 
the Judge on that Day, and nobody else will be a partner in his judgment in any 
degree. To punish or to forgive will be entirely in Allah's hand. Nobody will 
have the power to get somebody forgiven if Allah would want to punish him, and 
punished if Allah would want to forgive him All those who are regarded as 
intercessors in the world, will themselves be hoping for Allah's mercy and grace 
for their forgiveness. In view of these facts anybody who worships others than 
Allah, is in fact preparing for his own doom. There can be no greater misfortune 
than this that man should turn away from Allah Who controls his life here as 
well as in the Hereafter, and should turn for help and support to those who are 
utterly powerless in this regard. <br><br>60Hukm here does not mean "Prophethood", 
because at the time this prayer was made, Prophet Abraham had already been 
appointed a Prophet. Even if this prayer was made before that, Prophethood is 
not bestowed on request, but it is something which Allah Himself bestows on 
those He wills. That is why, hukm has been translated wisdom, knowledge, right 
understanding and power of judgment. The Holy Prophet is also reported to have 
made a similar prayer<br><br>Arinal-ashyaa' Kama hiya: "O Allah, give us the 
power to see and understand a thing as it really is and to form an opinion about 
it according to its reality."<br><br>61"Join me with the righteous": "Give me a 
righteous society to live in in this world and raise me along with the righteous 
in the Hereafter." To be raised back to life with the righteous and to attain 
one's salvation have one and the same meaning. Therefore, this should be the 
prayer of every person who believes in the life-after-death and in reward and 
punishment. Even in this world a pious man cherishes the desire that God should 
save him from living a life in an immoral and wicked society and should join him 
with the righteous people. A pious and righteous person will remain ill at ease 
and restless until either his own society should become clean and pure morally, 
or he leaves it to join another society which is practicing and following the 
principles of truth and honesty.<br><br>62"Grant me true renown among 
posterity": "Grant me the grace that posterity should remember me as a good and 
pious man after my death and not as one of the unjust people, who were not only 
wicked themselves, but who left nothing but wickedness behind them in the world. 
Enable me to perform such high deeds that my life should become a source of 
light for others for all times to come, and I should be counted among the 
benefactors of humanity." This is not a prayer for worldly greatness and renown, 
but for true greatness and renown, which can be achieved only as a result of 
solid and valuable services. A person's achieving such true renown and glory has 
two good aspects:<br><br>(1) The people of the world get a good example to 
follow, as against bad examples, which inspires them with piety and encourages 
them to follow the right way; and<br><br>(2) The righteous person will not only 
get the rewards of works done by posterity who were guided aright by the good 
example left and set by him, but in addition to his own good works, he will have 
the evidence of the millions of people in his favor that he had left behind him 
in the world fountains of guidance, which went on benefiting people, generation 
after generation, till the Day of Resurrection.<br><br>63Some commentators have 
interpreted this prayer of Prophet Abraham for his father's forgiveness to imply 
that he had prayed to God to grant his father the favor to accept Islam because 
forgiveness in any case is inter-linked with and dependent upon Faith. But this 
interpretation is not borne out by the other verses of the Qur'an. The Qur'an 
says that when Prophet Abraham left his home at the tyrannical treatment of his 
father, he said, "I bid farewell to you; I shall pray to my Lord to forgive you 
for He is very kind to me." (Maryam: 47) To fulfill this promise, he not only 
prayed for the forgiveness of his father, but for both his parents: "Lord, 
forgive me and my parents..." (Ibrahim: 41). But afterwards he himself realized 
that an enemy of the Truth, even if he be the father of a believer, does not 
deserve a prayer of forgiveness. Thus according to verse 114 of At Taubah: "The 
prayer of Abraham for his father was only to fulfill a promise he had made to 
him, but when he realized that he was an enemy of Allah, he disowned him."<br>
<br>64That is, "Do not put me to disgrace on the Day of Judgment by inflicting 
punishment on my father in front of all mankind, when I myself shall be 
witnessing his punishment helplessly."<br><br>65It cannot be said with certainty 
whether vv. 88, 89 are a part of Prophet Abraham's prayer, or they are an 
addition by Allah. In the first case, they will mean that Prophet Abraham while 
praying for his father had a full realization of these facts. In the second 
case, they will be a comment by Allah on Abraham's prayer, as if to say, "On the 
Day of Judgment, only a sound heart, sound in faith and free from disobedience 
and sin, will be of any avail to man and not wealth and children, for wealth and 
children can be useful only if one possesses a sound heart. Wealth will be 
useful if one would have spent it sincerely and faithfully for the sake of 
Allah, otherwise even a millionaire will be a poor man there. Children also will 
he of help only to the extent that a person might have educated them in Faith 
and good conduct to the best of his ability; otherwise even if the son is a 
Prophet, his father will not escape punishment, if he died in the state of 
unbelief, because such a father will have no share in the goodness of his 
children. "<br><br>66Verses 90-102 do not seem to be a part of Prophet Abraham's 
speech, but they are Allah's words.<br><br>67That is, on the one hand, the 
righteous people will be shown the countless blessings which they will enjoy in 
Paradise by Allah's grace, and on the other, Hell will be set open with all its 
dreads and horrors before the straying people, when they will still be in the 
Plain of Resurrection.<br><br>68Kubkibu in the Text has two meanings: (1) They 
will be hurled into Hell one upon the other; and (2) they will go on rolling 
down into the depths of Hell. <br><br>69This is how the followers will treat 
their religious leaders and guides, whom they served and revered like deities in 
the world, whose words and patterns of behavior they took as authoritative and 
before whom they presented all sorts of offerings in the world. In the Hereafter 
when the people will find that their guides had misled them and caused their 
ruin as well as their own, they will hold them responsible for it and will curse 
them. The Qur'an has presented this horrible scene of the Hereafter at several 
places so as to admonish the blind followers to see and judge carefully whether 
their guides in this world were leading them on the right path or not. For 
instance: "As each generation will be entering Hell, it will curse its preceding 
generation till all generations shall be gathered together there; then each 
succeeding generation will say regarding the preceding one, `O Lord, these were 
the people who led us astray; therefore give them a double chastisement of the 
Fire.' Allah will reply, `There is a double chastisement for every one but you 
know it not'." (Al-A`raf: 38). "And the disbelievers will say, `Our Lord, bring 
those jinns and men before us, who led us astray so that we may trample them 
under our feet and put them to extreme disgrace'." (Ha Mim Sajdah: 29). "And 
they will say, `Our Lord, we obeyed our chiefs and our great men and they misled 
us from the right path; our Lord, give them a double chastisement and curse them 
with a severe curse'." (Al-Ahzab: 67-68). <br><br>70That is, "Those whom we 
regarded as our intercessors in the world and who, we believed, would take us 
safely into Paradise, are utterly helpless today and of no avail to us." <br>
<br>71That is, "We have no sympathizer either who could feel for us and console 
us." The Qur'an says that in the Hereafter only the believers will continue to 
be friends; as for the disbelievers, they will turn enemies of one another even 
though they had been sworn friends in the world. Each will hold the other as 
responsible for the doom and try to get him maximum punishment. "Friends on that 
Day will become enemies of one another except the righteous (who will continue 
to be friends)." (Az-Zukhruf: 67).<br><br>72That Qur'an has given an answer to 
this kind of longing and desire as well:".. evenif they be sent back to the 
earthly life, they would do all that they had been forbidden to do." (Al-An`am: 
28). As for the reasons why they will not be allowed to return to the world, 
please see E.N.'s 90-92 of Al-Mu'minun above. <br><br>73There are two aspects of 
the Sign in the story of Prophet Abraham: (I) On the one hand, the mushriks of 
Arabia, especially the Quraish, claimed that they were the followers of Prophet 
Abraham and were proud of being his descendants, but on the other, they were 
involved in shirk against which Prophet Abraham had been engaged in a relentless 
struggle throughout his life. Then these people were opposing and treating the 
Prophet who was inviting them towards the religion brought by Prophet Abraham in 
the like manner as Prophet Abraham himself had been opposed and treated by his 
people. They have been reminded that Abraham was an enemy of shirk and an 
upholder of Tauhid which they themselves admitted, and yet they persisted in 
their obduracy to follow the creed of shirk. (2) The people of Abraham were 
eliminated from the world: 'if any of them survived, it was the children of 
Prophet Abraham and his sons, Ishmael and Isaac (thay Allah's peace be upon 
them). Though the Qur'an does not mention the torment that descended on 
Abraham's people after he had left them, it has included them among the 
tormented tribes: "Has not the story reached them of those who had gone before 
them: the people of Noah, the tribes of `Ad and Thamud, the people of Abraham, 
and the inhabitants of Midian and of the overturned cities ?" (At Taubah: 70).
<br><br>74For comparison, see AI-A`raf: 59-64, Yunus: 71-73, Hud: 25-48, Bani 
Isra'il: 3, Al-Anbiya' 76-77, Al-Mu'minun:: 23-30, and Al-Furqan: 37. For the 
details of the story of Prophet Noah, see AI-'Ankabut:15, As-Saffat: 75-82, 
AIQamar: 9-15 and Surah Nuh itself. <br><br>75Though they had rejected only one 
Messenger, it amounted to rejecting all the messengers because all of them had 
brought one and the same message from Allah. This is an important fact which the 
Qur'an has mentioned over and over again in different ways. Thus, even those 
people who rejected just one Prophet have been regarded as unbelievers though 
they believed in all other Prophets, for the simple reason that the believer in 
the truth of one Messenger cannot deny the same truth in other cases unless he 
does so on account of racial prejudice, imitation of elders, etc. <br><br>76The 
initial address of Prophet Noah to his people, as mentioned at other places in 
the Qur'an, was as follows: "O my people, worship Allah alone: you have no other 
deity than Him. Are you not afraid (of Him)?" (Al-Mu'minun: 23); and "Worship 
Allah and fear Him and obey me." (Nuh: 3). That is, "Are you not afraid of the 
consequences of adopting an attitude of rebellion against Allah and worshiping 
others than Him? <br><br>77It has two meanings: (1) "1 present before you 
nothing but what Allah reveals to me;" and (2) "I am a Messenger whom you have 
already known to be a trustworthy and honest and righteous man. When I have been 
honest and true in my dealings with you, how can 1 be dishonest and 
untrustworthy in conveying the Message of God'? Therefore, you should rest 
assured that whatever I am presenting is the Truth. " <br><br>78That is, "When I 
am a truthful and trustworthy Messenger, you are duty-bound to obey me alone as 
against all other patrons, and carry out my commands and instructions, because I 
represent the will of God: obedience to me is in fact obedience to God and 
disobedience to me is disobedience to Him." In other words, the people are not 
only required to accept a Messenger as a true Messenger sent by Allah, but it 
inevitably implies that they have to obey him and follow his Law against all 
other laws. To reject a Prophet, or to disobey him after accepting him as a 
Prophet, is tantamount to rebellion against God, which inevitably leads to His 
wrath. The words "fear Allah" are, therefore, a warning that every heater should 
clearly understand the consequences of rejecting the message of a Messenger or 
of disobeying his commands. <br><br>79This is the second of the two arguments of 
Prophet Noah about the truth of his message, the first being that they had known 
him as a trustworthy man during his earlier life, which he had lived among them. 
This second argument implies this: "I do not have any selfish motive or personal 
interest in conveying the message which I am propagating day and night in spite 
of all sorts of opposition and antagonism from you. At least you should 
understand this that 1 am sincere in my invitation, and am presenting honestly 
only that which I believe to be the truth and in following which I see the true 
success and well-being of humanity at large. I have no personal motive in this 
that I should fabricate falsehood to fool the people."<br><br>These two 
arguments are among the most important arguments which the Qur'an has advanced 
repeatedly as proofs of the truthfulness of the Prophets, and which it presents 
as criterion for judging Prophethood. A man who before Prophethood has lived a 
life in a society and has always been found to be honest, truthful and 
righteous, cannot be doubted even by a prejudiced person that he would suddenly 
start fabricating falsehood in the name of Allah and making people believe that 
he has been appointed a Prophet by Him, whereas he has been not. More important 
than that: such a lie cannot be fabricated with a good intention unless somebody 
has a selfish motive attached to this kind of fraud. And even when a person 
indulges in this sort of fraud, he cannot hide it completely from the people. 
The foul means and devices adopted by him to promote his "business" become known 
and all the various selfish interests and gains become all too apparent. 
Contrary to this, the personal life of a Prophet is full of moral excellencies: 
it has no trace of the employment of foul means and devices. Not to speak of any 
personal interest, he expends whatever he has for the cause of a mission which 
to all appearances is fruitless. No person who possesses any common sense and 
also has a sense of justice, can ever imagine that a sensible man who was 
leading a perfectly peaceful life, would come out all of a sudden with a false 
claim, when such a false claim does not do him any good, but on the contrary, 
demands all his money, time and energy and earns him nothing in return but the 
antagonism and hostility of the whole world. Sacrifice of personal interests is 
the foremost proof of a man's sincerity; therefore, doubting the intentions and 
sincerity of a person who has been sacrificing his personal interests for years 
and years can only be the pastime of the one who himself is selfish and 
insincere. 'Please also see E.N. 70 of AI-Mu'minun above. <br><br>80Repetition 
of this sentence is not without reason. In the first case Iv. I U8), it implied 
this: "You should fear Allah if you treat as false a true and trustworthy 
Messenger from Him, whom you yourselves have been regarding as a true and 
trustworthy man in the past." Here it means: "You should fear Allah if you doubt 
the intention of a person who is working sincerely only for the reformation of 
the people without any personal interest." This thing has been stressed because 
the chiefs of Prophet Noah's people, in order to find fault with his message of 
Truth, accused him of struggling merely for his personal superiority: "He merely 
intends to obtain superiority over you." (Al-Mu'minun: 24) <br><br>81This answer 
to Prophet Noah's message of Truth was given by the chiefs, elders and nobles of 
his people as mentioned in Hud: 27: "In answer to this, those chiefs of his 
people, who had rejected his message, said, 'We see that you are no more than a 
mere man like ourselves, and we also see that only the meanest from among us 
have become your followers without due consideration, and we find nothing in you 
that might give you superiority over us'." This shows that those who believed in 
Prophet Noah were mostly the poor people, and ordinary workmen, or some youth 
who enjoyed no position in society. As for the influential and rich people, they 
had become his bitter opponents, and were trying by every trick and allurement 
to keep the common man behind them. One of the arguments they advanced against 
Prophet Noah was this: "Had there been some weight and substance in Noah's 
message, the rich people, scholars, religious divines, nobles and wise people of 
the community should have accepted it, but none of them has believed in him; the 
only people to follow him are the foolish people belonging to the lowest stratum 
of society, who have no common-sense. Now how can the noble and high ranking 
people like us join the company of the common people?"<br><br>Precisely the same 
thing was being said by the unbelieving Quraish about the Holy Prophet and his 
followers. Abu Sufyan in reply to the questions asked by Heraclius had said: 
"Muhammad (Allah"s peace be upon him) has been followed by the poor and weak of 
our people." What they seemed to be thinking was that Truth was that which was 
considered as Truth by the chiefs and elders of the community, for only they had 
the necessary common-sense and power of judgment. As for the common people, 
their being common was a proof that they lacked sense and judgment. As such, if 
a thing was accepted by them but rejected by the chiefs, it meant that the thing 
itself was without worth and value. The disbelievers of Makkah even went 
further. They argued that a Prophet could not be a common man: if God had to 
appoint a Prophet, He would have appointed a great chief to be a Prophet: "They 
say: why has not the Qur'an been sent down to a prominent man of our two cities 
(Makkah and Ta'if)?" (Az-Zukhruf: 31).<br><br>82This is the first answer to 
their objection, which was based on the assumption that the poor people 
belonging to the working classes and lower social strata who performed humble 
duties, did not possess any mental maturity and were without intelligence and 
common sense. Therefore, their belief was without any rational basis, and so 
unreliable, and their deeds were of no value at all. To this Prophet Noah 
replies, "I have no means of judging the motives and assessing the worth of the 
deeds of the people who accept my message and act accordingly. This is not my 
concern but the responsibility of God".<br><br>83This is the second answer to 
their objection, which implied that since those who were gathering around Noah 
as believers, belonged to the lowest social strata, none of the nobles would 
like to join them, as if to say, "O Noah, should we believe in you in order to 
be counted among the low-ranking people like the slaves and servants and 
workmen?" To this Prophet Noah answers, "How can I adopt this irrational 
attitude that I should attend earnestly to those who do not like to listen to 
me, but drive away those who have believed and followed me? I am simply, a 
warner, who has declared openly that the way you are following is wrong and will 
lead you to ruin, and the way that I am inviting to is the way of salvation far 
all. Now it is up to you whether you heed my warning and adopt the right path, 
or go on following blindly the way to your ruin. It does not behoove me that I 
should start inquiring into the castes and ancestry and trades of the people who 
have heeded my warning and adopted the right path. They might be "mean" in your 
sight, but I cannot drive them away and wait to see when the "nobles" will' give 
up the path of destruction and adopt the way of salvation and success instead."<br>
<br>Precisely the same thing was going on between the Holy Prophet and the 
disbelievers of Makkah when these verses were revealed, and one can fully 
understand why the dialogue between Prophet Noah and the chiefs of his people, 
has been related here. The chiefs of the disbelievers of Makkah thought exactly 
the same way. They said how they could sit side by side with the slaves like 
Bilal, 'Ammar and Suhaib and other men of the working class, as if to say, 
"Unless these poor people are turned out, there can be no possibility that the 
nobles may consider to become believers; it is impossible that the master and 
the slave should stand shoulder to shoulder with each other." In answer to this 
the Holy Prophet was commanded by Allah to tell the vain and arrogant 
disbelievers plainly that the poor believers could not be driven out of Islam 
just for their sake: "O Muhammad, you attend earnestly to him who has shown 
indifference (to your message), whereas you have no responsibility if he does 
not reform himself; and the one who comes to you earnestly, fearing Allah, to 
him you pay no attention. Nay! this indeed is an Admonition, so let him who 
wills, accept it." (`Abasa :5-12).<br><br>"And do not drive away those who 
invoke their Lord morning and evening and are engaged in seeking His favor. You 
are not in any way accountable for them, nor are they in any way accountable for 
you: so, if you should drive them away, you shall be counted among the unjust. 
As a matter of fact, in this way We have made some of them a means of test for 
others, so that, seeing them, they should say, `Are these the people from among 
us upon whom Allah has showered His blessings?' Yes: does not Allah know His 
grateful servants better than they?" (AI-An'am: 52-53)<br><br>84The words in the 
Text may have two meanings: (1) "You will be stoned to death"; and (2) "You will 
be showered with abuses from all sides, and cursed and reviled wherever you go. 
"<br><br>85That is, "They have rejected me completely and absolutely and now 
there is no hope of their becoming believers." Here nobody should have the 
misunderstanding that just after this conversation between Prophet Noah and the 
chiefs of his people, and the rejection of his message by them, the Prophet 
submitted a report to Allah that his people had rejected him and now He should 
settle the accounts between them. The Qur'an has mentioned at different places 
the details of the long struggle that went on for centuries between Prophet Noah 
and his people, who persisted in unbelief. According to verse 14 of Surah Al 
Ankabut, the struggle continued for 950 years: "He (Noah) remained among them 
for a thousand years save fifty years." Prophet Noah during this long period 
studied their collective behavior, generation after generation, and came to the 
conclusion that they had no inclination to accept the Truth, and formed the 
opinion that in their future generations also there was no hope of anybody 
becoming a believer and adopting the righteous attitude: "My Lord, if You should 
leave them, they will lead Your servants astray, and they will bear as children 
none but sinners and disbelievers." (Nuh: 27). Allah Himself confirmed this 
opinion of Noah, saying, "No more of your people will believe in you now than 
those who have already believed. So do not grieve at their misdeeds." (Hud: 36)
<br><br>86"Deliver me and the believers with me to safety": "You should not only 
give Your judgment as to who is in the right and who is in the wrong, but 
deliver Your Judgment in such a manner that the followers of the Truth are saved 
and the followers of falsehood are completely annihilated from the earth.<br>
<br>87"Laden Ark", because the Ark became full with the believers and the pairs 
of animals from every species. For further details, see Hud: 40.<br><br>88For 
comparison, see Al-A'raf: 65-72, Hud: 50-60; and for further details of this 
story, see Ha Mim Sajdah: 13-16, Al-Ahqaf: 21-26, Az-Zariyat: 4145, Al-Qamar 
:18-22, Al-Haqqah: 4-8, and AI-Fajr: 6-8.<br><br>89In order to understand this 
discourse of Prophet Hud fully, we should keep in mind the various details about 
the people of `Ad which the Qur'an has given at different places: For instance, 
it says:<br><br>(1) After the destruction of the people of Noah, the `Ad were 
given power and prominence in the world: "Do not forget that after Noah's people 
your Lord made you the successors." (Al-A`raf: 69).<br><br>(2) Physically they 
were very robust and powerful people: " .... and made you very robust." (Al-A`raf: 
69).<br><br>(3)They had no parallel as a nation in the world: "The like of which 
was not created in the lands." (A1-Fajr: 8).<br><br>(4) They were civilized and 
were well-known in the world for their great skill and art in erecting lofty 
buildings with tall columns: "Have you not seen what your Lord did with `Ad lram, 
of lofty columns?" (Al-Fajr: 6, 7).<br><br>(5) This material progress and 
physical power had made them arrogant and vain: "As for `Ad, they deviated from 
the right path and adopted an arrogant attitude in the land and said, `who is 
mightier than we in power'?" (Ha Mim Sajdah: 15) .<br><br>(6) Their political 
power was in the hands of a few tyrants before whom none could dare raise his 
voice: "....and they followed and obeyed every tyrannous enemy of the Truth." (Hud: 
59) .<br><br>(7) They were not disbelievers in the existence of Allah, but were 
involved in shirk; they only denied that Allah alone should be worshiped and 
none else: "They said (to Hud), `Have you come to us (with the demand) that we 
should worship Allah alone and discard those whom our elders have been 
worshiping?" (Al-A`raf: 70).<br><br>90That is, "You build grand buildings merely 
to show off your wealth and power, whereas they have no use and purpose except 
that they stand as monuments to your grandeur and glory. " <br><br>91That is, 
,"Though you have built other buildings also for dwelling purposes, in order to 
make them grand, beautiful and strong, you expend your wealth and mental and 
physical abilities in a manner as if you were going to live for ever, and there 
was no purpose of life except seeking of comfort and pleasure and nothing beyond 
this worldly life which might deserve your attention."<br><br>In this 
connection, one should bear in mind the fact that extravagance in architecture 
is not a solitary vice in a people. This happens as a result of a people's 
becoming affluent and then crazy for selfish gains and materialistic pursuits. 
When a people reach such a stage, their whole social system becomes corrupted 
and polluted. Prophet Hud's criticism of his people's extravagant and luxurious 
architecture was not simply aimed at the high castles and monuments, but he was 
actually criticizing their corrupt civilization and social system, whose glaring 
symptoms could be seen everywhere in the land in the shape of castles and 
monuments. <br><br>92That is,"In order to meet the demands of your ever rising 
standards of life, you do not rest content with small living quarters but you 
build castles and fortresses, and yet being unsatisfied you erect lofty edifices 
unnecessarily just for ostentation. But as human beings you have become so 
depraved that there is no mercy in your hearts for the weak, no justice for the 
poor, and all people of lower social strata, living inside or around your land, 
are being oppressed tyrannically and none is safe from your barbarities." <br>
<br>93This can have two meanings: (1) "Whatever we are doing is not new but has 
been happening from the tune of our elders since centuries: they had the same 
creed, the same way of life, the same morality and the same kind of dealings and 
yet they remained unharmed and safe from every calamity. If there was any evil 
in this way of life, we should have met the doom with which you are threatening 
us." (2) "The things you are preaching have been preached and said before also 
by religious maniacs and so-called moralists, but they could not change the ways 
of the world. It has never happened that the world suffered a disaster only 
because people refused to listen to preachers like you." <br><br>94According to 
the Qur'an, the people of 'Ad were destroyed by a violent windstorm. When they 
saw it advancing towards their valleys, they rejoiced with the hope that those 
were dense clouds which would bring much rain for them, but in reality it was 
Allah's scourge. The windstorm continued to rage for eight days and seven nights 
and destroyed everything. The people were swept away like straw and everything 
on which the hot, dry wind blew was left rotting. The storm did not abate until 
the last man of the wicked tribe had met his doom. Only ruins of their 
habitations remained to tell the tale of their terrible fate, and today even the 
ruins have become extinct. The whole territory of Ahqaf has turned into dreadful 
desert dunes. For details, see E.N. 25 of AI-Ahqaf.<br><br>95For comparison, see 
Al-A'raf: 73-79, Hud: 61-68, AI-Hijr: 80-84, Bani Isra'il 59; and for further 
details, see An-Naml . 45-53, Az-Zariyat: 43-45, AI-Qamar: 23-31, AI-Haqqah: 
4-5, Al-Fajr: 9, and Ash-Shams: 11.<br><br>Thamud achieved power and glory after 
the destruction of 'Ad and as far as progress in civilization is concerned, they 
followed in the footsteps of their predecessors. In their case, too, the 
standards of living went on rising higher and higher and the standards of 
humanity continued to fall lower and lower, suffering one deterioration after 
the other. On the one hand, they erected large edifices on the plains and hewed 
beautiful houses out of the hills like those in the caves of Ellora and Ajanta 
in India, and on the other, they became addicted to idol-worship and the land 
was filled with tyranny and oppression. The worst men became leaders and rulers 
in the land. As such, Prophet Salih's message of Truth only appealed to the weak 
people belonging to the lower social strata and the people of the upper classes 
refused to believe in him.<br><br>96According to the Qur'an, the people of 
Prophet Salih themselves admitted that he was a man of great integrity and 
extraordinary caliber: "They said, 'O Salih, till now you were such a person 
among us of whom we had great expectations." (Hud: 62)<br><br>97That is, "Do you 
consider that your life of indulgence and pleasure is everlasting, and you will 
never be asked to account for Allah's favors to you and for your own misdeeds?"<br>
<br>98Hadim. heavy bunches of ripe, juicy and soft date-palm fruit hanging from 
trees<br><br>99Just as the most prominent feature of the 'Ad civilization was 
that they built large edifices with high pillars, so the most prominent feature 
of the Thamud civilization for which they were known among the ancient peoples 
was that they carved out dwellings in the hills. That is why in Surah Fajr, the 
`Ad have been referred to as "(people) of the illars", and the Thamud as "those 
who hewed rocks in the valley". These people also built castles on the plains, 
the purpose and object of which was nothing but display of wealth and power and 
architectural skill as there was no real necessity for them. These are, in fact, 
the ways of the perverted people: the poor among them do not have proper 
shelters, and the wealthy members not only have sufficient fine dwellings but 
over and above those they raise monuments for ostentation and display.<br><br>
Some of these Thamudic works exist even today, which I have seen in December, 
1959. (See pictures. This place is situated between AI-Madinah and Tabuk, a few 
miles to the north of Al-'Ula (Wad-il-Qura of the Holy Prophet's time) in Hejaz. 
The local inhabitants call it AI-Hijr and Mada'in Salih even today. AI-'Ula is 
still a green and fertile valley abounding in water springs and gardens, but AI-Hijr 
appears to be an abandoned place. It has thin population, little greenery and a 
few wells one of which is said to be the one at which Prophet Salih's shecamel 
used to drink water. This well is now dry and located within a deserted military 
post of the time of the Turks. When we entered this territory and approached 
AI-'Ula, we found hills which seemed to have been shattered to pieces from top 
to bottom as if by a violent earthquake. (See pictures on the opposite pages). 
We saw the same kind of hills while travelling to the east, from AI-`Ula to 
Khaibar, for about 50 miles, and towards the north inside Jordan, for about 30 
to 40 miles. This indicated that an area, stretching well over 300 to 400 miles 
in length and 100 miles in width, had been devastated by the terrible 
earthquake.<br><br>A few of the Thamudic type monuments that we saw at AI-Hijr 
were also found at Madyan along the Gulf of 'Aqabah and at Petra in Jordan. At 
Petra specially the Thamudic and Nabataean works stand side by side, and their 
styles and architectural designs are so different that anyone who examines them 
will find that they were neither built in the same age nor by the same nation. 
(See pictures for contrast). Doughty, the British orientalist, in his attempt to 
prove the Qur'an as false, has claimed that the works found at Al-HIijr were not 
carved out by Thamud but by the Nabataeans. I am of the view that the art of 
carving houses out of the rocks started with the Thamud, and thousands of years 
later, in the second and first centuries B.C., it was considerably developed by 
the Nabataeans and it reached perfection in the works of the caves of Ellora, 
which were carved out about 700 years after Petra. <br><br>100That is, "You 
should give up obedience to your chiefs, guides and rulers under whose 
leadership you are following an evil way of life. These people have transgressed 
all bounds of morality: they cannot bring about any reforms and they will 
corrupt every system of life that they adopt: The only way for you towards 
success and well-being is that you should inculcate fear of God, give up 
obedience to the misguides and obey me, because I am God's Messenger: you are 
fully aware of my honesty and integrity: I have no personal interest and motive 
for undertaking the work of reform. " This was in short the manifesto which 
Prophet Salih presented before his people: it not only contained the religious 
message but invitation to cultural, moral and political revolution as well. <br>
<br>101"Enchanted person": Mad and insane person who has lost reasoning power. 
According to the ancient conceptions, madness was either due to the influence of 
a jinn or magic. That is why a mad person was either called majnun (one under 
the influence of a jinn) or one enchanted by magic. <br><br>102That is, "We 
cannot believe you to be a Messenger from God because you are just like us and 
we see no distinction in you. However, if you are true in your claim that God 
has appointed you as His Messenger, you should present such a clear miracle as 
should make us believe that you have really been sent by the Creator and Master 
of the universe. <br><br>103From the context it appears that it was not a common 
she-camel, but it was brought about in a supernatural manner because it was 
presented in response to the demand for a miracle. Prophet Salih. could not have 
produced before the people an ordinary she-camel as a proof of his Prophethood 
because that would not have satisfied them. All other places in the Qur'an it 
has been clearly referred to as a miracle. In Surah Al-A`raf and Hud it has been 
said: "....here is Allah's she camel, a Sign for you." (VII: 73) In Surah Bani 
Isra'il the same thing has been stated more emphatically: "And nothing has 
hindered Us from sending Signs except that the former people refused to 
acknowledge them as such. (For example) We sent the she-camel as an open Sign to 
Thamud but they treated her with cruelty; whereas We send Signs only by way of 
warning." (v. 59) Moreover, the challenge given to the wicked people of Thamud, 
after presenting the she-camel before them, was such that it could only be given 
after presenting a miracle. <br><br>104That is, "One day the she-camel will 
drink water all alone at your wells and springs, and one day you and your 
animals will take water, and this arrangement will not be violated in any way." 
There could hardly be a greater challenge for the people of Arabia, for taking 
of water had been the foremost cause of feuds and fights among them, which 
mostly resulted in bloodshed, even loss of life. As such, the challenge given by 
Prophet Salih was indeed a challenge to the whole nation, which could not be 
acceptable unless the people were sure that the challenger had a great power at 
his back. But Prophet Salih threw this challenge all by himself without any 
worldly power behind him, and the whole nation not only received it quietly, but 
also abided by it submissively for quite some days.<br><br>In Surahs Al-A`raf 
and Hud there is an addition to this: "Here is Allah's she-camel, a Sign for 
you. So let her graze at will in Allah's land, and do not touch her with an evil 
intention." (XI: 64) That is, the challenge was not only this that the she-camel 
would drink water all alone every alternate day, but, in addition, she would 
freely move about and graze at will in their fields and gardens and palm groves 
and pastures and was not to be touched with an evil intention. <br><br>105This 
does not mean that as soon as they heard the challenge, they attacked the 
she-camel at once and hamstrung her. Actually, when the she-camel became a 
problem for the whole nation, the hearts of the people were filled with rage, 
and they began to hold lengthy consultations as to how to get rid of her. At 
last, a haughty chief undertook the task of putting an end to her, as mentioned 
in Surah Ash-Shams thus: "When arose the most villainous of the people.. ." (v. 
12) and in Surah Al-Qamarthus: "They appealed to their companion; so he took up 
the responsibility and hamstrung (her)." (v. 29).<br><br>106As stated at other 
places in the Qur'an, when the she-camel was killed, Prophet Salih declared: 
"You have only three more days to enjoy yourselves in your houses." (Hud: 65) 
When this time limit came to an end, a shocking explosion took place in the 
night at about dawn, followed by a violent earthquake, which destroyed the whole 
nation completely. In the morning their dead bodies lay scattered here and there 
like dry pieces of bush trampled down by animals around an enclosure. Neither 
their stony castles nor their rock-hewn caves could protect them against the 
calamity. "We sent against them a single blast and they became as the trampled 
twigs of the fence of a fold-builder." (Al-Qamar: 31). "Consequently a shocking 
catastrophe overtook them and they lay lifeless in their dwellings" (Al-A'raf: 
78). "At last a violent blast overtook them with the approach of the morning, 
and all that they had achieved proved of no avail to them." (Al Hijr: 83, 84).<br>
<br>107For comparison, see Al-A'raf: 80-84, Hud: 7483. AI-Hijr: 57-77, AI-Anbiya': 
71-75, An-Naml; 54-58, Al-'Ankabut: 28-35, As-Saffat: 133-138 and A I-Qamar: 
33-39. <br><br>108This can have two meanings: (1) Of all the creatures you have 
chosen males only for the purpose of gratifying your sex desires, whereas there 
are plenty of women in the world; and (2) You alone are the people in the whole 
world, who go to men to satisfy the sex desires; even the animals do not resort 
to this. This second meaning has been explained in Surahs Al-A'raf and Al- 'Ankabut 
thus: "Have you become so shameless that you commit such indecent acts as no one 
committed before you in the world?" (Al-A'raf: 80).<br><br>109This can also have 
two meanings: (1 ) "You leave your wives whom God has created for you to satisfy 
your sex desire and adopt unnatural ways with the males for the purpose." (2) 
"Even with respect to your wives you do not follow the natural way but adopt 
unnatural ways for the gratification of your lust?" This they might have been 
doing with the intention of family planning. <br><br>110That is, "This is not 
the only vice in-you; your whole lives have become corrupted and perverted, as 
stated in An-Naml: 54 thus : "Do you commit indecent acts openly and publicly?" 
And 'in Al-'Ankabut: 29 thus: "Have you become so perverted that you gratify 
your lust with the males, you rob travelers, and you commit wicked deeds 
publicly in your assemblies?" For further details, see E.N. 39 of AI-Hijr. <br>
<br>111That is, "You know that whosoever has spoken against us, or protested 
against our doings, or opposed us in any way, he has been turned out of our 
habitations. If you also behave like that, you too will be treated likewise." It 
has been stated in Surahs AI-A`raf and An-Naml that before giving this warning 
to Prophet Lot, the wicked people had decided to "turn out these people of your 
habitations for they pose to be very pious." (VII: 82) <br><br>112This may also 
mean: "My Lord, deliver us from the evil consequences of their misdeeds," and 
also this: "Protect the children of the believers from the evil effects of the 
immoral acts of the wicked people."<br><br>113This refers to the Prophet Lot`s 
wife as stated in verse 10 of Surah Tahrim about the wives of Prophets Noah and 
Lot: "These two women were in the houses of Our two pious servants but they 
acted treacherously towards them." That is, they did not believe, and sided with 
the unbelievers instead of their righteous husbands. Therefore, when Allah 
decreed to send a torment on the people of Lot, He commanded Lot to leave the 
place along with his people but to leave his wife behind: "So depart from here 
with the people of your household in the last hours of the night. And look here: 
none of you should turn round to look behind; but your wife (who will not 
accompany you) shall meet the same doom as they." (Hud: 81). <br><br>114This was 
not a rain of water but a rain of stones. According to the details given at 
other places in the Qur'an, when Prophet Lot had left the place along with the 
people of his household in the last hours of the night, there occurred a 
terrible explosion at dawn and a violent earthquake, which turned all their 
habitations upside down and rained on them stones of baked clay as a result of a 
volcanic eruption and a strong blast of wind.<br><br>Below we give a resume of 
the Biblical account and of ancient Greek and Latin writings and modern 
geological researches and archaeological observations about the torment and the 
place where it occurred:<br><br>The, hundreds of ruins found in the waste and 
uninhabited land lying to the south and east of the Dead Sea indicate that this 
must have been a prosperous and thickly populated area in the past. The 
archaeologists have estimated that the age of prosperity of this land lasted 
between 2300 and 1900 B.C. According to historians, Prophet Abraham lived about 
2000 B C. Thus the archaeological evidence confirms that this land was destroyed 
in the time of Prophet Abraham and his nephew Prophet Lot.<br><br>The most 
populous and fertile part .of the area was "the vale of Siddim" as mentioned in 
the Bible: "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that 
it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, 
even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt" (Gen. 13 :10) The 
present day scholars are of the opinion that that valley is now under the Dead 
Sea and this opinion is supported by firm archaeological evidence. In the 
ancient times, the Dead Sea did not so much extend to the south as it does 
today. Opposite and to the west of the present Jordanian city of AI-Karak, there 
is a small peninsula called AI-Lisan. This was the end of the sea in ancient 
days. The area to the south of it, which is now under sea water (the shaded 
portion in the map) was a fertile valley, "the vale of Siddim", in which were 
situated Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, Zoar, the famous cities of the people 
of Lot. In about 2000 B.C. this valley sank as a result of a violent earthquake 
and was submerged in sea water. Even today this is the most shallow part of the 
Sea. In the Roman period it was more so and was fordable from AI-Lisan to the 
western coast. One can still see submerged jungles along the southern coast and 
there might as well be submerged buildings.<br><br>According to the Bible and 
the ancient Greek and Latin writings, the region abounded in pits of petroleum 
and asphalt and at places inflammable gas also existed. It appears from the 
geological observations that with the violent earthquake shocks, petroleum, 
gases and asphalt were thrown up and ignited, and the whole region exploded like 
a bomb. The Bible says that when Prophet Abraham got the news and went from 
Hebron to see the affected valley, he saw that "the smoke of the country went up 
as the smoke of a furnace." (Gen. 19: 28).<br><br>115The people of Aiykah have 
been briefly mentioned in vv. 78-84 of Surah AI-Hijr. More about them here. 
There is a difference of opinion among the commentators as to whether the 
Midianites and the people of Aiykah were two different tribes or one and the 
same people. One group holds that they were different tribes and gives the 
argument that in Surah Al-A'raf Prophet Shu'aib has been "brother of the 
Midianites" (v. RS), whereas here, with regard to the people of. Aiykah, he has 
not been called so. The other group holds that they were one and the same people 
on the ground that the moral discases and characteristics mentioned of the 
Midianites in SurahS AI-A'raf-and Hud are the same as of the people of Aiykah 
mentioned here. Then the message and admonition of Prophet Shu'aib to both the 
tribes was the same, and the two tribes also met the same end.<br><br>Research 
in this regard has shown that both the views are correct. The Midianites and the 
people' of Aiykah were doubtless two different tribes but branches of the same 
stock. The progeny of Prophet Abraham from his wife (or slave girl) Keturah, is 
well known in Arabia and in the history of the Israelites as the children of 
Keturah. Their most prominent branch was the one which became famous as the 
Midianites, after their ancestor, Midian, son of Abraham. They had settled in 
the territory between northern Arabia and southern Palestine, and along the 
coasts of the Red Sea and the Gulf of 'Aqabah. Their capital city was Madyan, 
which was situated, according to Abul Fida, on the western coast of the Gulf of 
'Aqabah at five days' journey from Aiykah (present-day 'Aqabah). The rest of the 
children of Keturah, among whom the Dedanites are comparatively better known, 
settled in the territory between Taima and Tabuk and AI-'Ula in northern Arabia, 
their main city being Tabuk, the Aiykah of the ancient tithes. (Yaqut in his 
Mu'jam al-Buldan, under Aiykah, writes that this is the old name of Tabuk, and 
the natives of Tabuk confirm this).<br><br>The reason why one and the same 
Prophet was sent to the Midianites and the people of Aiykah was probably that 
both the tribes were descendants of the same ancestors, spoke the same language 
and had settled in the adjoining areas. It is just possible that they lived side 
by side in the same areas and had marriage and other social relations between 
them. Then, these two branches were traders by profession and had developed 
similar evil practices and social and moral weaknesses. According to the early 
books of the Bible, these people worshiped Baal-peor. When the Children of 
Israel came out of Egypt and entered their territory, they also became infected 
with the evils of idolatry and adultery. (Numbers, 25: 1-5, 31: 16-17). Then 
those people had settled on the two main international trade routes, the one 
joining Yaman with Syria and the other the Persian Gulf with Egypt. Due to their 
advantageous position they had started big scale highway robbery and would not 
let any caravan pass till it had paid heavy taxes. They had thus rendered these 
trade routes highly unsafe. Their characteristic of highway robbery has been 
mentioned in the Qur'an, for which they were admonished through Prophet Shu'aib, 
thus: "And do not lie in ambush by every path (of life) as robbers in order to 
frighten the people" (AI-A'raf: 86). These were the reasons why Allah sent to 
both the tribes the same Prophet, who conveyed to them the same teachings and 
message. For the details of the story of Prophet Shu'aib and the Midianites, see 
A1-A'raf: 85-93, Hud: 8495, Al'Ankabut 36-37.<br><br>116That is, "It is not in 
my power to bring down the torment; it is in Allah's power, and He is fully 
aware of your misdeeds. He will send down the torment as and when He wills." In 
this demand of the people of Aiykah and the answer of Prophet Shu'aib to them 
there was an admonition for the Quraish as well. They also demanded from the 
Holy Prophet to bring down the torment on them: "Or.... you cause the sky to 
fall down on us in fragments, as you threaten us." (Bani Isra'il: 92). As such 
the Quraish are being told that the people of Aiykah had also demanded a similar 
thing from their Prophet, and the answer that they got from their Prophet is the 
answer of Muhammad (Allah's peace be on him) to you.<br><br>117The details of 
this torment are neither found in the Qur'an nor in any authentic Tradition. 
What one can learn from the Text is this: As these people had demanded a torment 
from the sky. Allah sent upon them a cloud which hung over them like a canopy 
and kept hanging until they were completely destroyed by the torment of 
continuous rain. The Qur'an clearly points out that the nature of the torment 
sent upon the Midianites was different from that sent upon the people of Aiykah 
The people of Aiykah, as mentioned here, were destroyed by the torment of the 
Canopy, while the torment visiting the Midianites was in the form of a terrible 
earthquake: "It so happened that a shocking catastrophe overtook them and they 
remained lying prostrate in their dwellings." (Al-A'raf: 91). And: "A dreadful 
shuck overtook them and they lay lifeless and prostrate in their homes." (Hud: 
94). Therefore, it is wrong to regard the two torments as identical. Some 
commentators have given a few explanations of "the torment of the Day of 
Canopy", but we do not know the source of their information. Ibn Jarir has 
quoted Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas as saying: "If somebody from among the 
scholars gives you an explanation of the torment of the Day of Canopy, do not 
consider it as correct."<br><br>118At the end of the historical account, the 
same theme, with which the Surah began, is resumed. For reference, see vv. 1-9.
<br><br>119That is, "This lucid Book whose verses are being recited to you, and 
this 'Admonition' from which the people are turning away, is not the product of 
the whims of a man; it has not been written and compiled by Muhammad (upon whom 
be Allah's peace) himself, but it consists of the Revelations of the Lord of 
this universe."<br><br>120That is, Angel Gabriel, as mentioned in Al-Baqarah: 
97: "Say to them, `Whoever is the enemy to Gabriel, he should understand that he 
has, by Allah's Command, revealed to your heart the Qur'an'." Here the object of 
using the title of "the trustworthy Spirit" for Gabriel implies that the Qur`an 
is not being sent down by Allah through some material agency, which is subject 
to change and vacillation; but through a pure Spirit, having no tinge of 
materialism, and. who is perfectly trustworthy. This Spirit conveys the Messages 
of Allah precisely in the same form and with the same content as they are 
entrusted to him: it is not possible for him to tamper with the Messages, or to 
make his own additions to them in any way.<br><br>121This sentence may be 
related to: "... the trustworthy Spirit has come down" and also to: ".... who 
are (appointed by God) to warn. "In the first case, it will mean that the 
trustworthy Spirit has brought it down in plain Arabic language, and in the 
second case, it will mean that the Holy Prophet is included among those Prophets 
who were appointed to warn the people in the Arabic language, i.e., Hud, Salih, 
Ishmael and Shu'aib (Allah's peace be upon them). In both cases the object is 
the same: the Divine Message has not been sent down in a dead or mysterious 
language, or in a language of riddles and enigmas, but in such clear and lucid 
Arabic, which can be understood easily by every Arab and every nonArab who has 
learnt Arabic. As such, the people who are turning away from it, cannot have the 
excuse that they could not understand the message of the Qur'an. The only reason 
of their denial and aversion is that they are afflicted with the same disease 
with which Pharaoh, the people of Abraham the people of Noah, the people of Lot, 
the 'Ad and the Thamud, and the people of Aiykah were afflicted. <br><br>122That 
is, this very Admonition and Divine Message and teachings are contained in the 
former Scriptures also. The same message of submission to One God, the same 
belief in the Hereafter and the same invitation to follow the Prophets has been 
given in all those Books. AII the Books sent down by God condemn shirk and the 
materialistic philosophy of life and invite people to accept the true and sound 
philosophy of life, which is based on the concept of man's accountability before 
God, and demands that man should give up his independence in deference to Divine 
Commands brought and preached by the Prophets. None of these things is new, 
which the Qur'an may be presenting for the first time, and none can blame the 
Holy Prophet of saying something which had never been said before by the former 
Prophets.<br><br>Among other arguments this verse also is quoted in support of 
Imam Abu Hanifah's early opinion that if a person recites the translation of the 
Qur'an in the prayer, his prayer will be in order and valid, whether he is able 
to recite the Qur'an in Arabic or not. According to `Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas, 
the basis of this argument is: "Allah says that the Qur'an was contained in the 
former Scriptures also; obviously this could not be in Arabic words, As such, if 
translated and presented in another language, it will still be the Qur'an." (Ahkam-ul-Qur'an, 
Vol. III, p. 429). But the weakness of this argument is obvious. The Qur'an, or 
any other Divine Book, was never revealed in a manner that Allah inspired the 
Prophet with its meaning and then he presented it before the people in his own 
words. The fact is that every Book, in whatever language it came, was revealed 
in Divine words and meanings together. As such, the teachings of the Qur'an were 
contained in the former Scriptures in Divine words and not in human, and none of 
their translations could be considered as the Divine Book or its representation. 
As regards the Qur'an, it has been stated over and over again that it was 
literally revealed in the Arabic language: "We have sent it down as Qur'an in 
Arabic". (Yusuf: 2). "We have sent this Command in Arabic to you." (Ar-Ra'd: 
37). "An Arabic Qur'an without any crookedness." (Az-Zumar: 28). Then just 
before this verse, it has been said that the trustworthy Spirit has brought it 
down in Arabic. Now how can it be said that the translation of the Qur'an made 
into another language will also be the Qur'an and its words will represent the 
words of Allah? It appears that later the Imam himself felt this weakness in the 
argument and, according to authentic traditions, gave up his earlier opinion, 
and adopted the opinion of Imams Abu Yusuf and Muhammad, who held that a person 
who could not recite Arabic words, could recite the translation of the Qur'an in 
his prayer till he was able to pronounce Arabic words. However, the prayer of a 
person, who was able to recite the Qur'an in Arabic, would not be valid if he 
recited its translation. The fact is that the two Imams had proposed, this 
concession only for those non-Arab converts who were not able to offer their 
prayer in Arabic immediately after embracing Islam. In this the basis of their 
argument was not that the translation of the Qur'an was the Qur'an itself, but 
that just as a person unable to perform Ruku' and Sajdah was allowed to offer 
his prayer by making signs, so a person unable to pronounce Arabic words could 
recite the translation. Then just as the prayer of a person who offered it by 
making signs could not be valid as soon as the cause of inability was removed, 
so the prayer of a person who recited the translation would not be valid as soon 
as he became able to pronounce Arabic words. (For a detailed discussion, see Al-Mabsut 
by Sarkhasi,Vol. I, p. 37; Fath ul-Qadir and Sharh Inaya 'alal-Hedaya, Vol. I. 
pp. 190-201). <br><br>123That is, "The learned men of the Israelites know that 
the teachings of the Qur'an are the same as of the former Scriptures. Though the 
people of Makkah themselves are un-initiated in the knowledge of the Book, there 
are many scholars among the Israelites living in the surrounding areas, who 
fully understand that the Qur'an did not bring a novel "message", which was 
being presented by Muhammad bin `Abdullah for the first time, but it was the 
same message which had been brought and preached by Prophets of Allah one after 
the other since thousands of years. Is it not then a convincing proof of the 
fact that the Qur'an has been sent down by the same Lord of the universe, Who 
sent down the former Books ?" '<br><br>According to Ibn Hisham's Life of the 
Holy Prophet, a little before the revelation of these verses a deputation of 20 
men, who had been influenced by the preaching of Hadrat Ja'far, came to Makkah 
from Habash. They met the Holy Prophet in Masjid al-Haram and asked him in the 
presence of the unbelieving Quraish what his teachings were. In response, the 
Holy Prophet recited a few verses of the Qur'an, whereupon tears came down from 
their eyes and they believed in him there and then to be a true Messenger of 
Allah. When they took leave of the Holy Prophet, Abu Jahl met them along with a 
few other men of the Quraish and rebuked them, saying, "Never has a more stupid 
company come here before: O foolish men, you were sent here by your people with 
a view to inquiring about this man, but no sooner did you meet him than you gave 
up your own faith!" "those gentle people did not like to have a dispute with Abu 
Jahl, so they left him, saying, "We have no wish to enter an argument with you: 
you are responsible for your faith and we are for ours: we adopted something in 
which we saw some good for ourselves." (Vol II, p. 32). This same incident has 
been mentioned in Surah Qasas, thus:"Those to whom We had given the Book before 
this, believe in the Qur'an and when it is recited to them, they say, 'We have 
believed in it: this is the very Truth from our Lord: we were even before this 
followers of Islam'. And when they heard vain and meaningless talk, they 
refrained from entering an argument, saying, `For us are our deeds and for you 
yours: peace be to you: we do not like the ways of the ignorant!"' (vv. 52-55).
<br><br>124That is, "Now when a man from among themselves is reciting to them 
this Divine Revelation in lucid Arabic, they say that he himself has composed 
it, and therefore it cannot be from Allah. But if the same Revelation in 
eloquent Arabic had been sent down by Allah to a non-Arab as a miracle, and he 
had recited it before them in perfect Arabic accent, they would have invented 
some other excuse for not believing in him. They would have said that he is 
under the power and influence of a jinn, who speaks Arabic through a non-Arab." 
As a matter of fact, a lover of the truth considers the thing presented before 
him coolly and forms an opinion about it after due thought. But an obdurate 
person who is unwilling to believe, pays no attention to it at all, but instead 
seeks all sorts of excuses to reject it, and will, in any case, invent an excuse 
for his denial. This obduracy of the unbelieving Quraish has been exposed over 
and over again in the Qur'an, and they have been clearly told that even if a 
miracle were shown to them, they would certainly have found an excuse to deny it 
because they are not inclined to believe: "O Messenger, even if We had sent down 
to you a Book written on paper, and even if they had touched it with their own 
hands, the disbelievers would have said, `This is nothing but manifest 
sorcery'." (Al-An`am: 7). "Even if We had opened a gate for them in heaven, and 
they had begun to ascend through it, they would have said, `Our eyes have been 
dazzled; nay, we have been bewitched'" (Al-Hijr: 1415). <br><br>125That is, 
unlike the truth-loving people to whom the Qur'an brings peace of the mind and 
heart, it passes like a hot iron rod through the hearts of the disbelievers, 
which sets them ill at ease, and they, instead of pondering over its themes, 
start looking for subterfuges to deny it.<br><br>126The kind of torment with 
which the tribes and communities mentioned above were punished. <br><br>127That 
is, "Until the criminals are actually overtaken by the torment, they do not 
believe in the Prophet. Then they feel remorse and desire to be given some 
respite when it is too late.<br><br>128There is a subtle gap between this and 
the preceding sentence, which the reader himself can fill with a little 
thinking. They were asking for the torment to be hastened because they were not 
sure that it would ever come. They were confident that they would continue 
living a life of ease and indulgence as they had been living till then. On 
account of the same confidence they challenged the Holy Prophet, as if to say, 
"If you are a Messenger of Allah, and we deserve to be chastised by Allah 
because we have treated you as a liar, then you should hasten that torment on 
us, with which you threaten us." At this it is being said, "Well, even if they 
be right in their confidence, and the torment is not sent upon them immediately, 
and they are allowed a long respite to enjoy life as they expect, the question 
is: What will these few years of worldly pleasure and comfort avail them when 
the inevitable scourge from Allah overtakes them suddenly as it overtook the 'Ad 
and the Thamud, or the people of Lot and of Aiykah, or if they are visited by 
death which nobody can escape?<br><br>129That is, "We could not be blamed for 
any injustice when they did not heed the warning and admonition of the warners 
and were destroyed. It would have been injustice if no effort had been made to 
admonish them and guide them aright prior to their destruction."<br><br>130After 
the positive aspect as stated in vv. 192-193, the negative aspect is being 
stated that the Qur'an has not been brought down by satans as the enemies of the 
Truth allege. The unbelieving Quraish in their campaign to spread lies and 
slander against the Holy Prophet were facing a real difficulty. They did not 
know how to account for the wonderful discourses which were being presented 
before the people in the form of the Qur'an and which were moving their hearts 
deeply. They could not stop the Qur'an from reaching the people. The only thing 
they could do to counteract its effect and influence was to create doubts and 
suspicions about it in their minds and hearts. Therefore, in their desperation 
they charged that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was a sorcerer, who was 
being inspired by the satans, and they considered this charge of theirs to be 
the most effective because it could neither be easily verified nor refuted.<br>
<br>131That is, these revelations and themes do not at all suit the satans. Any 
person who has a little common sense can well understand that the sublime 
discourses being presented in the Qur'an cannot be inspired by the satans. Never 
has it happened that the satans might have taught the people through the 
sorcerers to worship God and fear Him, or forbidden them from shirk and 
idol-worship, or warned them of the accountability of the Hereafter, or 
prohibited them from tyranny and sexual and moral evils, and exhorted them 
instead to act righteously and do good to others. Such works cannot behoove the 
satans. Their only pastime can be to sow the seeds of discord among the people 
and to arouse them to mischief and vice. The common observation is that people 
visit the sorcerers to find out whether they will succeed in their love affairs 
or not, what move would suit them in gambling, what trick and stratagem would be 
helpful against the enemy, or who had stolen the camel of so and so. Apart from 
such affairs and problems, the sorcerers and their patron-saints cannot be 
expected to worry themselves about matters like reforming the people, teaching 
them morals and cleansing their lives of vice and evil.<br><br>132That is, even 
if the satans wanted they could not impart Truth and Goodness to the people like 
a true teacher and reformer as the Qur'an does. Even if to deceive the people, 
they came out under the guise of a benefactor, their work would not be tree from 
blemishes, which would betray their ignorance and their hidden satanic nature. 
Similarly the life and the teachings of a person who poses to be a religious 
guide, under the influence and inspiration of satans, would inevitably reflect 
the wickedness of intention and design. Thus the satans can neither inspire 
others with piety and goodness, nor can those, who have any relation with the 
satans, become pious and righteous themselves. Then in addition to its high and 
noble teachings, the Qur'an is a lucid and eloquent Book, which contains the 
knowledge of Reality. That is why it has over and over again put forward the 
challenge that human beings and jinns would never be able to produce a book like 
the Qur'an even if they collaborated with all their energies and capacities. 
"Declare this: Even if human beings and jinns should cooperate with one another 
to bring forth a book like the Qur'an, they will never be able to bring anything 
like it, even though all of them help one another" (Bani Isra'il: 88).<br><br>
"Tell them: if what you say be true, then produce one Surah like this, and you 
may call to your assistance anyone you can other than Allah." (Yunus: 38). <br>
<br>133That is, "Not to speak of interfering with the revelation of the Qur'an, 
the satans are not even given a chance to hear the Qur'an any moment from the 
time Angel Gabriel receives it from Allah till he reveals it to the heart of the 
Holy Prophet. They are so kept out of its hearing that they cannot get any hint 
as to its words and contents so as to tell their friends that the Holy Prophet 
was going to give such and such a message to his followers, or that his address 
would contain such and such a thing that day. For further details see E. N.'s 8 
to 12 of Al-Hijr, E.N.'s 5 to 7 of As -Saffat and Surah Jinn: 8-9-27.<br><br>
134This does not mean that the Holy Prophet was going to be involved in shirk 
from which he was to be admonished to desist. The object was to warn the 
disbelievers and polytheists to the effect: "As the message of the Qur'an is 
based on pure Truth revealed by the Almighty Ruler of the universe, and there is 
no tinge of any satanic impurity in it, there could be no question of showing a 
favor to somebody in regard to the Truth. Even if the Holy Messenger himself, 
who is nearest to Allah and His most beloved servant, deviated a little from the 
path of His obedience and invoked any other deity than Allah, he could not 
escape the punishment." When it was so in the case of the Holy Prophet, who else 
could have the hope that after committing shirk with regard to Allah, he would 
be able to escape the punishment or help others to escape it.<br><br>135Just as 
there could be no concession or favor for the person of the Prophet in a matter 
concerning Allah's religion, so there could be no question of a favor being 
shown to the Prophet's family or his nearest kinsfolk. Here the case of 
everybody will be judged on merit, and nobody will be shown any favor on account 
of his ancestry or relation with somebody else. The accountability of the 
Hereafter and punishment for deviation and misdeeds are the same for everybody 
and even the Prophet's nearest kinsfolk are no exception. Therefore, the Holy 
Prophet was commanded to warn his relatives and kindred to attain the right 
belief and to act righteously because they would not escape punishment only by 
virtue of being his relations.<br><br>There are authentic Traditions to show 
that after the revelation of this verse, the Holy Prophet first of all addressed 
the sons and daughters of his grandfather. Calling each one of them by name, he 
said: "O children of 'Abdul Muttalib, O 'Abbas, O Safiah, paternal aunt of 
Allah's Messenger, O Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad! You are warned to beware and 
save yourselves from the torment of the Hell-Fire: I cannot protect you from 
Allah's punishment; you may, however, demand whatever you like from my worldly 
property." Then as was the custom in Arabia, to warn the people of an impending 
calamity, he stood on top of Mount Safa one morning and called out: "O people of 
Quraish, O children of Ka`b bin Luayy, O children of Murrah, O children of 
Qasayy, O children of 'Abd Manaf, O children of 'Abd Shams, O children of Hashim, 
O children of `Abdul Muttalib....", and in this way he called out each branch 
and clan of the Quraish by name. When all the people had got together, he said, 
"O People, if 1 tell you that on the other side of this hill, there is a huge 
army ready to attack you, will you believe my word?" With one voice they replied 
in the affirmative, saying that they had never heard a lie from him in the past. 
Thereupon the Holy Prophet said, "Well, I warn you of the impending scourge of 
Allah: save yourselves from His punishment: I cannot be of any help to you 
against Him. On the Day of Resurrection, the righteous only will be nearest to 
me. Let it not happen that others should corm forth with good deeds and you 
should appear with the burden of sins on your heads. Then you will call me for 
help, but I shall be constrained to turn my face away from you. Of course, here 
in this world, I am bound to you by blood relations, and I shall treat you with 
all possible politeness as a good relation should." (Several Traditions on this 
subject have been reported in Bukhari, Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, Tirmizi, Ibn Jarir 
on the authority of Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 
'Abbas, Hadrat Zubair bin 'Amr and Hadrat Qabisah bin Makhariq).<br><br>The 
matter was not simply this that on receipt of the Command to "warn your nearest 
kinsfolk", the Holy Prophet called together all his relatives and complied with 
it. In fact, the principle it meant to stress was that in the matter of religion 
the Prophet and his relations enjoyed no special privilege of which the other 
people might be deprived. What was harmful for one man, was harmful for 
everybody. The Prophet was supposed to first protect himself from this and then 
warn his nearest kinsfolk and the common people of its fatal consequences. On 
the other hand, what was good and beneficial for one man, 'was good and 
beneficial for all. As. such, the Prophet should first adopt it himself and then 
exhort his relatives also to adopt it, so that everybody may see that the 
Prophet dces not only preach his message to others but practices it himself also 
sincerely. The Holy Prophet followed this principle throughout his life. On the 
conquest of Makkah, when he entered the city, he declared: "Every kind of 
interest payable from the people during the age of ignorance, is trampled under 
my feet, and first of all, I remit the interest payable to my uncle `Abbas." (It 
should be noted that before the prohibition of interest, Hadrat 'Abbas traded 
money on interest, and a substantial amount of interest payable to him at that 
time was outstanding against the people). Once the Holy Prophet ordered cutting 
off of the hand of a Quraishite woman, named Fatimah, on the charge of theft. 
Hadrat Usamah bin Zaid came to intercede for her, whereupon the Holy Prophet 
said: "By God, even if Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad, had committed the theft, I 
would have ordered amputation of her hand, too."<br><br>136This can have two 
meanings:<br><br>(1) "Treat those of your relatives with kindness, who have 
believed in you and followed your teachings practically; as for those who have 
not accepted your message, you may declare that you are not responsible for what 
they do."<br><br>(2) "You should treat with kindness every such person, who 
believes in and obeys you, and you should warn every unbeliever that you take no 
responsibility for his actions."<br><br>This verse shows that at that tune there 
were some people among the Quraish and the neighboring Arabs, who had believed 
in the truth of the Holy Prophet's message; but they had not as yet started 
obeying his teachings practically. They were still, as usual, living the same 
life of unbelief among their people as were the other unbelievers. Allah set 
apart such believers from those true believers who after belief had adopted 
total obedience of the Holy Prophet. The Command "to treat with kindness" was 
meant only for the latter group. As for those who had turned away from his 
obedience, and who included both those who believed in the truth of his message 
and those who rejected it, the Holy Prophet was instructed to disown them, and 
tell them plainly that they themselves were responsible for their deeds, and 
that after giving them the warning he was not at all responsible for what they 
did. <br><br>137That is, "You should not care at all for any worldly power, 
howsoever big and strong, but should continue to perform your mission with 
complete trust in that Being Who is Mighty as well as Merciful. He is Mighty 
and, therefore, anybody enjoying His support, cannot be overcome by any other 
power; He is Merciful and, therefore, He will not let go waste the sacrifices 
and efforts of the one who struggles for the sake of raising His Word in the 
world.<br><br>138"Getting up" may mean getting up for the Prayers during the 
night, or coming out for the purpose of performing the Prophetic Mission. <br>
<br>139This can have several meanings:<br><br>(1) Allah watches you when in the 
congregational Prayers you stand and sit and perform Ruku' and Sajdah with your 
followers behind you.<br><br>(2) He watches you when you get up in the night to 
see what your Companions (whose mark of distinction is that "they prostrate 
themselves in worship") are doing for their own well-being in the Hereafter.<br>
<br>(3) He is fully aware of how you and your Companions are endeavoring to 
reform the people.<br><br>(4) He is fully aware of all your efforts to 
revolutionize the lives of the people who "prostrate themselves in worship"; He 
knows what sort of training you are giving them to reform them; how you have 
purified their lives and transformed them into the best people.<br><br>These 
characteristics of the Holy Prophet and his Companions have a special 
significance in the context here. In the first place, the Holy Prophet deserves 
Allah's Mercy and His Support for Allah, being All-Hearing and All-Knowing, is 
fully aware of the struggle he is waging for His cause and of the efforts he is 
making to reform his Companions. Secondly, when a person is living such a noble 
life as Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) is actually living, 
and the characteristics of his followers are those which Muhammad's Companions 
have, only an idiot can have the boldness to say that he is inspired by the 
satans, or that he is a poet. People are fully aware of the lives of the 
sorcerers who are inspired by the satans and also of the poets and their 
admirers living among them. Can anybody honestly say that there is no difference 
whatever between the noble life being led by Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's 
peace) and his Companions and the sort of life being led by the poets and the 
sorcerers? Then, what is it if not sheer impudence that the former are openly 
being branded as poets and sorcerers without any shame?<br><br>140This implies 
the sorcerers, astrologers, fortune-tellers and conjurers who pose as knowers of 
the unseen and tell the people their future, or as wise men who have control 
over jinns and spirits and can make the destinies of the people through them.
<br><br>141This may have two meanings: (1) The satans somehow get a little hint 
of the truth and inspire their agents with it, mixing it with all kinds of 
falsehood; and (2) the deceitful, unscrupulous sorcerers hear something from the 
satans and then mixing it with falsehood, whisper it into the people's ears. 
This has been explained in a Tradition which Bukhari has quoted on the authority 
of Hadrat 'A'ishah. She says that when some people asked the Holy Prophet about 
sorcerers, he replied that they were nothing. They said, "O Messenger of Allah, 
they, sometimes, tell the right thing" The Holy Prophet answered, "That right 
thing is overheard by the jinns who whisper it into their friend's ear, who 
concocts a story by mixing a lot of falsehood in it." <br><br>142That is, the 
people who follow and accompany the poets, are wholly different in, their 
characteristics, habits and temper from those who follow and accompany Muhammad 
(upon whom be Allah's peace). The difference between the two groups is so 
obvious that one group can be easily distinguished from the other. On the one 
side, there are the people who are characterized by the high seriousness, 
civilized and gentle behavior, righteousness and fear of God, sense of 
responsibility and a high regard for the rights of others; people who are fair 
and just in their dealings, . who do not utter a word except in the cause of 
goodness, who have a high and pure ideal before them, which they pursue with 
single-minded devotion and for whose attainment they expend all their energies 
and capabilities. On other side, there are the people whose only pastime is to 
portray erotic scenes of love and wine-drinking, mocking and jesting, satirizing 
and eulogizing, or to arouse feelings of hatred and enmity and vengeance against 
others, or to describe charms of unchaste women to the brothel or of chaste 
ladies in the houses, only for the sake of pleasing the people and winning their 
applause. From the crowds who throng the poetic sessions and follow the "famous" 
poets, one cannot help forming the impression that those people are free from 
every moral restriction, who have no object in life except to gratify the lusts 
of the flesh like animals, and who have no idea whatever of the higher and 
nobler ideals and ends of life. The person who cannot see the obvious difference 
between the two types is indeed blind. But if in spite of seeing and knowing the 
difference, only for the purpose of suppressing the Truth, he says that Muhammad 
(upon whom be Allah's peace) and his Companions are no different from the poets 
and their followers, he is not only a liar but has also transgressed all bounds 
of modesty and decency.<br><br>143That is, they follow no fixed pattern for 
their thought and speech. but wander aimlessly in every valley. Every new 
impulse makes them take up a new theme regardless as to whether it has any truth 
in it or not. Under one momentary impulse they would start uttering wise things; 
under another they would give expression to filthy and base feelings. If they 
felt pleased with somebody, they would exaggerate his praises, and if they felt 
offended by him, they would condemn him and run him down to hell. If they had a 
selfish motive, attached with somebody, they would feel no hesitation in giving 
preference to a miserly person over a generous person and to a cowardly person 
over a gallant person. On the contrary, if they felt displeased with somebody, 
they would not feel any shame in blotting his character and ridiculing him and 
his ancestors. That is why, one can tied God-worship and atheism, materialism 
and spiritualism, morality and immorality, piety and filthiness, seriousness and 
jesting, eulogy and satire expressed side by side in the poetry of one and the 
same poet. A person who is aware of these well known characteristics of the 
poets cannot reconcile himself to charging the recipient of the Qur'an with 
poetry, whose every discourse and word is clear and precise, whose objective is 
clearly defined, and who has never in his life uttered a word deviating in any 
way from the path of truth, righteousness and virtue.<br><br>At another place in 
the Qur'an, it has been stated that poetry is not suited to the temperament of 
the Holy Prophet: "We have not taught him poetry, nor does it suit him." (Ya 
Sin: 69). And this fact was fully known to the people who had any personal 
acquaintance with the Holy Prophet. Authentic Traditions show that he could not 
recite a complete verse from memory. If ever during conversation he remembered 
of a good verse of some poet, he would recite it without much care and regard 
for its meter and order of words.<br><br>Once Hadrat `A'ishah was asked whether 
the Holy Prophet ever made use of poetic verses in his discourses. She replied 
that he hated poetic verses the most, though sometimes he would recite a verse 
of a poet of Bani Quais, but in so doing he would unconsciously change the order 
of its words. When Hadrat Abu Bakr corrected him, he would say, "Brother, I am 
not a poet, nor composing poetry is my object. " Arabic poetry abounded in 
themes of sex and love romances, wine drinking, tribal hatreds and feuds, 
ancestry pride and vanity and made little or no mention of pure and noble 
themes. It was so saturated with falsehood, exaggeration, false accusations, 
undue praise , vanity, satiric invectives, jesting and polytheistic obscenities 
that the Holy Prophet once remarked: "It is better that the interior of one of 
you be filled with pus than with poetic verses" However, if there was something 
good in a verse, he would appreciate it, and say, "Some verses are based on 
wisdom." When he heard the verses of Umayyah bin Abi-Salt, he said, "His verse 
is a believer but his heart a disbeliever." Once a Companion recited a hundred 
or so good verses before him, and he went on urging him to recite more.<br><br>
144This characteristic of the poets was just the antithesis of the Holy 
Prophet's conduct and practice. Everybody knew that the Holy Prophet said what 
he practiced and practiced what he said. The fact that there was complete 
conformity between his word and deed, could not be denied by anybody. On the 
contrary, everyone was well aware that the poets said one thing and practiced 
just the opposite of it. For instance, they would express noble themes of 
generosity, indifference to worldly wealth, contentment and self-respect in 
their poetry, but, in practical life, they would turn out to be extremely stingy 
and cowardly, avaricious and selfish. They would find fault with others on 
trifles, but would themselves be involved in grave moral weaknesses. <br><br>
145Here those poets have made an exception from the general reproach, who 
possess the following four characteristics:<br><br>(1) They should be believers 
in Allah, His Prophets, His Books and the Hereafter.<br><br>(2) They should be 
pious in practical life and not sinners, nor free from moral restrictions to say 
whatever they like.<br><br>(3) They should be remembering Allah much in their 
day to day lives as well as in their literary work. It should not be so that 
their personal lives reflect God-consciousness and piety, but their poetry is 
replete with themes of debauchery and lusts of the flesh, or that their poetry 
is full of serious themes of wisdom and God-consciousness, but their personal 
lives are devoid of any trace of the remembrance of Allah. As a matter of fact, 
both these states are equally despicable. A good poet is he who is God conscious 
in his personal life and whose poetic talent and skills also are devoted to the 
advancement of the way of life followed by the God-conscious, God-fearing and 
God-worshiping people.<br><br>(4) They should not satirize others for personal 
reasons, nor take vengeance on others on account of personal, racial and 
national prejudices, but when they are required to support the truth, they 
should use their literary powers like weapons of war against the unjust and 
treacherous people. It does not behoove the believers to adopt a humble, 
supplicating attitude against injustice and oppression. Traditions show that 
when the unbelieving and mushrik poets raised a storm of false accusations 
against Islam and the Holy Prophet and spread the poison of hatred against the 
Muslims, the Holy Prophet urged and encouraged the poets of Islam to counter 
attack them. Once he said to Ka`b bin Malik, "Satirize them, for, I swear by God 
in Whose hand is my soul, your verse will be more effective and damaging for 
them than the arrow. " Likewise he said to Hassan bin Thabit, "Deal with them 
and Gabriel is with you". And, "Say and the Holy Spirit is with you." Once he 
said, "The believer fights with the sword as well as with the tongue. " <br><br>
146"The iniquitous people": The people who out of sheer obduracy calumniated the 
Holy Prophet of being a sorcerer, poet and a mad and enchanted man, in order to 
defeat Islam, and to confuse the other people and distract them from his message 
and invitation.</p>
