                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
                        <p>The Surah is so entitled after the word `alaq in the second verse.</p>
                        <p><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>This Surah has two parts: the
                          first part consists of vv. 1-5, and the second of vv. 6-19. About the first part
                          a great majority of the Islamic scholars are agreed that it forms the very first
                          Revelation to be sent down to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace and
                          blessings). In this regard, the Hadith from Hadrat Aishah, which Imam Ahmad,
                          Bukhari, Muslim, and other traditionists have related with several chains of
                          authorities, is one of the most authentic Ahadith on the subject. In it Hadrat
                          Aishah has narrated the full story of the beginning of revelation as she herself
                          heard it from the Holy Messenger of Allah. Besides, Ibn Abbas, Abu Musa al-Ashari
                          and a group of the Companions also are reported to have stated that these were
                          the very first verses of the Quran to be revealed to the Holy Prophet. The
                          second part was sent down afterwards when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
                          began to perform the prescribed Prayer in the precincts of the Kabah and Abu
                        Jahl tried to prevent him from this with threats.</p>
                        <p><strong>Beginning of Revelation</strong><br><br>The traditionists have
                          related on the strength of their respective authorities the story of the
                          beginning of revelation from Imam Az-Zuhri, who had it from Hadrat Urwah bin
                          Zubair, who had it from Hadrat Aishah, his aunt. She states that revelations to
                          the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) began in the form of true (according to
                          other traditions, good) visions. Whichever vision he saw it seemed as though he
                          saw it in broad daylight. Afterwards solitude became dear to him and he would go
                          to the Cave of Hira to engage in worship there for several days and nights (Hadrat
                          Aishah has used the word tahannuth, which Imam Zuhri has explained as ta'abbud:
                          devotional exercises. This was some kind of worship which he performed, for
                          until then he had not been taught the method of performing the Prayer by Allah).
                          He would take provisions with him and stay there for several days, then would
                          return to Hadrat Khadijah who would again provide for him for a few more days.
                          One day when he was in the Cave of Hira, Revelation came down to him
                          unexpectedly and the Angel said, to him: "Read".<br><br>After this Hadrat Aishah
                          reports the words of the Holy Prophet himself, to the effect, "I said: I cannot
                          read! There upon the Angel took me and pressed me until I could bear it no more.
                          Then he left me and said: Read. I said: I cannot read! He pressed me a second
                          time until I could bear it no more. Then he left me and said: Read. I again
                          said: I cannot read! He pressed me for the third time until I could bear it no
                          more. Then he left me and said: Iqra bismi Rabbi kal- ladhi khalaqa: (Read in
                          the name of your Lord Who created) till he reached ma lam ya lam (what he did
                          not know).<br><br>Then the Holy Messenger (upon whom be peace) returned home to
                          Hadrat Khadijah trembling with fear, and said to her: `Cover me, cover me', and
                          he was covered. When terror left him, he said: `O Khadijah, what has happened to
                          me?' Then he narrated to her whatever had happened, and said: `I fear for my
                          life'. She said; `No never! Be of good cheer. By God, never will God debase you:
                          you treat the kindred well, you speak the truth, (one tradition adds: you
                          restore what is entrusted to you), you bear the burden of the helpless, you help
                          the poor, you entertain the guests, and you cooperate in good works.'<br><br>
                          Then she took him to Waraqah bin Naufal, who was her cousin. He had become a
                          Christian in pre-Islamic days, wrote the Gospel in Arabic and Hebrew, and had
                          become very old and blind. Hadrat Khadijah said: `Brother, listen to the son of
                          your brother.' Waraqah said to the Holy Prophet: `What have you seen, nephew?'
                          The Holy Prophet described what he had seen. Waraqah said; `This is the same
                          Gabriel (the Angel of Revelation) which Allah had sent down to Moses. Would that
                          I were a young man during your Prophethood! Would that I were alive when your
                          tribe would expel you!' The Holy Prophet said: `Will they expel me?' Waraqah
                          said; `Yes, never has it so happened that a person brought what you have brought
                          and was not treated as an enemy. If I live till then I would help you with all
                          the power at my command.' But not very long after this Waraqah died.<br><br>This
                          narrative is explicit that even until a moment before the coming Angel the Holy
                          Messenger of Allah (upon whom be His peace) was without any expectation that he
                          was going to be appointed a Prophet. Nothing to say of any such wish or
                          expectation, he did not even have any idea that he would meet with such an
                          experience. Coming down of the Revelation and appearing of the Angel face to
                          face was an unexpected accident for him the first effect of which on him was
                          precisely the same as could naturally be on a person meeting with such a
                          tremendous experience, in the absence of any preparation. That is why when he
                          proclaimed the message of Islam, the people of Makkah raised all sorts of
                          objections, but no one said that they were already apprehending that he would
                          make a claim, for he had been making preparations since long to become a
                          Prophet.<br><br>From this narrative another thing which also becomes obvious is
                          how pure was the Holy Prophet's life and how sublime was his character before
                          Prophethood, Hadrat Khadijah was no young lady: she was 55 years old at the time
                          this event took place and had been the Holy Prophet's life companion for 15
                          years. No weakness of the husband can remain hidden from the wife. She had
                          during this long period of married life found him to be such a generous and
                          noble man that when he told her of his experience in the Cave of Hira', she
                          admitted without the least hesitation that it was indeed Allah's own Angel who
                          had come to him with Revelation. Likewise, Waraqah bin Naufal also was an old
                          inhabitant of Makkah, who had seen the Holy Prophet grow up from childhood.
                          Particularly, for the past 15 years because of the close relationship he was
                          even more intimately aware of his life, his Affairs and dealings. When he also
                          heard of his experience, he did not regard it as an evil suggestion, but
                          immediately said that it was the same Gabriel who had descended on Moses (peace
                          be upon him). This meant that even according to him the Holy Prophet was such a
                          sublime person that there was nothing surprising in his being elevated to the
                        office of Prophethood.</p>
                        <p><strong>Occasion of Revelation of verses 6-19</strong><br><br>This second
                          part of thee Surah was revealed when the Holy Messenger of Allah began to
                          perform the Prayer in the Islamic way in the Ka'bahand Abu Jahl threatened and
                          tried to prevent him from this. It so happened that after his appointment to
                          Prophethood even before he could start preaching Islam openly, he began to
                          perform the Prayer in the precincts of the Ka'bahin the way Allah taught him;
                          and from this the Quraish felt for the first time that he had adopted a new
                          religion. The other people were watching it with curiosity, but Abu Jahl in his
                          arrogance and pride threatened the Holy Prophet and forbade him to worship in
                          that way in the Ka'bah. In this connection, quite a number of the Ahadith have
                          been related from Hadarat Abdullah ibn Abbas and Hadrat Abu Huraira, which
                          mention the foolish behaviour of Abu Jahl.<br><br>Hadrat Abu Huraira says that
                          Abu Jahl asked the people of Quraish: "Does Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
                          and blessings) set his face on the ground before you?"When they replied in the
                          affirmative, he said:"By Lat and Uzza, if I ever catch him in that act of
                          worship, I would set my foot on his neck and rub his face in the dust."Then it
                          so happened that he saw the Holy Messenger in that posture and came forward to
                          set his foot on his neck, but suddenly turned back as if in a fright and being
                          asked what was the matter, he said there was a ditch of fire and a terrible
                          apparition between himself and Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
                          blessings) and some wings. On hearing this the Holy Prophet remarked:"Had he
                          come near me, the angels would have smitten and torn him to pieces." (Ahmad,
                          Muslim, Nasai, Ibn Jarir, Ibn AbI Hatim, Ibn al-Mundhir, lbn Marduyah, Abu
                          Nu'aim Isfahani, Baihaqi).<br><br>According to lbn Abbas, Abu Jahl said:"If I
                          caught Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) performing his Prayer
                          by the Ka'bah, I would trample his neck down." When the Holy Prophet heard of
                          it, he said: "If he acted so, the angels would seize him there and then?" (Bukhari,
                          Tirmidhi, Nasai, Ibn Jarir, Abdur Razzaq, Abd bin Humaid, Ibn al- Mundhir, Ibn
                          Marduyah).<br><br>According to another tradition from Ibn Abbas, the Holy
                          Prophet was performing his Prayer at the Maqam Ibrahim. Abu Jahl passed that way
                          and said: "O Muhammad, did I not forbid you this, and then he started to
                          threaten him." In reply the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) rebuked him
                          severely. There upon he said:"O Muhammad, on what strength do you rebuke me? By
                          God, my followers in this valley far exceed yours in number." (Ahmad, Tirmidhi,
                          Nasai, Ibn Jarir, lbn Abi Shaibah, Ibn al-Mundhir, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah).<br>
                          <br>Because of these very incidents the portion of this Surah beginning with
                          Kalla inn al-insana la yat gha was sent down. Naturally the place of this part
                          should be the same as assigned to it in this Surah of the Quran, for after the
                          coming down of the first Revelation the Holy Prophet had given expression to
                          Islam first of all by the act of Prayer, and his conflict with the pagans. <br>
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><br>As we have explained in the Introduction, when the Angel said to the Holy
                          Prophet, "Read", the latter replied, "I cannot read!"" This indicates that the
                          Angel had presented these words of the Revelation before him in the written form
                          and had asked him to read them. For if the Angel had meant that he should repeat
                          what he recited, he should not have replied, saying "I cannot read!" <br><br>
                          2"Read in the name of your Lord": Bismillah and read. This shows that the Holy
                          Prophet (upon whom be peace) even before the coming down of this Revelation
                          regarded and acknowledged Allah alone as his Lord. That is why there was no need
                          to ask who his Lord was, but it was said: "Read in the name of your Lord." <br>
                          <br>3Only the word khalaqa (created) 'has been used absolutely, and the object
                          of creation has not been mentioned, This automatically gives the meaning: "Read
                          in the name of the Lord, Who is the Creator, Who created the whole universe and
                          everything in it." <br><br>4After making mention generally of the creation of
                          the universe, mention has been made of man in particular, saying how Allah made
                          him a perfect man starting his creation from an insignificant and humble state.
                          'Alaq is plural of 'alaqah, which means congealed blood. This is the primary
                          state of the embryo which appears a few days after conception. Then it assumes
                          the form of a lump of flesh, then afterwards it gradually takes human shape.
                          (For details, see AI-Hajj: 5 and the corresponding E.N.'s 5 to 7). <br><br>5That
                          is, "It is a great favor of Allah that starting man's creation from a most
                          insignificant state He made him possessor of knowledge which is the noblest
                          attribute of creation, and He made him not only possessor of knowledge but also
                          taught him the art of writing by the use of pen, which became the means of
                          propagation, progress, dissemination and preservation of knowledge on a large
                          scale. Had He not given man the knowledge of the art of pen and writing (by
                          inspiration) his intellectual faculty would have stagnated, and it would have
                          had no opportunity to develop, expand and become a means of transmission of
                          knowledge from one generation to the next and make future progress. <br><br>
                          6That is, Man originally was absolutely illiterate. Whatever of knowledge he
                          obtained, he obtained it as a gift from Allah. Whatever doors of knowledge at
                          any stage did Allah will to open for man, they went on opining up before him.
                          This same thing has been expressed in the verse of the Throne, thus: "And the
                          people cannot comprehend anything of His knowledge save what He Himself may
                          please to reveal." (Al-Baqarah: 255). Whatever man looks upon as his own
                          scientific discovery was, in fact, unknown to him before. Allah gave him its
                          knowledge whenever He willed without his realizing that Allah by His grace had
                          blessed him with the knowledge of it.<br><br>These verses were the very first to
                          be revealed to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), as is stated in the Hadith
                          reported by Hadrat `A'ishah. This first experience was so intense and tremendous
                          that the Holy Prophet could not bear it any more. Therefore, at that time he was
                          only made aware that the Being Whom he already knew and acknowledged as his Lord
                          and Sustainer was in direct communion with him, had started sending down
                          Revelations to him, and had appointed him as His Prophet. Then after an
                          intermission the opening verses of Surah al-Muddaththir were revealed in which
                          he was told what mission he had to perform after his appointment to Prophethood.
                          (For explanation, see Introduction to Al-Muddaththir)<br><br>7That is, man
                          should never adopt an attitude of ignorance and rebellion against the Bountiful
                          God Who has been so generous to him.<br><br>8That is, when the man has attained
                          wealth, honor and rank and whatever else he desired to attain in the world, he
                          becomes rebellious instead of being grateful and transgresses the boundaries of
                          servitude to Allah. <br><br>9That is, "Whatever he might have attained in the
                          world, which makes ,him behave arrogantly and rebelliously, in the end he has to
                          return to your Lord. Then he will realize what fate awaits him in consequence of
                          his such attitude and behavior." <br><br>10"A Servant" : the Holy Messenger of
                          Allah himself. The Holy Prophet has been mentioned by this epithet at several
                          places in the Qur'an. For example, "Glory be to Him Who transported His servant
                          one night from the Masjid al Haram to the distant Temple." (Bani Isra'il: 1);
                          "All praise is for Allah Who has sent down this Book to His servant." (AI-Kahf:
                          1); "And that when the servant of Allah stood up to pray, the people got ready
                          to assault him." (Al-Jinn: 19). This shows that it is a special style of love by
                          which Allah makes mention of His Messenger Muhammad (upon whom be His peace and
                          blessings) in His Book. Besides, it also shows that Allah after appointing His
                          Messenger to Prophethood had taught him the method of performing the Prayer.
                          There is no mention of this method anywhere in the Qur'an, saying: "O Prophet,
                          perform the Prayer in this and this way." Hence, this is another proof that the
                          Revelation sent down to the Holy Prophet did not only consist of what has been
                          recorded in the Qur'an, but besides this, other things also were taught to him
                          by revelation, which are not recorded in the Qur'an. <br><br>11The audience here
                          apparently is every just man, who is being asked: Have you watched the act of
                          the person who prevents a Servant from God's worship? What do you think: if the
                          Servant be rightly guided, or warning the people to fear God and refrain from
                          evil, and this forbidden be denying the Truth and turning away from it, what
                          will his act be like? Could this man adopt such an attitude had he known that
                          Allah is watching the man who is exhorting others to piety as well as him who is
                          denying the truth and turning away from it? Allah's watching the oppressor and
                          his wrongdoing and the oppressed and his misery by itself implies that He will
                          punish the oppressor and redress the grievances of the wronged and down-trodden
                          person. <br><br>12That is, the person who threatens that he would trample the
                          neck of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) down when he
                          performed the Prayer, would never be able to do so.<br><br>13"The forelock" here
                          implies the person with the forelock. <br><br>14As we have explained in the
                          Introduction, when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) rebuked Abu Jahl on his
                          foolish behavior, he had retorted: "O Muhammad, on what strength do you threaten
                          me? By God, my supporters in this valley far exceed yours in number." At this it
                          is being said: "Let him call his band of supporters." <br><br>15According to the
                          explanation given by Qatadah, the word zabaniyah in the original, is used for
                          the police in Arabic idiom, and zaban actually means to push away. The kings too
                          kept armed attendants who would push out the one with whom the king was annoyed
                          and angry. Therefore, what Allah means is: "Let him call his supporters; We too
                          shall summon Our Police, i.e. the angels of torment, to deal with him and his
                          supporters." <br><br>16"Sajdah" (prostration) here implies the Prayer, so as to
                          say: "O Prophet, continue to perform your Prayer fearlessly as you have been in
                          the past, and seek your Lord's presence through it." In the Sahih of Muslim and
                          other books of Hadith there is a tradition from Hadrat Abu Huraira to the
                          effect: "The servant is nearest to his Lord when he is in the state of
                          prostration", and in Muslim there is also a tradition from Hadrat Abu Hurairah
                          that when the Holy Prophet recited this verse, he performed a sajdah of recital.<br>
