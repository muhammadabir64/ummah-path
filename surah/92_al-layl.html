                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
                        <p>The Surah takes its name from the word wal-lail with which it opens.</p>
                        <p><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>Its subject matter so closely
                          resembles that of Surah Ash-Shams that each Surah seems to be an explanation of
                          the other. It is one and the same thing which has been explained in Surah
                          Ash-Shams in one way and in this Surah in another. This indicates that both
                        these Surahs were sent down in about the same period.</p>
                        <p><strong>Theme and Subject Matter</strong><br><br>Its theme is to distinguish
                          between the two different ways of life and to explain the contrast between their
                          ultimate ends and results. In view of the subject matter this Surah consists of
                          two parts, the first part consisting of vv. 1-11 and the second of vv. 12-21.<br>
                          <br>In the first part, at the outset it has been pointed out that the strivings
                          and doings that the individuals, nations and groups of mankind are engaged in in
                          the world, are, in respect of their moral nature, as divergent as the day is
                          from the night, and the male from the female. After this, according to the
                          general style of the brief Surahs of the Quran, three moral characteristics of
                          one kind and three moral characteristics of the other kind have been presented
                          as an illustration from among a vast collection of the strivings and activities
                          of man, from which every man can judge which style of life is represented by one
                          kind of the characteristics and which style of life by the other kind. Both
                          these styles have been described in such brief, elegant. and pithy sentences
                          that they move the heart and go down into memory as soon as one hears them.
                          Characteristics of the first kind are that one should spend one's wealth, adopt
                          God-consciousness and piety, and acknowledge the good as good. The second kind
                          of the characteristics are that one should be miserly, should least care for
                          God's pleasure and His displeasure, and should repudiate what is good and right.
                          Then it has been stated that these two modes of action which are clearly
                          divergent, cannot be equal and alike in respect of their results. But, just as
                          they are divergent in their nature, so they are divergent in their results. The
                          person (or group of persons) who adopts the first mode of action, Allah will
                          make easy for him the correct way of life, so much so that doing good will
                          become easy for him and doing evil difficult. On the contrary, he who adopts the
                          second mode of life, Allah will make easy for him the difficult and hard way of
                          life, so much so that doing evil will become easy for him and doing good
                          difficult. This passage has been concluded with a most effective and touching
                          sentence, saying: "This worldly wealth for the sake of which man is even
                          prepared to risk his life will not go down with him into the grave; therefore,
                          what will it avail him after death?"<br><br>In the second part also three truths
                          have been stated equally briefly. First, that Allah has not left man uninformed
                          in the examination hall of the world, but He has taken on Himself the
                          responsibility to tell him which one is the straight and right way out of the
                          different ways of life. Here, there was no need to point out that by sending His
                          Messenger and His Book He has fulfilled His this responsibility, for both the
                          Messenger and the Book were present to afford the guidance. Second, that the
                          Master of both the world and the Hereafter is Allah alone. If you seek the
                          world, it is He Who will give it, and if you seek the Hereafter, again it is He
                          Who will give it. Now, it is for you to decide what you should seek from Him.
                          The third truth that has been stated is that the wretched one who rejects the
                          good, which is being presented through the Messenger and the Book, and turns
                          away from it, will have a blazing fire ready for him. As for the God fearing
                          person who spends his wealth in a good cause, without any selfish motive, only
                          for the sake of winning his Lord's good pleasure, his Lord will be pleased with
                          him and will bless him with so much that he will be well pleased with Him. <br>
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><br>This is that for which an oath has been sworn by the night and the day,
                          and the creation of the male and the female. It means to say: Just as the night
                          and the day, and the male and the female, are different from each other, and
                          their effects and results are mutually contradictory, so are the aims and
                          objects for which men are endeavoring and struggling, different in their nature
                          and contradictory with regard to their results. In the following verses, it has
                          been told that all these divided endeavors are divided into two main kinds. <br>
                          <br>2This is the first kind of endeavors, which includes three things, and a
                          little consideration shows that they comprehend all virtues:<br><br>(1) That Man
                          should refrain from wealth-worship, but should spend whatever Allah has given
                          him generously in rendering Allah's and His servants' rights, for good works and
                          for helping others;<br><br>(2) that he should fear God and refrain from things
                          which cause His displeasure in his moral, social, economic and other dealings
                          with the people;<br><br>(3) that he should believe in goodness. Goodness is a
                          comprehensive word, which includes goodness of belief, morals and acts. Goodness
                          of belief means that one should give up polytheism; atheism, and disbelief, and
                          affirm faith in Tauhid, the Hereafter, and Prophethood. Affirming belief in
                          goodness of morals and acts is that one should not be doing good and right
                          merely unconsciously, outside a definite system, but one should acknowledge as
                          right and sound the system of goodness which God has sent, which combines every
                          kind of goodness in all its forms and aspects into a system comprehensively
                          called the Divine Shari'ah. <br><br>3This is the result of the first kind of
                          endeavoring and struggling. The easy way implies the way which is in accordance
                          with human nature, which is in accordance with the will of the Creator, Who has
                          created man and the whole _ universe. It is a way in which man has not to fight
                          his conscience, in which he does not have to force his faculties of mind and
                          energies of body into doing works for which they are not given but to do things
                          for which they have actually been given him. It is a way in which man has not to
                          experience war, resistance and conflict on every side, which he has to
                          experience in a life full of sin, but a human society in which at every step he
                          experiences peace and concord, appreciation and honor. Obviously, the person who
                          spends his wealth for public welfare, treats every other person kindly and well,
                          whose life is free from crime, sin and immorality, who is righteous and fair in
                          his dealings, who neither cheats others nor proves false in his promises, from
                          whom no one apprehends dishonesty, injustice and excess, and with whose
                          character no one finds any fault, will in any case be honored and respected in
                          any society, however, corrupt and depraved it may be. Hearts will be attracted
                          towards him in esteem and regard; his own heart and conscience will be
                          satisfied, and he will attain to dignity in society which no immoral person can
                          ever attain. This same thing has been expressed in Surah AnNahl, thus: "Whoever
                          does righteous deeds whether male or female, provided that he is a believer, We
                          will surely grant him to live a pure life in this world (v. 97)", and in Surah
                          Maryam, thus "The Merciful ,will fill with love the hearts of those who believe
                          and do righteous deeds (v. 86). This then is the way in which there is nothing
                          but joy and tranquility for man, for the world till the Hereafter. Its results
                          are not transient and temporary but eternal and everlasting.<br><br>Concerning
                          this Allah says "We shall facilitate for him the easy way." It means to say
                          "When after affirming goodness he decides that this way alone suits him, and the
                          evil way does not suit him, and when by making sacrifices and adopting the life
                          of -taqwa practically he proves that he is true in his affirmation, Allah will
                          make easy for him to walk this way. Then, to commit evil will become difficult
                          for him, and to do good easy. When unlawful wealth comes before him, he will not
                          regard it as a good bargain, but consider it a hot piece of burning coal, which
                          he cannot hold in his hand. When opportunities for sin appear before him, he
                          will not rush to seize them as opportunities for pleasure and enjoyment, but
                          will look upon them as gates to Hell and will flee them. The Prayer will not be
                          hard for him, and hem will have no internal peace until he has performed it at
                          its appointed time. He will not feel hurt when paying the zakat, but will regard
                          his wealth as impure until he has paid out the Zakat from it. In short, at every
                          step, Allah will favor him with His grace and help him to follow this way;
                          conditions will be made favorable for him and he will be helped out of every
                          difficulty.<br><br>Now, the question arises that in Surah Al-Baled above this
                          very way has been called an uphill road, and hire it has been described as an
                          easy way How can the two things be reconciled? The answer is that before a man
                          has adopted this way, it appears to be a steep, uphill road, for ascending which
                          he has to fight his desires, his materialistic members of the family, his
                          relatives, his friends and those with whom he has social and other dealings, and
                          above all Satan, for each one of them obstructs his way, and makes it seem
                          dreadful. But after man has affirmed goodness and resolved to follow this way,
                          and giving away his wealth in the cause of God and adopting the way of taqwa,
                          has practically strengthened his resolve, ascending the steep road becomes easy
                          and slipping into the abyss of moral depravities becomes difficult for him. <br>
                          <br>4This is the second kind of human endeavoring, which in every part of it is
                          different from the corresponding part of the first kind. Niggardliness (bukhl)
                          is not merely the niggardliness because of which people generally regard a
                          person as niggardly if he hoards money: neither spends it on himself nor on his
                          children, but bukhl here implies to refrain from spending in the cause of Allah
                          and public welfare. According to this, niggardly is every person who spends
                          generously, rather squanders money, on his self, for his own ease and comfort,
                          interests and enjoyments, but, as. for a good cause, spends nothing, or, if at
                          all he spends anything, ii is for display, or to win a reputation and name, or
                          to have access to officers, or to obtain some benefit and gain. Independence of
                          God implies that one should make worldly, material benefits only the object of
                          all one's endeavors and strivings and being independent of God should least care
                          to see what pleases Him and what displeases Him. As for belying goodness, it is
                          in sharp contrast to believing in goodness in every detail, therefore, it need
                          not be explained here as it has already been explained above.<br><br>5This way
                          has been called the hard way, for although the one who follows it, does so for
                          the sake of material benefits, worldly enjoyments and superficial successes, yet
                          while following it he is always at war with his nature his conscience, the laws
                          made by the Creator of the universe and the society in Which he lives. When he
                          transgresses all moral limits of truth, honesty, nobility, purity and chastity
                          and endeavors to satisfy his interests and desires in every way, when the people
                          feel harmed by him rather than benefiting from him, and when he encroaches upon
                          the rights of others and violates people's honor, he feels disgraced in his own
                          eyes and has to clash at every step with the society in which he lives. If he is
                          weak, he has to suffer every kind of punishment on account of his conduct, and
                          if he is wealthy, strong and influential, the world may lie low before him, but
                          no one cherishes any good wishes, any feeling of honor and love for him; so much
                          so that even his associates and companions regard him as a wicked man. And this
                          thing is not only restricted to individuals, even when a strong and powerful
                          nation transgresses the bounds of morality and adopts an immoral conduct, in
                          arrogance of pride and wealth, it earns on the one hand, the enmity of the
                          outside world: on the other, its own society falls a victim to all sorts of
                          crime, prevalence of suicide, intoxication, venereal diseases, destruction of
                          family life, waywardness of the new generation, class conflict and
                          ever-increasing injustice and tyranny. So much so that when it falls from its
                          position of prestige, it leaves nothing behind except curses and condemnation
                          for itself in the history of the world.<br><br>As for saying that "We shall
                          facilitate for him the hard ways", it means: He will be deprived of the grace to
                          follow the way of good, gates of evil will be opened up for him, means and
                          resources for the same will be provided for him, doing evil will become easy,
                          and doing good will become toilsome and risky for him. This same theme has been
                          expressed at another place in the Qur'an, thus: "So whomever Allah wills to
                          guide aright, He makes his breast wide open to Islam, and whomever He wills to
                          let go astray, he makes his breast narrow and squeezes it so tightly that ( at
                          the very idea of Islam) he begins to feel as though his soul were climbing up
                          towards the sky." (Al-An`am :125) . At another place it has been said: "No
                          doubt, salat is a hard task but not for the obedient servants." (Al Baqarah:
                          46). And about the hypocrites it has been said: "When they come to offer the
                          salat, they come reluctantly and they expend in the way of Allah with unwilling
                          hearts." (At-Taubah: 54), and that: "There are such among them, who regard what
                          they expend in the way of Allah as a penalty." (At-Taubah: 98). <br><br>6In
                          other words it means that he has to die one day and leave behind in the world
                          whatever he had amassed for his ease and enjoyment. If he did not earn and send
                          forward something for the Hereafter, what would this wealth avail him? He will
                          not take his palatial residence, his majestic conveyance, his property and
                          wealth into the grave.<br><br>7That is, Allah as the Creator of man has on the
                          basis of His wisdom, His justice and His mercy, taken of Himself the
                          responsibility not to leave him uninformed in the world, but to tell him what is
                          the right way and what are the wrong ways, what is good and what is evil , what
                          is lawful and what is unlawful, what attitude and conduct will make him an
                          obedient servant and what attitude and conduct will make him a disobedient
                          servant. This same thing has been expressed in Surah An-Nahl; thus: "Allah has
                          taken upon Himself to show the Right Way, when there are also crooked ways."
                          (v.9) (For explanation, See E.N. 9 of AnNahl). <br><br>8This statement has
                          several meanings and all are correct:<br><br>(1)"That from the world till the
                          Hereafter, you are nowhere beyond Our grasp, for Ours are both this and the next
                          world;"<br><br>(2) "that both this world and the Hereafter are in any case under
                          Our sovereignty, whether you follow the way shown by Us or not. If you adopt
                          error, you will not harm Us but only yourselves; and if you adopt the right way,
                          you will not do any good to Us, but will do good only to yourselves. Your
                          disobedience cannot cause any decrease in Our sovereignty and your obedience
                          cannot cause any increase in it;"<br><br>(3) "that We alone are Master of both
                          the worlds. If you seek the world, We alone can grant it; and if you seek the
                          well being of the Hereafter, We alone have the power to bestow it too,"<br><br>
                          This very theme has been expressed in Al-`Imran: 145: "Whoso makes effort with
                          the intention of the reward of this world, We will reward him in this world, and
                          whoso makes effort with the intention of the reward of the Hereafter, We shall
                          grant him thereof", and the same has been expressed in Ash-Shu`ara: 20, thus:
                          "Whoever seeks the harvest of the Hereafter, We do increase his harvest; and
                          whoever seeks the harvest of this world, We do give him of it here, but in the
                          Hereafter he will have no share at all." (For explanation, see E.N. 105 of
                          Al`Imran, E.N. 37 of Ash-Shura). <br><br>9This does not mean that no one will
                          enter the fire except the most wretched one, and no one will be saved from it
                          except the most pious one but the object is to describe the extremely
                          contradictory fate of the two extremely contradictory' characters. One of them
                          is the person who belies the teachings of Allah and His Messenger and turns away
                          from obedience; the other one is the person, who not only believes but also
                          spends his wealth in the cause of Allah sincerely, without any desire for
                          display and reputation, only in order to be regarded as a pure man in His eyes.
                          Both these types of character were present in the Makkah society of that day.
                          Therefore., without mentioning any name, the people have been told that the man
                          of the first type of character only will burn in the fire of Hell and not the
                          man of the second type of character; the man of the second type of character
                          only will be kept away from it and not the man of the first type of character.
                          <br><br>10This is further explanation of the sincerity of the pious man. He was
                          not indebted in any way to the people on whom he spends his wealth so that he
                          may be doing so in order to repay for favors received, or may be giving gifts
                          and holding banquets to them in order to further benefit from them, but he is
                          helping such people only in order to seek the goodwill of his Lord, the Supreme.
                          He was neither indebted to them before, nor he expects any favors from them in
                          the future. Its best illustration is the act of Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (may
                          Allah bless him), He would purchase and set free the poor slaves and
                          slaves-girls who accepted Islam in Makkah and were cruelly treated by their
                          masters on that account. Ibn Jarir and Ibn 'Asakir have related, on the
                          authority of Hadrat 'Amir bin 'Abdullah bin Zubair, that when Hadrat Abu Bakr's
                          father saw him spending money to purchase the freedom of the poor slaves and
                          slave-girls, he said to him: "Son, I see that you are getting the weak people
                          free; had you spent this money on the freedom of strong, young men, they would
                          have become your helpers and supporters." Hadrat Abu Bakr replied: "Dear father,
                          I only seek the reward that is with Allah." <br><br>11This verse can have two
                          meanings and both are correct:<br><br>(1) "That Allah certainly will be well
                          pleased with him;" and<br><br>(2) "that Allah soon will bless this man with so
                        much that he will be happy." </p>
