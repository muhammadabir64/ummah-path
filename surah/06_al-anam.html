                  <li class="collection-item"> Praise be Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the light. Yet those who reject Faith hold (others) as equal, with their Guardian-Lord.</li><li class="collection-item"> He it is created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term (for you). And there is in His presence another determined term; yet ye doubt within yourselves!</li><li class="collection-item"> And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth. He knoweth what ye hide, and what ye reveal, and He knoweth the (recompense) which ye earn (by your deeds).</li><li class="collection-item"> But never did a single one of the signs of their Lord reach them, but they turned away therefrom.</li><li class="collection-item"> And now they reject the truth when it reaches them: but soon shall they learn the reality of what they used to mock at.</li><li class="collection-item"> See they not how many of those before them We did destroy?- generations We had established on the earth, in strength such as We have not given to you - for whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave (fertile) streams flowing beneath their (feet): yet for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in their wake fresh generations (to succeed them).</li><li class="collection-item"> If We had sent unto thee a written (message) on parchment, so that they could touch it with their hands, the Unbelievers would have been sure to say: "This is nothing but obvious magic!"</li><li class="collection-item"> They say: "Why is not an angel sent down to him?" If we did send down an angel, the matter would be settled at once, and no respite would be granted them.</li><li class="collection-item"> If We had made it an angel, We should have sent him as a man, and We should certainly have caused them confusion in a matter which they have already covered with confusion.</li><li class="collection-item"> Mocked were (many) messengers before thee; but their scoffers were hemmed in by the thing that they mocked.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who rejected Truth."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "To whom belongeth all that is in the heavens and on earth?" Say: "To Allah. He hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) Mercy. That He will gather you together for the Day of Judgment, there is no doubt whatever. It is they who have lost their own souls, that will not believe.</li><li class="collection-item"> To him belongeth all that dwelleth (or lurketh) in the night and the day. For he is the one who heareth and knoweth all things."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Shall I take for my protector any other than Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth? And He it is that feedeth but is not fed." Say: "Nay! but I am commanded to be the first of those who bow to Allah (in Islam), and be not thou of the company of those who join gods with Allah."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "I would, if I disobeyed my Lord, indeed have fear of the penalty of a Mighty Day.</li><li class="collection-item"> "On that day, if the penalty is averted from any, it is due to Allah´s mercy; And that would be (Salvation), the obvious fulfilment of all desire.</li><li class="collection-item"> "If Allah touch thee with affliction, none can remove it but He; if He touch thee with happiness, He hath power over all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> "He is the irresistible, (watching) from above over His worshippers; and He is the Wise, acquainted with all things."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "What thing is most weighty in evidence?" Say: "Allah is witness between me and you; This Qur´an hath been revealed to me by inspiration, that I may warn you and all whom it reaches. Can ye possibly bear witness that besides Allah there is another Allah?" Say: "Nay! I cannot bear witness!" Say: "But in truth He is the one Allah, and I truly am innocent of (your blasphemy of) joining others with Him."</li><li class="collection-item"> Those to whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons. Those who have lost their own souls refuse therefore to believe.</li><li class="collection-item"> Who doth more wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah or rejecteth His signs? But verily the wrong-doers never shall prosper.</li><li class="collection-item"> One day shall We gather them all together: We shall say to those who ascribed partners (to Us): "Where are the partners whom ye (invented and) talked about?"</li><li class="collection-item"> There will then be (left) no subterfuge for them but to say: "By Allah our Lord, we were not those who joined gods with Allah."</li><li class="collection-item"> Behold! how they lie against their own souls! But the (lie) which they invented will leave them in the lurch.</li><li class="collection-item"> Of them there are some who (pretend to) listen to thee; but We have thrown veils on their hearts, So they understand it not, and deafness in their ears; if they saw every one of the signs, not they will believe in them; in so much that when they come to thee, they (but) dispute with thee; the Unbelievers say: "These are nothing but tales of the ancients."</li><li class="collection-item"> Others they keep away from it, and themselves they keep away; but they only destroy their own souls, and they perceive it not.</li><li class="collection-item"> If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with the Fire! They will say: "Would that we were but sent back! Then would we not reject the signs of our Lord, but would be amongst those who believe!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Yea, in their own (eyes) will become manifest what before they concealed. But if they were returned, they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden, for they are indeed liars.</li><li class="collection-item"> And they (sometimes) say: "There is nothing except our life on this earth, and never shall we be raised up again."</li><li class="collection-item"> If thou couldst but see when they are confronted with their Lord! He will say: "Is not this the truth?" They will say: "Yea, by our Lord!" He will say: "Taste ye then the penalty, because ye rejected Faith."</li><li class="collection-item"> Lost indeed are they who treat it as a falsehood that they must meet Allah,- until on a sudden the hour is on them, and they say: "Ah! woe unto us that we took no thought of it"; for they bear their burdens on their backs, and evil indeed are the burdens that they bear?</li><li class="collection-item"> What is the life of this world but play and amusement? But best is the home in the hereafter, for those who are righteous. Will ye not then understand?</li><li class="collection-item"> We know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee: It is not thee they reject: it is the signs of Allah, which the wicked contemn.</li><li class="collection-item"> Rejected were the messengers before thee: with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs, until Our aid did reach them: there is none that can alter the words (and decrees) of Allah. Already hast thou received some account of those messengers.</li><li class="collection-item"> If their spurning is hard on thy mind, yet if thou wert able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign,- (what good?). If it were Allah´s will, He could gather them together unto true guidance: so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance (and impatience)!</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who listen (in truth), be sure, will accept: as to the dead, Allah will raise them up; then will they be turned unto Him.</li><li class="collection-item"> They say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Allah hath certainly power to send down a sign: but most of them understand not.</li><li class="collection-item"> There is not an animal (that lives) on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of) communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they (all) shall be gathered to their Lord in the end.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb,- in the midst of darkness profound: whom Allah willeth, He leaveth to wander: whom He willeth, He placeth on the way that is straight.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Think ye to yourselves, if there come upon you the wrath of Allah, or the Hour (that ye dread), would ye then call upon other than Allah?- (reply) if ye are truthful!</li><li class="collection-item"> "Nay,- On Him would ye call, and if it be His will, He would remove (the distress) which occasioned your call upon Him, and ye would forget (the false gods) which ye join with Him!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Before thee We sent (messengers) to many nations, and We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity, that they might learn humility.</li><li class="collection-item"> When the suffering reached them from us, why then did they not learn humility? On the contrary their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them.</li><li class="collection-item"> But when they forgot the warning they had received, We opened to them the gates of all (good) things, until, in the midst of their enjoyment of Our gifts, on a sudden, We called them to account, when lo! they were plunged in despair!</li><li class="collection-item"> Of the wrong-doers the last remnant was cut off. Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher of the worlds.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Think ye, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who - a god other than Allah - could restore them to you?" See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); yet they turn aside.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Think ye, if the punishment of Allah comes to you, whether suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed except those who do wrong?</li><li class="collection-item"> We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend (their lives),- upon them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who reject our signs,- them shall punishment touch, for that they ceased not from transgressing.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I tell you I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me." Say: "can the blind be held equal to the seeing?" Will ye then consider not?</li><li class="collection-item"> Give this warning to those in whose (hearts) is the fear that they will be brought (to judgment) before their Lord: except for Him they will have no protector nor intercessor: that they may guard (against evil).</li><li class="collection-item"> Send not away those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His face. In naught art thou accountable for them, and in naught are they accountable for thee, that thou shouldst turn them away, and thus be (one) of the unjust.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thus did We try some of them by comparison with others, that they should say: "Is it these then that Allah hath favoured from amongst us?" Doth not Allah know best those who are grateful?</li><li class="collection-item"> When those come to thee who believe in Our signs, Say: "Peace be on you: Your Lord hath inscribed for Himself (the rule of) mercy: verily, if any of you did evil in ignorance, and thereafter repented, and amend (his conduct), lo! He is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thus do We explain the signs in detail: that the way of the sinners may be shown up.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "I am forbidden to worship those - others than Allah - whom ye call upon." Say: "I will not follow your wain desires: If I did, I would stray from the path, and be not of the company of those who receive guidance."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "For me, I (work) on a clear sign from my Lord, but ye reject Him. What ye would see hastened, is not in my power. The command rests with none but Allah: He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "If what ye would see hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me. But Allah knoweth best those who do wrong."</li><li class="collection-item"> With Him are the keys of the unseen, the treasures that none knoweth but He. He knoweth whatever there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf doth fall but with His knowledge: there is not a grain in the darkness (or depths) of the earth, nor anything fresh or dry (green or withered), but is (inscribed) in a record clear (to those who can read).</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He who doth take your souls by night, and hath knowledge of all that ye have done by day: by day doth He raise you up again; that a term appointed be fulfilled; In the end unto Him will be your return; then will He show you the truth of all that ye did.</li><li class="collection-item"> He is the irresistible, (watching) from above over His worshippers, and He sets guardians over you. At length, when death approaches one of you, Our angels take his soul, and they never fail in their duty.</li><li class="collection-item"> Then are men returned unto Allah, their protector, the (only) reality: Is not His the command? and He is the swiftest in taking account.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Who is it that delivereth you from the dark recesses of land and sea, when ye call upon Him in humility and silent terror: ´If He only delivers us from these (dangers), (we vow) we shall truly show our gratitude´?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Say "It is Allah that delivereth you from these and all (other) distresses: and yet ye worship false gods!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "He hath power to send calamities on you, from above and below, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, giving you a taste of mutual vengeance - each from the other." See how We explain the signs by various (symbols); that they may understand.</li><li class="collection-item"> But thy people reject this, though it is the truth. Say: "Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs;</li><li class="collection-item"> For every message is a limit of time, and soon shall ye know it."</li><li class="collection-item"> When thou seest men engaged in vain discourse about Our signs, turn away from them unless they turn to a different theme. If Satan ever makes thee forget, then after recollection, sit not thou in the company of those who do wrong.</li><li class="collection-item"> On their account no responsibility falls on the righteous, but (their duty) is to remind them, that they may (learn to) fear Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> Leave alone those who take their religion to be mere play and amusement, and are deceived by the life of this world. But proclaim (to them) this (truth): that every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own acts: it will find for itself no protector or intercessor except Allah: if it offered every ransom, (or reparation), none will be accepted: such is (the end of) those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts: they will have for drink (only) boiling water, and for punishment, one most grievous: for they persisted in rejecting Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Shall we indeed call on others besides Allah,- things that can do us neither good nor harm,- and turn on our heels after receiving guidance from Allah? - like one whom the evil ones have made into a fool, wandering bewildered through the earth, his friends calling, come to us´, (vainly) guiding him to the path." Say: "Allah´s guidance is the (only) guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Lord of the worlds;-</li><li class="collection-item"> "To establish regular prayers and to fear Allah: for it is to Him that we shall be gathered together."</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He who created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): the day He saith, "Be," behold! it is. His word is the truth. His will be the dominion the day the trumpet will be blown. He knoweth the unseen as well as that which is open. For He is the Wise, well acquainted (with all things).</li><li class="collection-item"> Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar: "Takest thou idols for gods? For I see thee and thy people in manifest error."</li><li class="collection-item"> So also did We show Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the earth, that he might (with understanding) have certitude.</li><li class="collection-item"> When the night covered him over, He saw a star: He said: "This is my Lord." But when it set, He said: "I love not those that set."</li><li class="collection-item"> When he saw the moon rising in splendour, he said: "This is my Lord." But when the moon set, He said: "unless my Lord guide me, I shall surely be among those who go astray."</li><li class="collection-item"> When he saw the sun rising in splendour, he said: "This is my Lord; this is the greatest (of all)." But when the sun set, he said: "O my people! I am indeed free from your (guilt) of giving partners to Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> "For me, I have set my face, firmly and truly, towards Him Who created the heavens and the earth, and never shall I give partners to Allah."</li><li class="collection-item"> His people disputed with him. He said: "(Come) ye to dispute with me, about Allah, when He (Himself) hath guided me? I fear not (the beings) ye associate with Allah: Unless my Lord willeth, (nothing can happen). My Lord comprehendeth in His knowledge all things. Will ye not (yourselves) be admonished?</li><li class="collection-item"> "How should I fear (the beings) ye associate with Allah, when ye fear not to give partners to Allah without any warrant having been given to you? Which of (us) two parties hath more right to security? (tell me) if ye know.</li><li class="collection-item"> "It is those who believe and confuse not their beliefs with wrong - that are (truly) in security, for they are on (right) guidance."</li><li class="collection-item"> That was the reasoning about Us, which We gave to Abraham (to use) against his people: We raise whom We will, degree after degree: for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.</li><li class="collection-item"> We gave him Isaac and Jacob: all (three) guided: and before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron: thus do We reward those who do good:</li><li class="collection-item"> And Zakariya and John, and Jesus and Elias: all in the ranks of the righteous:</li><li class="collection-item"> And Isma´il and Elisha, and Jonas, and Lot: and to all We gave favour above the nations:</li><li class="collection-item"> (To them) and to their fathers, and progeny and brethren: We chose them, and we guided them to a straight way.</li><li class="collection-item"> This is the guidance of Allah: He giveth that guidance to whom He pleaseth, of His worshippers. If they were to join other gods with Him, all that they did would be vain for them.</li><li class="collection-item"> These were the men to whom We gave the Book, and authority, and prophethood: if these (their descendants) reject them, Behold! We shall entrust their charge to a new people who reject them not.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those were the (prophets) who received Allah´s guidance: Copy the guidance they received; Say: "No reward for this do I ask of you: This is no less than a message for the nations."</li><li class="collection-item"> No just estimate of Allah do they make when they say: "Nothing doth Allah send down to man (by way of revelation)" Say: "Who then sent down the Book which Moses brought?- a light and guidance to man: But ye make it into (separate) sheets for show, while ye conceal much (of its contents): therein were ye taught that which ye knew not- neither ye nor your fathers." Say: "Allah (sent it down)": Then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and trifling.</li><li class="collection-item"> And this is a Book which We have sent down, bringing blessings, and confirming (the revelations) which came before it: that thou mayest warn the mother of cities and all around her. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in this (Book), and they are constant in guarding their prayers.</li><li class="collection-item"> Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against Allah, or saith, "I have received inspiration," when he hath received none, or (again) who saith, "I can reveal the like of what Allah hath revealed"? If thou couldst but see how the wicked (do fare) in the flood of confusion at death! - the angels stretch forth their hands, (saying),"Yield up your souls: this day shall ye receive your reward,- a penalty of shame, for that ye used to tell lies against Allah, and scornfully to reject of His signs!"</li><li class="collection-item"> "And behold! ye come to us bare and alone as We created you for the first time: ye have left behind you all (the favours) which We bestowed on you: We see not with you your intercessors whom ye thought to be partners in your affairs: so now all relations between you have been cut off, and your (pet) fancies have left you in the lurch!"</li><li class="collection-item"> It is Allah Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth?</li><li class="collection-item"> He it is that cleaveth the day-break (from the dark): He makes the night for rest and tranquillity, and the sun and moon for the reckoning (of time): Such is the judgment and ordering of (Him), the Exalted in Power, the Omniscient.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who maketh the stars (as beacons) for you, that ye may guide yourselves, with their help, through the dark spaces of land and sea: We detail Our signs for people who know.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who hath produced you from a single person: here is a place of sojourn and a place of departure: We detail Our signs for people who understand.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who sendeth down rain from the skies: with it We produce vegetation of all kinds: from some We produce green (crops), out of which We produce grain, heaped up (at harvest); out of the date-palm and its sheaths (or spathes) (come) clusters of dates hanging low and near: and (then there are) gardens of grapes, and olives, and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety): when they begin to bear fruit, feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof. Behold! in these things there are signs for people who believe.</li><li class="collection-item"> Yet they make the Jinns equals with Allah, though Allah did create the Jinns; and they falsely, having no knowledge, attribute to Him sons and daughters. Praise and glory be to Him! (for He is) above what they attribute to Him!</li><li class="collection-item"> To Him is due the primal origin of the heavens and the earth: How can He have a son when He hath no consort? He created all things, and He hath full knowledge of all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> That is Allah, your Lord! there is no god but He, the Creator of all things: then worship ye Him: and He hath power to dispose of all affairs.</li><li class="collection-item"> No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> "Now have come to you, from your Lord, proofs (to open your eyes): if any will see, it will be for (the good of) his own soul; if any will be blind, it will be to his own (harm): I am not (here) to watch over your doings."</li><li class="collection-item"> Thus do we explain the signs by various (symbols): that they may say, "Thou hast taught (us) diligently," and that We may make the matter clear to those who know.</li><li class="collection-item"> Follow what thou art taught by inspiration from thy Lord: there is no god but He: and turn aside from those who join gods with Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> If it had been Allah´s plan, they would not have taken false gods: but We made thee not one to watch over their doings, nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs.</li><li class="collection-item"> Revile not ye those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they out of spite revile Allah in their ignorance. Thus have We made alluring to each people its own doings. In the end will they return to their Lord, and We shall then tell them the truth of all that they did.</li><li class="collection-item"> They swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that if a (special) sign came to them, by it they would believe. Say: "Certainly (all) signs are in the power of Allah: but what will make you (Muslims) realise that (even) if (special) signs came, they will not believe."?</li><li class="collection-item"> We (too) shall turn to (confusion) their hearts and their eyes, even as they refused to believe in this in the first instance: We shall leave them in their trespasses, to wander in distraction.</li><li class="collection-item"> Even if We did send unto them angels, and the dead did speak unto them, and We gathered together all things before their very eyes, they are not the ones to believe, unless it is in Allah´s plan. But most of them ignore (the truth).</li><li class="collection-item"> Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy,- evil ones among men and jinns, inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thy Lord had so planned, they would not have done it: so leave them and their inventions alone.</li><li class="collection-item"> To such (deceit) let the hearts of those incline, who have no faith in the hereafter: let them delight in it, and let them earn from it what they may.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Shall I seek for judge other than Allah? - when He it is Who hath sent unto you the Book, explained in detail." They know full well, to whom We have given the Book, that it hath been sent down from thy Lord in truth. Never be then of those who doubt.</li><li class="collection-item"> The word of thy Lord doth find its fulfilment in truth and in justice: None can change His words: for He is the one who heareth and knoweth all.</li><li class="collection-item"> Wert thou to follow the common run of those on earth, they will lead thee away from the way of Allah. They follow nothing but conjecture: they do nothing but lie.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thy Lord knoweth best who strayeth from His way: He knoweth best who they are that receive His guidance.</li><li class="collection-item"> So eat of (meats) on which Allah´s name hath been pronounced, if ye have faith in His signs.</li><li class="collection-item"> Why should ye not eat of (meats) on which Allah´s name hath been pronounced, when He hath explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you - except under compulsion of necessity? But many do mislead (men) by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Thy Lord knoweth best those who transgress.</li><li class="collection-item"> Eschew all sin, open or secret: those who earn sin will get due recompense for their "earnings."</li><li class="collection-item"> Eat not of (meats) on which Allah´s name hath not been pronounced: That would be impiety. But the evil ones ever inspire their friends to contend with you if ye were to obey them, ye would indeed be Pagans.</li><li class="collection-item"> Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a light whereby he can walk amongst men, be like him who is in the depths of darkness, from which he can never come out? Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thus have We placed leaders in every town, its wicked men, to plot (and burrow) therein: but they only plot against their own souls, and they perceive it not.</li><li class="collection-item"> When there comes to them a sign (from Allah), They say: "We shall not believe until we receive one (exactly) like those received by Allah´s messengers." Allah knoweth best where (and how) to carry out His mission. Soon will the wicked be overtaken by humiliation before Allah, and a severe punishment, for all their plots.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those whom Allah (in His plan) willeth to guide,- He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying,- He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah (heap) the penalty on those who refuse to believe.</li><li class="collection-item"> This is the way of thy Lord, leading straight: We have detailed the signs for those who receive admonition.</li><li class="collection-item"> For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord: He will be their friend, because they practised (righteousness).</li><li class="collection-item"> One day will He gather them all together, (and say): "O ye assembly of Jinns! Much (toll) did ye take of men." Their friends amongst men will say: "Our Lord! we made profit from each other: but (alas!) we reached our term - which thou didst appoint for us." He will say: "The Fire be your dwelling-place: you will dwell therein for ever, except as Allah willeth." for thy Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thus do we make the wrong-doers turn to each other, because of what they earn.</li><li class="collection-item"> "O ye assembly of Jinns and men! came there not unto you messengers from amongst you, setting forth unto you My signs, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?" They will say: "We bear witness against ourselves." It was the life of this world that deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected Faith.</li><li class="collection-item"> (The messengers were sent) thus, for thy Lord would not destroy for their wrong-doing men´s habitations whilst their occupants were unwarned.</li><li class="collection-item"> To all are degrees (or ranks) according to their deeds: for thy Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were His will, He could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom He will as your successors, even as He raised you up from the posterity of other people.</li><li class="collection-item"> All that hath been promised unto you will come to pass: nor can ye frustrate it (in the least bit).</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): soon will ye know who it is whose end will be (best) in the Hereafter: certain it is that the wrong-doers will not prosper."</li><li class="collection-item"> Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle, they assigned Him a share: they say, according to their fancies: "This is for Allah, and this" - for our "partners"! but the share of their" partners "reacheth not Allah, whilst the share of Allah reacheth their "partners" ! evil (and unjust) is their assignment!</li><li class="collection-item"> Even so, in the eyes of most of the pagans, their "partners" made alluring the slaughter of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction, and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed, they would not have done so: But leave alone them and their inventions.</li><li class="collection-item"> And they say that such and such cattle and crops are taboo, and none should eat of them except those whom - so they say - We wish; further, there are cattle forbidden to yoke or burden, and cattle on which, (at slaughter), the name of Allah is not pronounced; - inventions against Allah´s name: soon will He requite them for their inventions.</li><li class="collection-item"> They say: "What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is specially reserved (for food) for our men, and forbidden to our women; but if it is still-born, then all have share therein. For their (false) attribution (of superstitions to Allah), He will soon punish them: for He is full of wisdom and knowledge.</li><li class="collection-item"> Lost are those who slay their children, from folly, without knowledge, and forbid food which Allah hath provided for them, inventing (lies) against Allah. They have indeed gone astray and heeded no guidance.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who produceth gardens, with trellises and without, and dates, and tilth with produce of all kinds, and olives and pomegranates, similar (in kind) and different (in variety): eat of their fruit in their season, but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered. But waste not by excess: for Allah loveth not the wasters.</li><li class="collection-item"> Of the cattle are some for burden and some for meat: eat what Allah hath provided for you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan: for he is to you and avowed enemy.</li><li class="collection-item"> (Take) eight (head of cattle) in (four) pairs: of sheep a pair, and of goats a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? Tell me with knowledge if ye are truthful:</li><li class="collection-item"> Of camels a pair, and oxen a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? - Were ye present when Allah ordered you such a thing? But who doth more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead astray men without knowledge? For Allah guideth not people who do wrong.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "I find not in the message received by me by inspiration any (meat) forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be dead meat, or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine,- for it is an abomination - or, what is impious, (meat) on which a name has been invoked, other than Allah´s". But (even so), if a person is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- thy Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> For those who followed the Jewish Law, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them that fat of the ox and the sheep, except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or is mixed up with a bone: this in recompense for their wilful disobedience: for We are true (in Our ordinances).</li><li class="collection-item"> If they accuse thee of falsehood, say: "Your Lord is full of mercy all-embracing; but from people in guilt never will His wrath be turned back.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who give partners (to Allah) will say: "If Allah had wished, we should not have given partners to Him nor would our fathers; nor should we have had any taboos." So did their ancestors argue falsely, until they tasted of Our wrath. Say: "Have ye any (certain) knowledge? If so, produce it before us. Ye follow nothing but conjecture: ye do nothing but lie."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "With Allah is the argument that reaches home: if it had been His will, He could indeed have guided you all."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Bring forward your witnesses to prove that Allah did forbid so and so." If they bring such witnesses, be not thou amongst them: Nor follow thou the vain desires of such as treat our signs as falsehoods, and such as believe not in the Hereafter: for they hold others as equal with their Guardian-Lord.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Come, I will rehearse what Allah hath (really) prohibited you from": Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;- We provide sustenance for you and for them;- come not nigh to shameful deeds. Whether open or secret; take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> And come not nigh to the orphan´s property, except to improve it, until he attain the age of full strength; give measure and weight with (full) justice;- no burden do We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned; and fulfil the covenant of Allah: thus doth He command you, that ye may remember.</li><li class="collection-item"> Verily, this is My way, leading straight: follow it: follow not (other) paths: they will scatter you about from His (great) path: thus doth He command you. that ye may be righteous.</li><li class="collection-item"> Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing (Our favour) to those who would do right, and explaining all things in detail,- and a guide and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord.</li><li class="collection-item"> And this is a Book which We have revealed as a blessing: so follow it and be righteous, that ye may receive mercy:</li><li class="collection-item"> Lest ye should say: "The Book was sent down to two Peoples before us, and for our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned by assiduous study:"</li><li class="collection-item"> Or lest ye should say: "If the Book had only been sent down to us, we should have followed its guidance better than they." Now then hath come unto you a clear (sign) from your Lord,- and a guide and a mercy: then who could do more wrong than one who rejecteth Allah´s signs, and turneth away therefrom?

<p><strong>Name</strong><br>This Surah takes its name from vv. 136, 138 and 139 
in which some superstitious beliefs of the idolatrous Arabs concerning the 
lawfulness of some cattle (an`am) and the unlawfulness of some others have been 
refuted.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>According to a 
tradition of Ibn Abbas, the whole of the Surah was revealed at one sitting at 
Makkah. Asma, a daughter of Yazid and a first cousin of Hadrat Mu'az-bin Jabl, 
says, "During the revelation of this Surah, the Holy Prophet was riding on a 
she-camel and I was holding her nose-string. The she-camel began to feel the 
weight so heavily that it seemed as if her bones would break under it." We also 
learn from other traditions that the Holy Prophet dictated the whole of the 
Surah the same night that it was revealed.<br><br>Its subject-matter clearly 
shows that it must have been revealed during the last year of the Holy Prophet's 
life at Makkah. The tradition of Asma, daughter of Yazid, also confirms this. As 
she belonged to the Ansar and embraced Islam after the migration of the Holy 
Prophet to Yathrib, her visit to the Holy Prophet at Makkah must have taken 
place during the last year of his life there. For before this, his relations 
with those people were not so intimate that a woman from there might have come 
to visit him at Makkah.<br><br><strong>Occasion of Revelation</strong><br><br>
After determining the period of its revelation, it is easier to visualize the 
background of the Surah. Twelve years had passed since the Holy Prophet had been 
inviting the people to Islam. The antagonism and persecution by the Quraish had 
become most savage and brutal, and the majority of the Muslims had to leave 
their homes and migrate to Habash (Abyssinia). Above all, the two great 
supporters of the Holy Prophet. Abu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah, were no more to 
help and give strength to him. Thus he was deprived of all the worldly support. 
But in spite of this, he carried on his mission in the teeth of opposition. As a 
result of this, on the one hand, all the good people of Makkah and the 
surrounding clans gradually began to accept Islam ; on the other hand, the 
community as a whole, was bent upon obduracy and rejection. Therefore, if anyone 
showed any inclination towards Islam, he was subjected to taunts and derision, 
physical violence and social boycott. It was in these dark circumstances that a 
ray of hope gleamed from Yathrib, where Islam began to spread freely by the 
efforts of some influential people of Aus and Khazraj, who had embraced Islam at 
Makkah. This was a humble beginning in the march of Islam towards success and 
none could foresee at that time the great potentialities that lay hidden in it. 
For, to a casual observer, it appeared at that time as if Islam was merely a 
weak movement it had no material backing except the meager support of the 
Prophet's own family and of the few poor adherents of the Movement. Obviously 
the latter could not give much help because they themselves had been cast out by 
their own people who had become their enemies and were persecuting them.<br><br>
<strong>Topics</strong><br><br>These were the conditions, when this discourse 
was revealed. The main topics dealt with in this discourse may be divided under 
seven headings:<br><br>Refutation of shirk and invitation to the creed of Tauhid.<br>
<br>Enunciation of the doctrine of the "Life-after- death." and refutation of 
the wrong notion that there was nothing beyond this worldly life.<br><br>
Refutation of the prevalent superstitions.<br><br>Enunciation of the fundamental 
moral principles for the building up of the Islamic Society.<br><br>Answers to 
the objections raised against the person of the Holy Prophet and his mission.<br>
<br>Comfort and encouragement to the Holy Prophet and his followers who were at, 
that time in a state of anxiety and despondency because of the apparent failure 
of the mission.<br><br>Admonition, warning and threats to the disbelievers and 
opponents to give up their apathy and haughtiness. It must, however, be noted 
that the above topics have not been dealt with one by one under separate 
headings, but the discourse goes on as a continuous whole and these topics come 
under discussion over and over again in new and different ways.<br><br>The 
Background of Makki Surahs<br><br>As this is the first long Makki Surah in the 
order of the compilation of the Quran, it will be useful to explain the 
historical background of Makki Surahs in general, so that the reader may easily 
understand the Makki Surahs and our references to its different stages in 
connection with our commentary on them.<br><br>First of all, it should be noted 
that comparatively very little material is available in regard to the background 
of the revelation of Makki Surahs whereas the period of the revelation of all 
the Madani Surahs is known or can be determined with a little effort. There are 
authentic traditions even in regard to the occasions of the revelation of the 
majority of the verses. On the other hand, we do not have such detailed 
information regarding the Makki Surahs. There are only a few Surahs and verses 
which have authentic traditions concerning the time and occasion of their 
revelation. This is because the history of the Makki period had not been 
compiled in such detail as that of the Madani period. Therefore we have to 
depend on the internal evidence of these Surahs for determining the period of 
their revelation: for example, the topics they discuss, their subject. matter, 
their style and the direct or indirect references to the events and the 
occasions of their revelation. Thus it is obvious that with the help of such 
evidence as this, we cannot say with precision that such and such Surah or verse 
was revealed on such and such an occasion. The most we can do is to compare the 
internal evidence of a Surah with the events of the life of the Holy Prophet at 
Makkah, and then come to a more or less correct conclusion as to what particular 
stage a certain Surah belongs.<br><br>If we keep the above things in view, the 
history of the mission of the Holy Prophet at Makkah can be divided into four 
stages.<br><br>The first stage began with his appointment as a Messenger and 
ended with the proclamation of Prophethood three years later. During this period 
the Message was given secretly to some selected persons only, but the common 
people of Makkah were not aware of it.<br><br>The second stage lasted for two 
years after the proclamation of his Prophethood. It began with opposition by 
individuals: then by and by, it took the shape of antagonism, ridicule, 
derision,, accusation, abuse, and false propaganda then gangs were formed to 
persecute those Muslims who were comparatively poor, weak' and helpless.<br><br>
The third stage lasted for about six years from the beginning of the persecution 
to the death of Abu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah in the tenth year of Prophethood. 
During this period, the persecution of the Muslims became' so savage and brutal 
that many of them were forced to migrate to Habash. Social and economic boycott 
was applied against the Holy Prophet and the members of his family, and those 
Muslims who continued to stay in Makkah were forced to take refuge in Shi'b-i-A'bi 
Talib which was besieged.<br><br>The fourth stage lasted for about three years 
from the tenth to the thirteenth year of Prophethood. This was a period of hard 
trials and grievous sufferings for the Holy Prophet and his followers. Life had 
become unendurable at Makkah and there appeared to be no place of refuge even 
outside it. So much so that when the Holy Prophet went to Ta'if, it offered no 
shelter or protection. Besides this, on the occasion of Haj, he would appeal to 
each and every Arab clan to accept his invitation to Islam but met with blank 
refusal from every quarter. At the same time, the people of Makkah were holding 
counsels' to get rid of him by killing or imprisoning or banishing him from 
their city. It was at that most critical time that Allah opened for Islam the 
hearts of the Ansar of Yathrab where he migrated at their invitation.<br><br>Now 
that we have divided the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah into four stages, it 
has become easier for us to tell, as far as possible, the particular stage in 
which a certain Makki Sarah was revealed. This is because the Surahs belonging 
to a particular stage can be distinguished from those of the other stages with 
the help of their subject matter and style. Besides this, they also contain such 
references as throw light on the circumstances and events that form the 
background of their revelation. In the succeeding Makki Surahs, we will 
determine on the basis of the distinctive features of each stage, and point out 
in the Preface, the particular stage in which a certain Makki Surah was 
revealed.<br><br><strong>Subject :Islamic Creed.</strong><br><br>This Surah 
mainly discusses the different aspects of the major articles of the Islamic 
Creed: Tauhid, Life-after-death, Prophethood and their practical application to 
human life. Side by side with this, it refutes the erroneous beliefs of the 
"opponents and answers their objections, warns and admonishes them and comforts 
the Holy Prophet and his followers, who were then suffering from persecution.<br>
<br>Of course, these themes have not been dealt with under separate heads but 
have been blended in an excellent manner.<br><br><strong>Topics and their 
Interconnection</strong><br><br>These verses are of introductory and admonitory 
nature. The disbelievers have been warned that if they do not accept the Islamic 
Creed and follow the 'Light' shown by the Revelation from the All-Knowing and 
All-Powerful Allah, they would go to the same doom as the former disbelievers 
did. Their arguments for rejecting the Prophet and the Revelation sent down to 
him have been refuted and a warning has been given to them that they should not 
be deluded by the respite that is being granted to them. 1 - 12<br><br>These 
verses inculcate Tauhid, and refute shirk which is the greatest obstacle in the 
way of its acceptance. 13 - 24<br><br>In these verses, a graphic scene of the 
life in the Hereafter has been depicted in order to warn the disbelievers of the 
consequences of the rejection of the Articles of Faith. 25 - 32<br><br>
Prophethood is the main theme which has been discussed from the point of view of 
the Holy Prophet, his Mission, the limitations of his powers, the attitude 
towards his followers and also from the point of view of the disbelievers. 33 - 
73<br><br>In continuation of the same theme, the story of Prophet Abraham has 
been related to bring home to the pagan Arabs that the Mission of Prophet 
Muhammad, which they were opposing, was the same as that of Prophet Abraham 
(Allah's peace be upon them). This line of argument was adopted because they 
considered themselves to be his followers, especially the Quraish who were proud 
of being his descendants as well. 74 - 90<br><br>Another proof of his 
Prophethood is the Book, which has been sent down to him by Allah, for its 
teachings show the right guidance in regard to creed and practice. 91 - 108<br>
<br>Divine restrictions have been contrasted with the superstitious restrictions 
of the pagan Arabs in order to show the striking differences between the two and 
thus prove the Quran to be a Revealed Book. 109 - 154<br><br>The Jews, who were 
criticized in vv. 144 - 147 along with the pagan Arabs, have been urged to 
compare the teachings of the Quran with those of the Torah so that they might 
recognize their similarity and give up their lame excuses against it, and adopt 
its Guidance to escape the retribution on the Day of Resurrection. 155 - 160<br>
<br>This is the conclusion of the discourse: the Holy Prophet has been 
instructed in a beautiful and forceful manner to proclaim fearlessly the 
articles of the Islamic Creed and their implications. 161 - 165</p>
<hr>
<p>It should be noted that the addressees were the mushrik Arabs, who 
acknowledged that the Creator of the earth and heavens and of the sun and the 
moon is Allah, who brought about the day and night. None of them believed that 
these were the works of Lat or Hubal or `Uzza or of any other god or goddess. 
Therefore Allah admonished them, saying (so to speak), "O foolish people, when 
you yourselves admit that the Creator of the heavens and earth and of the night 
and day, is Allah, why do you, then, make others your gods, and prostrate before 
them, make offerings to them, present your needs before them and invoke them for 
help`" (Refer to E.N.2 of Al-Fatihah and E.N. 163, Al-Baqarah).<br><br>It may be 
noted that Zulumat (plural of Zu1mat) has been used in contrast to nur (light, 
singular form). It is because 'darkness is merely the absence of light and may 
be of many kinds. <br><br>2Allah says that He has created man from "earth" 
because each and every particle of the human body comes from the earth and from 
nowhere else.<br><br>3"The other settled term" is the "Day of Resurrection", 
when all human beings will be brought back to life and presented before Allah 
for rendering the account of their life on the earth.<br><br>4The reference is 
to the "news" of the successes that were to follow the emigration of the Holy 
Prophet to Madinah. At the time of this revelation, neither the disbelievers nor 
the Believers could ever imagine the nature of the "news" they were going to 
receive. So much so that even the Holy Prophet himself was unaware of the kind 
of successes the Muslims were going to achieve in the near future.<br><br>5The 
ignorant objectors argued that if Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was 
really a Messenger from Allah, an angel ought to have come down from heaven to 
declare to the people: "This is the Messenger of Allah, so obey him; otherwise 
you shall be punished".<br><br>The ignorant objectors did not understand how the 
Creator of the heavens and earth could leave His Messenger in such a plight as 
to be maligned and stoned by his enemies. They argued that the Messenger of such 
a Supreme Sovereign ought to have come with a large retinue or at least an angel 
in attendance on him, to protect him from his enemies and to fill the people 
with awe and to convince them of his Prophethood and to carry out his orders in 
some supernatural ways. <br><br>6The first answer to their objection is that in 
case Allah had sent down an angel, no respite would have been given them for 
reforming themselves and mending their ways. They have been given a chance 
because no angel has been sent to make the Reality so naked as to leave no 
alternative for them but to believe. It is obvious that this would have defeated 
the very purpose of their life in the world to undergo their test. That is why 
no angel has been sent. Man should undergo his test and discover the unseen 
Reality without actually seeing it, merely by the right use of his reasoning and 
thinking powers, and then bring under control his own self and its lusts in 
accordance with the dictates of that Reality. It is thus obvious that the 
"Unseen" must remain unseen for the sake of that test.<br><br>The worldly life, 
the period of that test, will remain so only as long as the "Unseen" remains 
unseen. No sooner will the "Unseen" become evident than that "Period" will 
automatically come to an end, and instead of test, it will be the time of the 
result of the test. Therefore Allah is not granting your demand for an angel to 
appear before you because Allah does not like to end the term of your test 
before the expiry of the period of the test. (Refer also to E.N. 228, Al-Baqarah).<br>
<br>7The only other alternative was to send an angel in human form. Allah says 
that if He had sent an angel in human form, they would have felt the same 
difficulty in recognizing him as they were feeling in recognizing Muhammad 
(Allah's peace be upon him). This, too, would have involved them in doubts. 
Therefore it was for their own good that Allah had not sent an angel in 
attendance on His Messenger.<br><br>8That is, those, who ridicule the Message, 
should travel through the land and see the remains, and study the history of the 
former peoples. These will bear witness to the horrible end of those who behaved 
in the way they are behaving towards Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him).<br>
<br>9It is a nice way of cornering the mushrikin. At first Allah tells His 
Messenger to ask them, "Whose is all that is in the heavens and the earth?" The 
questioner put the question and waited for an answer. But they kept silent 
because their answer could neither be in the negative nor in the affirmative. 
They could not deny this because they themselves believed that `all belongs to 
Allah.' But they could not affirm this because in that case, they themselves 
would have supplied the adversary with an argument against their own creed of 
shirk. After putting them in this critical position, Allah enjoined His 
Messenger to say, "All belongs to Allah." <br><br>10This contains a subtle 
argument: all those, whom the mushrikin have made their gods besides Allah, 
stand in need of nourishment from their devotees, not to speak of giving 
nourishment to them. No Pharaoh can set up his grandeur unless his subjects pay 
taxes and make offerings to him; no saint becomes worthy of worship, unless his 
worshipers build a grand mausoleum for him; no god becomes a god unless his 
devotees make his idol and set it up in a grand temple and decorate it with 
ornamentation. Thus, all the artificial gods stand in need of their servants. It 
is the Lord of the universe alone, Who does not stand in need of anyone's help 
but all others stand in need of Him, and it is His Godhead alone that does not 
stand in need of any prop from anyone whatsoever, but supports itself.<br><br>
11That is. "Allah is a witness that I have been appointed a Messenger by Him and 
whatever I say is from Him." <br><br>12Mere guess-work or speculation does not 
suffice for testifying to anything: none can testify to a thing with certainty 
without the necessary knowledge about it. The question implies: "Do you really 
have the knowledge that there is any other Sovereign with authority than Allah, 
Who is worthy of service and worship?" <br><br>13That is, "You may, if you so 
like, give false testimony without any knowledge, but, as for me, I cannot give 
such a testimony." <br><br>14It means that those, who possess the knowledge of 
revealed Books, know it for certain that there is only One God, Who has no 
partner in His Godhead. Therefore they can discern the right creed about Allah 
from among many different kinds of other creeds' and theories about Godhead, 
just as any person can identify his own child from among many thousands of other 
children. <br><br>15"False allegation" is the claim that there are many other 
partners with Allah in His Godhead who have divine attributes and powers and are 
thus worthy of worship. It is also false to allege that Allah Himself has made 
such and such His special courtiers and has enjoined (or at least approved) that 
Divine attributes should be ascribed to them and that they should be treated 
with reverence, like Allah. <br><br>16"Allah's Signs" are all those signs that 
point to the fact that there is only One God in the universe and that all others 
are His servants. These signs are spread all over the universe. They are found 
in the person of man himself and in the character and the great achievements of 
the Prophets and in the revealed Books. That is why the one, who, in the 
presence of all these "Signs," ascribes Divine attributes to others and 
considers them worthy of Divine rights, is in fact guilty of gross iniquity. It 
is indeed a great injustice that one should ascribe such Divine attributes to 
others without any evidence, knowledge, observation and experience merely on the 
basis of guess-work or the traditions of the forefathers. As a result of this 
false creed, he does injustice to Truth, to Reality, to his own self and to 
everything and everyone he deals with in this universe.<br><br>17Here Allah has 
ascribed to Himself the cause of the defects produced in their faculties of 
understanding, hearing and seeing, for everything that takes place in the world 
under the Natural Law does, in fact, take place by the command of Allah because 
He is the Author of that Law. Therefore the resultant effects of the working of 
that Law, in fact, take place by the will and order of Allah. The obdurate 
disbelievers do not understand, do not hear and do not see the Truth, even 
though they seem to listen to the Message of the Messenger, because their 
obduracy, their prejudice and their unwillingness have, according to the law of 
Nature, dulled their faculties. The law is that if one is bent upon obduracy and 
does not adopt the attitude of a righteous person, all the doors of his heart 
automatically get locked against every kind of trth that goes against his lusts. 
When this natural process is described in the human language, it will be said, 
"The doors of the heart of such and such a person are locked." But God, without 
Whose Command and Leave nothing whatsoever can happen, will describe the same 
like this, "We have locked the doors of the heart of such and such a person." 
This is because a human being will describe the thing as it seems to happen, 
whereas Allah states the true nature of the happening. <br><br>18This is the 
excuse that the foolish people put forward for rejecting the Message. They say, 
"There is nothing new in the Message towards which the Messenger is inviting us. 
This is the same old Message that we have been hearing before." According to 
these foolish people, in order to be true, a Message must also be new because 
according to them that which is old cannot be we. Whereas the fact is that the 
Message has always been one and the same and will ever remain so. The Messengers 
of Allah, who had been coming from the earliest times for the guidance of 
mankind, have always been communicating the same Message; likewise, the Holy 
Prophet was also presenting the same old Message. Of course, only those, who 
being devoid of Divine Light, cannot see the aforesaid eternal reality, might 
invent something new and by forging some theories present them as truth, saying, 
"We have a new Message, which has never been given by anyone before us." <br>
<br>19Their desire, that, if they could return to this world again, they would 
believe in the Message, will not be the outcome of any right thinking and 
reasoning or any real change of their hearts and minds, but will be the result 
of witnessing the Reality after which even the most obdurate disbeliever dare 
not deny it.<br><br>20This does not mean that the life in this world is not real 
and earnest and has been created merely for sport and pastime without any 
serious purpose. What it means is that compared with the everlasting life in the 
Hereafter, the short transitory life in this world is like sport and pastime, 
which are diversions from serious work, to which one has to return after 
recreation. Moreover, this worldly life has been likened to sport and pastime, 
because here are many things of deceptive appearances that are liable to involve 
in misunderstanding those people, who lack common-sense and vision, and help 
them assume false positions so as to make life mere sport and pastime. For 
instance, the role of a ruler in this worldly life is, in fact, not any 
different from that of an actor who plays the role of a king on the stage, wears 
a crown and gives commands which are obeyed like those of a real king; whereas, 
in fact, he has no powers of a real king and is deposed, imprisoned and killed 
by the order of the director; likewise many other such dramas are being 
performed on the stage of this world day and night all around us. There is `the 
court' of a `saint' or a goddess, where the needs are being "fulfilled", 
whereas, in fact, that `court' has no such power. Then there is another actor 
who performs the feats of divining the unseen and the future; whereas, in fact, 
none possesses such knowledge. Still another poses to be the nourisher of 
others, when in fact, he himself stands in need of obtaining provisions from 
others. There is still another who poses as if he has the power of bestowing 
honor and benefit or of inflicting disgrace and loss and behaves arrogantly as 
if he were the absolute master of all around him. In fact, he himself is utterly 
powerless and helpless, for a little turn of fortune can dethrone him from the 
high pedestal of greatness to the lowest depths of disgrace. So much so that he 
might even be at the feet of those very people, over whom he was ruling as a 
despot. All these dramas that are being played on the stage of life are abruptly 
brought to an end by death. Then everyone will cross over to the other world and 
see for himself everything in its true color; then all the misunderstandings of 
the life of this world shall be removed and everyone will be shown the real 
worth of what he had earned for the Life-after-death<br><br>21The fact is that 
all the people of his tribe regarded the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be 
peace) truthful and honest up to the time he had not begun to recite the 
Revelations of Allah before them. They falsified him only when he began to 
deliver to them the Message of Allah. Even then, there was none who dared charge 
Muhammad, the Man, with falsehood; nay, even his bitterest enemies never accused 
him of having ever told a lie concerning any worldly matter. It was Muhammad, 
the Prophet, whom they charged with falsehood. So much so that even Abu Jahl, 
who was the bitterest of all his enemies never accused him of falsehood. 
According to a tradition related by Hadrat 'Ali, Abu Jahl himself declared 
during a conversation with the Holy Prophet, "We do not call you a liar; but 
regard as false what you are presenting. " On the occasion of the Battle of Badr, 
Akhnas bin Shariq asked Abu Jahl in private, "There is no third person here 
besides us two. Tell me the truth whether you regard Muhammad as a truthful man 
or as a liar." He answered, "By God, Muhammad is a truthful person and has never 
told a lie in his life, but if Bani Qusayy, who have already the privilege of 
being the bearers of the national flag and the providers of water to the 
pilgrims and the keepers of the keys of the Ka bah, should also be acknowledged 
as the recipients of Prophethood, what would then be left for the rest of the 
Quraish?" For this very reason Allah is comforting His Prophet, saying, "It is 
not you whom they are rejecting as an impostor but it is Our Message which they 
are rejecting; when We are forbearing everything and giving them respite after 
respite, why should you show any kind of anxiety'?" <br><br>22The "Law" referred 
to here is the Law of Allah concerning the conflict between the right and the 
wrong. According to this Law, it is essential that the righteous should be tried 
for along period to stand their test in order to prove their fortitude, their 
righteousness, their spirit of sacrifice and their fidelity, their limn belief 
in their Faith and their complete trust in Allah. For this they must pass 
through afflictions and hardships in order to develop those high moral qualities 
which can be learned only by going through this hard and tough course, for with 
these weapons alone, they are required to win the battle against falsehood. 
When, according to this Law, they prove their competence, then will Allah's help 
come at the right moment to support them and this help cannot be brought about 
before its time by anyone. <br><br>23Whenever the Holy Prophet felt that his 
people did not accept the Message in spite of his continuous preaching, he 
cherished the desire that Allah Might send such a clear Sign that they should 
have no alternative left but to accept his Message. In this verse Allah has 
admonished His Messenger against cherishing any such desire, so as to say, "Do 
not show impatience at their obduracy, but go on performing your mission 
persistently in the way and order We are laying down for it. If this mission had 
to be performed by means of miracles, could We not Ourselves have done so? But 
We know that this method is not suitable for bringing about that intellectual 
and moral revolution and for the establishment of that righteous society for 
which you have been appointed a Messenger. If, however, you cannot endure the 
heart-burning caused by their indifference and rejection and if you imagine that 
a tangible Sign, that might appeal to them, is required to break this inert 
state of their minds, then you should yourself try to bring about such a Sign: 
you may, if you can, go deep down into the bowels of the earth or ascend up to 
the heavens for this purpose, but you should not expect from Us that We would 
fulfill this desire of yours, for there is no room for it in Our scheme." <br>
<br>24This is to impress that it is not the purpose of Allah that all human 
beings should be forced to accept the Guidance somehow or other. Had it been so, 
He would have created them in such a way that they would have been righteous by 
birth like angels. Then there would have been no need of sending the Prophets 
and the Books and of making the Believers enter into a conflict with the 
disbelievers for the gradual establishment of the Way of Allah. But Allah does 
not desire this. On the contrary, He intends that the Truth should be presented 
to the people in a rational way so that those, who are convinced of it, may 
adopt it without any coercion, and then mold their characters in accordance with 
it to prove their moral superiority over the disbelievers. In this way they 
would go on attracting the best among the people towards it till they succeeded 
in establishing the Way by virtue of their high ideals, best principles of life, 
pure characters and strong arguments and with resolute struggle with the 
disbelievers. Then Allah assures them of the guidance and help they need and 
deserve at any stage. But if one wishes that, instead of this natural process, 
Allah should adopt some supernatural method and eradicate false ideas from the 
minds of the people and bring in pure ones instead and establish the righteous 
civilization in place of the evil ones, he should know that Allah will not do 
this for this will be against the wisdom of the scheme of His creation of Man. 
He has created Man as a responsible being granted him powers to exploit the 
things of the world and given him the freedom of action-both good and evil-and 
granted him a definite term for the preparation of the test and fixed the time 
for the declaration of the result of the test to punish or reward him according 
to his efforts.<br><br>25"Those, who listen to it... " are the people whose 
conscience is alive, who try to judge rationally between right and wrong, and 
who do not deliberately and obdurately lock the doors of their hearts. "Those 
who are dead..." are the people who blindly follow a way and are not ready to 
leave it and follow any other way even though that may manifestly be the Right 
Way.<br><br>26''Sign" means a tangible miracle. Allah says that the reason why 
he is not showing a Sign is not that He is unable to do so but for another 
reason whose wisdom they do not understand. (See E.N. 6). <br><br>27That is, "If 
you are really serious in your demand of seeing a Sign in order to judge whether 
the Message of this Prophet is true or false, you should see and ponder over the 
innumerable Signs that are found in abundance all around you. For instance, if 
you consider animal life, you will see that the structure of the bodies of each 
species of birds and beasts suits its functions immensely well; the qualities 
and characteristics that have been ingrained in its nature help to fulfill all 
its needs; the provision of its nourishment has been arranged in a wonderful 
way; and the course of its life has been so predetermined that it cannot 
transgress its limits in any way whatever. Allah also sees that each and every 
animal, nay, even the smallest insect, is being looked after, protected and 
guided, wherever it be, for the performance of the functions pre-destined for 
it. In short, you will find that its structure suits it well; it has been given 
inherent powers that help provide its needs: excellent provisions have been made 
for its food. The process of its birth, procreation and death has been going on 
according to a regulated fixed scheme. If you give a careful consideration to 
this Sign alone, you will realize that the teachings of this Prophet about the 
Oneness of God and His attributes and the way of life based on these to which he 
invites you are absolutely we. Yet you neither try to see with open eyes these 
Signs nor listen to the Message this Prophet is conveying to you. As a result, 
you have been involved in ignorance and, therefore, desire to see some wonderful 
miracle for mere pastime. " <br><br>28This is how Allah lets them go astray: (1) 
He holds back the opportunity for observing His Signs from the one who chooses 
to remain in ignorance; (2) He keeps hidden the pointers to the Reality from the 
one who is a victim of prejudices, even though he should see His Signs, and lets 
him remain involved in misunderstandings and move farther and farther away from 
the Reality. On the contrary, He guides the seeker after truth to the Right Way 
by affording him the opportunity to make use of his knowledge for the purpose of 
discovering the Reality, and showing him the signs guiding towards it. We daily 
notice instances of these types. There are millions of people before whose eyes 
countless Signs are spread in their own persons and in the universe, but they 
see them like animals and do not learn any lessons from them. Then there are the 
physicists, chemists, zoologists, botanists, biologists, geologists, 
astronomers, physiologist, anatomists, historians, archaeologists, social 
scientists, etc., who observe such Signs as may enlighten the minds and the 
hearts with Faith, but they seem to see no "Sign" to lead them to the Reality, 
just because they begin their study with prejudiced minds, merely for the sake 
of material gains. Not only this, but every Sign leads them to atheism, 
disbelief, materialism and nature worship. In contrast to them, there are those, 
who observe the wonders of the universe and the phenomena of Nature with open 
eyes and open hearts, and find the Signs of God all round them: SO much so that 
they can see His Sign in each and every green leaf. <br><br>29In answer to the 
demand of the disbelievers for a Sign, they were told that there was not one 
Sign, but innumerable Signs scattered all around them and their attention has 
been drawn in v. 38 to study the mystery of the life of any bird or beast and 
they would find Sign of God. Now in v. 40-42, they have been directed to another 
Sign that they can fmd in their own selves. When some affliction befalls a man 
or death confronts him with all its dreads, then he sees no refuge in any other 
than Allah. On such occasions even the most confirmed polytheists forget their 
gods and invoke Allah's help. Likewise the most obdurate atheists, in their 
utter helplessness, involuntary pray to Allah for rescue, this Sign-man's own 
state of mind is being presented here as a pointer to the Reality, for this is a 
clear proof of the existence of One God, and of the urge of God-worship that has 
been embedded deep in the heart of every human being. Though it might have been 
kept suppressed by negligence and ignorance, sometimes it comes to the surface 
under the stimulus of some misfortune.<br><br>Ikrimah, son of Abu Jahl, who was 
an arch enemy of Islam, was led towards Islam by witnessing such a Sign. When 
the Holy Prophet conquered Makkah, 'Ikrimah fled to Jaddah and sailed for 
Abyssinia. During the voyage, there came a furious storm which threatened to 
sink the boat. At first the passengers began to invoke their gods and goddesses 
for help. But when the storm became so violent that they feared that the boat 
was going to sink. they all cried out, "This is not the time to call any open 
except Allah, because He alone can save us. " This opened the eyes of `Ikrimah 
and the locked doors of his heart: "If there is none here except Allah to help 
us, how can there be any to help us in any other place? This is what Muhammad 
(Allah's peace be upon him) has been teaching us for the last twenty years any 
we have been fighting it out with him". That as the most decisive moment in the 
life of `Ikrimah. He made a solemn pledge with Allah to this effect: "If I 
escape from this storm, I will directly go to Prophet Muhammad Allah's peace be 
upon him) to become a follower of his." Allah rescued him from that storm and he 
fulfilled his pledge. He not only became a Muslim, but spent the rest of his 
life in the service of Islam by performing Jihad.<br><br>30"... and set a seal 
upon your hearts" means" ...deprive you of the powers of thinking and 
understanding.<br><br>31This verse removes the silly notions about Prophethood 
and answers the absurd objections raised against the claim of Prophethood by 
Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). The foolish people have always had the 
silly notion that a Prophet of Allah must be supernatural and capable of 
performing wonderful miracles. For instance, they expected that a whole mountain 
should turn into a mass of gold at his bidding: that the earth should throw out 
treasures by his orders: that he should be able to tell the people all about 
their past and future: that he should be able to locate a lost thing and 
foretell whether a sick person will get well or die and whether a pregnant woman 
will give birth to a male or a female. They also believed that such a person 
should be above the common human limitations. They could not conceive anyone to 
be a prophet, if he suffered from hunger or thirst and needed sleep, or, if he 
had wife and children and went to the bazaar to buy and sell the necessities of 
life, or, if he was sometimes forced to borrow money or was involved in poverty 
and indigence.<br><br>When Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) put forward the 
claim that he was a Messenger of Allah, his contemporaries wanted to test his 
claim with the touch-stone of such silly notions. They would ask him questions 
about the unseen things and demand supernatural miracles from him. They would 
also raise the objection that he was merely a common man, who needed food and 
drank water like them: who had wife and children and who moved about in the 
bazaars. In answer to these things, Allah told His Prophet to inform them that 
he never claimed to be supernatural; his only claim was that he was following 
the Revelations he received from Allah and that he should be judged by that 
standard only. <br><br>32The question is meant to bring home to them this fact: 
"I have seen with my own eyes and experienced directly the realities I am 
presenting to you, and I have gained their accurate knowledge through 
Revelation; therefore my evidence is that of an eye witness. On the contrary, 
you are blind with regard to those realities: all your notions concerning them 
are based on guess-work and speculation or on the blind following of others. 
Therefore the difference between you and me is the same as of the man who is 
able to see and the one who is blind. That is what gives me superiority over you 
and not that I possess the treasures of God or have the knowledge of the unseen 
or that I am free from the common human limitations."<br><br>33That is, "You 
should pay special attention only to those who believe that One Day they shall 
have to go before Allah to render an account of their deeds and who do not 
cherish any such false hopes that somebody's intercession and help will save 
them. It is because this "Admonition" can produce good effect only on such 
people and not on those who are so absorbed in the enjoyment of the pleasures of 
this world that they never think of their death or of going before Allah. 
Likewise, this "Admonition" will fall flat on those who are making merry in this 
world, deluding themselves into believing that no harm will come to them in the 
Hereafter because of their `spiritual' relation with such and such a saint or 
because such and such a holy person will intercede with Allah in their behalf or 
because such a one has already made atonement for them. Obviously, no admonition 
can be beneficial to such people." <br><br>34In this passage Allah has answered 
one of the objections that me big chiefs of the Quraish used to raise in regard 
to the followers of the Holy Prophet. They would say that none but the lowest 
stratum of society, consisting of slaves, menials and the like, had accepted 
Islam: they would taunt him of having such companions as Bilal, `Ammar, Suhaib, 
Khabbab, etc., and ask in a jeering way, "Are these the only (honorable) people 
from amongst us, upon whom Allah has showered His blessings?" They did not rest 
content with making fun of their poor condition, but also passed stinging 
remarks about their past shortcomings, saying. "Just have a look at the past 
history of such and such people, who are today forming the "pious" group of the 
believers." Allah has advised His Prophet not to be disheartened by their unkind 
remarks. <br><br>35That is, "If they had done something wrong in the past, they 
themselves shall be accountable for it and not you, for everyone shall get the 
reward of the good or evil one has done. Therefore, no good deed of yours will 
be put to their credit, nor will you be burdened with any evil deed of theirs. 
They come to you merely as seekers after truth and it will be injustice to look 
down upon them and drive them away."<br><br>36That is, "By bestowing the 
blessing of Islam at the outset on the poor and indigent and those who held a 
low position in society, We have involved the upper rich and proud class in 
trial."<br><br>37Allah has told his Messenger to console those of His followers 
who had committed heinous sins during the days of "ignorance" by inspiring them 
with the assurance that He forgives and treats leniently those who repent and 
mend their ways and, therefore, the taunts of the enemies of Islam need not 
worry them about what they had done in the past.<br><br>38In order to understand 
the significance of v. 55, we should keep in view v. 37 in which the 
disbelievers asked, "Why has no Sign been sent down to this Prophet from his 
Lord?" In the subsequent passage (vv. 38-54) several manifest Signs have been 
cited to show that there is no lack of Signs but the disbelievers do not want to 
see them. Then in v. 55 such people have been warned, as if to say, "In this way 
We make Our Signs clear, plain and manifest so that those, who persist in their 
disbelief inspire of those Signs, should prove themselves to be guilty ones. For 
they choose the way of deviation deliberately, not because there is a lack of 
Signs to show the Right Way but because they do not want to see the Signs."<br>
<br>39This alludes to the demand of the opponents for the scourge of Allah with 
which they were being threatened. They said, "Why does a scourge not come down 
upon us, when we are openly denying and defying you? If you have been really 
sent by Allah, then anyone, who denied and insulted you, would have been 
swallowed by the earth or stricken dead by lightning. How is it that the 
Messenger of Allah and his followers are undergoing untold afflictions and 
sufferings, while their tormentors are enjoying their lives merrily?"<br><br>
40Angels who keep strict watch over each and everything a man does or thinks of 
and maintain a complete record of all this. <br><br>41That is, "You yourselves 
are a witness that Allah alone is All-Powerful: He alone has the sole authority 
and your prosperity and adversity wholly lie in His power and He alone is the 
maker of your destinies. That is why you turn to Him in your affliction, when 
you find that no other means of rescue has been left for you. In the face of 
this clear Sign, you have set up, without any reason or rhyme, others as 
partners in His Godhead. You live on His provisions but treat others as your 
providers: you get help from Him in your need, but set up others as your helpers 
and protectors: He rescues you from your distress, yet you regard others 
(besides Him) as your rescuers: it is He Whom you humbly invoke in your 
affliction, yet you take your offerings to others when he removes it. In short, 
you witness the proofs of His Godhead, day and night, yet you serve and bow down 
before others.<br><br>42It is a warning to those who had become very bold in 
their enmity with the Truth because no scourge from Allah was in sight. They are 
being warned that the scourge of Allah does not take long to come. A gust of 
wind can destroy them all at once. A sudden shake of an earthquake can sink 
their Habitations under ground. A spark can set on fire the magazines of enmity 
and involve clans, nations and countries in endless blood feuds. Therefore, "If 
no scourge is coming on you, this should not make you so bold and neglectful as 
to go on treading blindly the way you are following without discerning whether 
it is right or wrong. Instead you should take advantage of the respite that is 
being given and of the Signs that are being presented to you and recognize the 
Reality and follow the Right Way."<br><br>43That is, "It is no part of my duty 
to make you see what you would not see and to make you understand what you would 
not understand; nor am I responsible for bringing down a scourge on you, if you 
would not see or understand it. The only duty that has been assigned to me is to 
make plain to you the distinction between Truth and falsehood. Now that I have 
done my duty and you have rejected the Truth, the evil consequences of which I 
have been warning you will appear in due course." <br><br>44That is, "If you 
ever forget this instruction and keep sitting in the company of such people."
<br><br>45Here very important practical instructions have been given to the 
pious people. Their first and foremost duty is to save themselves from any 
disobedience of Allah; they should not worry unnecessarily about the disobedient 
people, for they are not responsible for their disobedience. They should not, 
therefore, impose it upon themselves as an obligation that they have to convince 
them anyhow by argument and to refute their absurd objections. Their only duty 
is to present the Truth before them. Then, if they do not accept it, the pious 
people should not waste their time and energy by entering into useless polemical 
disputes, discussions and argumentations with the disbelievers. Instead, they 
should spend their time and energy in educating and training and reforming those 
who are sincere seekers after the Truth. <br><br>46Here very important practical

the appointed time and then be resurrected so that the Creator may take account 
of all that has been done in it and ultimately build the Next World on the 
results of that reckoning.<br><br>That this world has been created for a purpose 
has also been mentioned at other places in the Qur'an in different ways:<br><br>
(a) "Lord, You have not created all this in vain....." (Al-`Imran, III: 91).<br>
<br>(b) "We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is between 
them for mere fun." (Al-Anbiya', XXI: 16).<br><br>(c) "Do you think that We have 
created you without any purpose and that you will never be brought back to Us?" 
(AI-Mu'minun, XXIV: 115).<br><br>(2) The whole universe has been built on the 
solid foundations of the Truth. Everything in it is based on just, wise and 
right laws and there is no room for injustice and folly and falsehood to take 
root and bear fruit in it. One should not, however, be misled by the partial and 
temporary successes of falsehood. At times Allah may allow the worshipers of 
falsehood opportunity to try their worst for the success of falsehood and 
injustice and wrong ways in order to show that all their efforts shall 
ultimately fail and every worshiper of falsehood will see at the Last Reckoning 
that all the efforts made for the success of this unholy cause had gone utterly 
waste.<br><br>(3) Allah has created the universe in truth and is ruling over it 
by His own personal right. He wields authority here because of His personal 
right as its Creator; one should not, therefore, be misled by seeing others 
holding authority over the affairs of the world. In fact, no one has, nor can 
have, any right to rule here, for no one has any right whatever over anything in 
the universe. <br><br>47It is beyond our comprehension to understand the real 
nature of the blowing of the Trumpet. What we learn from the Qur'an is that on 
the Day of Resurrection when the first Trumpet shall be blown by the Command of 
Allah, everyone and everything shall perish. Then after this (Allah alone knows 
how long after this) the second Trumpet shall be blown; then everyone from the 
beginning of the creation to its end, shall be brought back to life and mustered 
in the Plain of Resurrection. In short, on the first blowing of the Trumpet, the 
present system of the universe shall be destroyed and on its second blowing the 
new system, different in form and with different laws, shall be created. <br>
<br>48It does not mean that today Sovereignty is not His. What it means is this: 
"On that Day the curtain, that is covering the Reality today, will be lifted and 
it will become apparent that all those who seemed to wield authority or were 
supposed to wield it, had absolutely no authority, and that Sovereignty wholly 
belongs to Allah alone, Who is the Creator of the universe<br><br>49Ghaib is all 
that is hidden from the naked eye and cannot be seen and Shahadat is all that is 
visible to it.<br><br>50Ghaib is all that is hidden from the naked eye and 
cannot be seen and Shahadat is all that is visible to it. peace be upon him) and 
deprived them of the satisfaction they had with the creed of shirk. This meant 
to show that the Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and his followers 
were in the position of Prophet Abraham and their opponents were in that of the 
ignorant people who had a dispute with him. The argument was so subtle that it 
took, so to speak, the wind out of their sails and put them in such an awkward 
position that they did not know what to answer. This showed beyond all doubt 
that they were following a way opposed to that of Abraham (Allah's peace be upon 
him) whom they held in great reverence and regarded as their ancestor and 
Prophet. Thus they were placed in the awkward position of his opponents. <br>
<br>51That is, "Just as the phenomena of Nature are daily before your eyes and 
the Signs of God are being shown to you, so were these before Abraham (Allah's 
peace be upon him). But you, like blind men, do not see anything inspite of 
looking at them. The same stars, the samemoon and the same sun rise and set 
before your eyes, but they leave you, as far away from the Reality at the time 
they set as you were at the time they rose. But when Abraham saw with his mind's 
eyes these very phenomena of Nature, he reflected upon them and came to know of 
the Reality. <br><br>52In order to understand the true nature of the dispute 
between the Prophet Abraham and his people mentioned in this passage and others 
in the Qur'an, one should keep in view the religious and social conditions of 
his time. Now that Ur, the brith place of the Prophet Abraham, has been 
unearthed by modern archaeologists, it has helped reveal the real conditions 
prevailing in that land during that age. Sir Leonard Woolley has published the 
results of this research in this regard in his book, "Abraham", London, 1935. A 
resume of the same, (which has been translated into English from the 
Tafhim-ul-Qur 'an, is given below:<br><br>It has been estimated that round about 
the year 2100 B.C. which is now generally regarded by scholars as the period of 
Prophet Abraham, the population of Ur was nearly 250,000; it might even have 
been 500,000. It was a flourishing industrial and business center. On the one 
side, it attracted trade goods from as far off places as Pamir and Nilgiri, and 
on the other, it had trade relations with Anatolia. The State, whose capital it 
was, extended a little less to the north and a little more to the west of modern 
' Iraq. The people were mostly craftsmen and merchants by profession. The 
inscriptions of the age that have been deciphered from the archaeological 
remains show that they had a materialist outlook on life; their main object of 
life was to amass wealth and make merry. They practiced usury and were wholly 
absorbed in business. They regarded one another with suspicion and resorted to 
litigation on minor grounds. Their prayers to their gods generally consisted of 
supplications for long life, prosperity and flourishing business. The population 
was divided into three classes:<br><br>(1) The Amelu : This was the highest 
class which consisted of the priests, state officials and military officers, 
etc.<br><br>(2) The Mushkenu : These were the merchants, craftsmen, and farmers.<br>
<br>(3) The Ardu : The slaves.<br><br>The Amelu class enjoyed special 
distinctions and privileges: they had greater rights both in the criminal and in 
the civil law than those of other people and their life and property were held 
sacred and precious.<br><br>Such was the city and the society in which the 
Prophet Abraham opened his eyes. According to the Talmud, he was a member of the 
Amelu class, and his father was the chief official of the state (Please see also 
Al-Baqarah: E.N. 290).<br><br>The tablets excavated at Ur mention the names of 
about 5,000 gods. Each city had its own god and also a special deity, who was 
regarded as the chief god or the city god and was entitled to greater reverence 
than the others. The city god of Ur was "Nannar" (the moon god) and scholars of 
the later ages have also called this city "Qamrinah" after that god. The other 
big city was "Larsah" which afterwards became the seat of government instead of 
Ur; its chief god was "Shamash" (the sun god). Under these chief gods there were 
many minor gods also, most of whom had been adopted from among the stars and 
planets and a few from among the earthly objects. People thought that their 
prayers for less important things were granted by these minor gods. The symbols 
of all these heavenly and earthly gods and goddesses had been formed in the 
shape of idols and all rites of worship were performed before them.<br><br>The 
idol of "Nannar" had been kept in a grand shrine built on the highest peak at Ur 
and near it the sanctuary of his wife "Ningil" had been built. The shrine of "Nannar" 
was just like a royal palace where every night a different female worshiper 
would go and become his bride. Thus there lived a large number of women in the 
shrine who had been dedicated to the god and their position was no better than 
religious prostitutes. The woman who would sacrifice her virginity in the name 
of the "god" was regarded very respectable. The common belief was that a women 
must surrender herself at least once in her lifetime to another man "in the way 
of god" in order to attain salvation. It is obvious that the people to benefit 
most from this religious prostitution were the male priests themselves.<br><br>"Nannar" 
was not merely a god; he was the biggest landlord of the country, the biggest 
merchant, the biggest craftsman and the chief executive of the country's 
political life, for a very large number of gardens, houses and fields had been 
dedicated to his shrine. Besides the income from these sources, farmers, 
landlords and merchants also brought their offerings of corn, milk, gold, cloth, 
etc., to the shrine. Naturally there was a big staff to look after these 
offerings.<br><br>Many factories were run and business on a large scale was done 
on behalf of the Temple. The highest court of justice had been established in 
the shrine and the priests acted as judges and their judgments were regarded as 
from "God". The royal dynasty also derived its sovereignty from "Nannar", who 
was the real sovereign. The king ruled over the country on his behalf and was, 
therefore, himself raised to the rank of a deity and worshiped like the other 
gods.<br><br>The dynasty which was ruling over Ur in the time of the Prophet 
Abraham had been founded by Ur-Nammu who in 2300 B.C. had established a vast 
empire, which extended to Susa in the east and to Lebanon in the west. It was 
from him that the dynasty received the title of Nammu which became Namrud in 
Arabic. After the emigration of the Prophet Abraham this dynasty and this nation 
were visited by continuous disasters. Their downfall was hastened by the 
destruction of Ur and the capture of Namrud along with the idol of Nannar by the 
people of Elam. Then the Elamis established their rule at Larsah which dominated 
over the land of Ur also. The last blow was dealt by Babylon, which had grown 
powerful under an Arab dynasty and brought both Larsah and Ur under its control. 
As a result of this downfall, the people of Ur lost their faith in Nannar who 
had failed to protect them from humiliation, shame and ruin.<br><br>Nothing can 
be said with certainty about the response the people of this !and made to the 
teachings of the Prophet Abraham after his emigration, but the law promulgated 
in 1910 B.C. by Hamurabi (Amraphel of Gen. xiv), king of Babylon, bears evidence 
that it had been influenced directly or indirectly by the Guidance of 
Prophethood. A pillar inscribed with this complete Code was discovered by a 
French archaeologist in 1902 A.D. and its English version was published in 1903 
A.D. by C. H. W. John under the title, "'The Oldest Code of Law." Most of the 
principles and details of this Law and the Law of the Prophet Moses, are, in 
general, alike.<br><br>If the results of the archaeological research, which has 
been carried out so tar, are correct, one thing that clearly stands out is that 
shirk was not merely a religious belief and basis of polytheistic rituals with 
the people of Abraham but it was indeed the very basis of their economic, 
cultural, political and social system of life. In contrast to this, the Message 
of the Prophet Abraham not only clearly struck at the root of idol-worship, but 
also hit hard upon the sovereignty and worship of the royal dynasty and the 
social, economic and political status of the priests and nobles and the 
collective life of the whole country. Therefore, the acceptance of his 
invitation had far-reaching implications: It called for a complete metamorphosis 
of the prevailing social pattern and demanded its re-construction on the basis 
of Tauhid. That is why, as soon as the Prophet Abraham (Allah's peace be upon 
him) began to deliver the Message, the common people and the nobles, the priest 
class and Nimrod, all stood up together to suppress his voice which gave rise to 
the bitter dispute, mentioned in the Qur'an. <br><br>53In vv. 76 - 78, the way 
of thinking which led the Prophet Abraham (Allah's peace be upon him) to the 
Reality before his appointment as a Messenger of Allah has been stated. It 
teaches that if a person uses his brain and eyes rightly, he can reach the 
Reality, even if he is born and bred, like Prophet Abraham, in surroundings 
surcharged with shirk in which one might have had no chance of learning anything 
about the Oneness of God. The only condition is that one makes the right sort of 
observation of the phenomena of Nature and reflects upon them carefully and 
exercises one's reasoning to reach the truth by a connected, logical train of 
thought. It appears from the preceding verse that the Prophet Abraham, from the 
beginning of his conscious life, was surrounded by the people, who worshiped the 
stars, the moon and the sun. It was, therefore, natural that the starting point 
of his search for the truth should be the question: Can any of these objects 
really be the Lord and Sustainer? That is why his thinking centered round this 
question and when he discovered that all the gods of his people were bound 
tightly by an un-alterable law and were revolving in accordance with it, he came 
to the inevitable conclusion that none of these gods possessed, in the least, 
any quality that might entitle it to be the Lord. The Lord and Sustainer is only 
that One, Who has created them and bound them to His own obedience.<br><br>The 
wording in which the event has been couched, has generally given rise to an 
objection. "When the night outspread over him, he saw a star and said.... I am 
not one of those who set up partners with God. " The question arises in the mind 
of the common reader: Did the night not outspread over Prophet Abraham every day 
of his life ever since he was a child and did he not see the stars, the moon and 
the sun rise and set before this particular occasion? Though he saw them every 
night, it is obvious that he began to deliberate like this only when he had 
attained his maturity. Why has then the event been described in such a way 
("...... When the night outspread over him) as to give rise to the doubt as if 
he had never seen the stars and the moon and the sun ever before this? As such 
an assumption cannot hold good in ordinary circumstances, some people have had 
to invent an extraordinary story to remove this seeming anachronism. They say 
that the Prophet Abraham was born and brought up in a cave, where it was 
arranged that he should not see the stars, the moon and the sun before he 
attained his maturity. The matter, however, is so simple that it does not need 
the invention of a fantastic story to explain it. It can be easily understood by 
a well-known incident in the life of Newton. One day when he saw an apple fall 
down from the tree to the ground, his mind suddenly turned to the problem: Why 
do things fall down to the ground? At last his deliberation led him to formulate 
and prove the law of gravity. Here, too, the question might arise: Had not 
Newton ever seen anything falling to the ground before this incident? it is 
obvious that he must have seen many things fall to the ground many times before 
this. How is it then, that the fall of that particular apple on that particular 
day stirred up that particular mental activity which the daily fall of hundreds 
of things to the ground had not roused before this? The simple answer is that 
the minds are not always excited in the same way by the same kind of 
observations. Many a time, it so happens that one sees a thing over and over 
again but that does not stir up one's mind to any mental activity; then there 
comes a moment when the sight of that very thing diverts the mental activity 
towards a particular problem. Or, if one's mind is engaged in the solution of a 
problem and one suddenly catches sight of a particular thing which had always 
been before one's eyes, it excites the mind to a mental activity that helps 
solve the problem. The same thing happened in the case of the Prophet Abraham. 
Nights came and passed away, the stars, the moon and the sun rose and set for 
years, but on one particular night the observation of one particular star 
excited that mental activity which led him to the central Reality of the Oneness 
of God. It may be that ever since he attained maturity, he might have been 
thinking over the problem of the worship of the stars, the moon and the sun, 
because this was the religion of his people and on this was based the whole 
system of the life of that community. Then one night the observation of the star 
suddenly excited the mental activity that helped him solve the problem. It is 
also possible that the observation of the star was the starting point of that 
mental activity.<br><br>In this connection, there is another possible doubt that 
must also be removed. Was the Prophet Abraham guilty of shirk (even though 
temporarily), when seeing the star and the moon and the sun severally, he said, 
"This is my Lord." A little thinking will convince one that he was not at all 
guilty of shirk for in his search for Reality, a seeker-after-truth has, 
inevitably, to pass through several stages of deliberations about shirk. 
Therefore, what determines his creed is not the temporary deliberation but the 
direction of one's research and the ultimate destination where he stops. These 
intervening stages of deliberation have to be made by every seeker-after-truth 
in his search for Reality. These are made for the sake of research and should 
not be taken as the final decision. The deliberation about any form of shirk is 
in a questioning manner and is not its practice. When a seeker-after-truth stops 
to deliberate about anything and says, "It is so," it is not his final judgment. 
What he means to say is, "Is it so?¦ That is why he proceeds further in his 
research as soon as he gets a negative answer at any of these stages. <br><br>
54The Prophet Abraham asked the mushrikin to remember the fact that his Lord, 
whom they also acknowledged as their Lord, had the knowledge of everything and 
was fully aware of what they were doing. Then he posed the question in order to 
rouse them from their heedlessness towards the Message and use their 
common-sense to consider the reality.<br><br>The Arabic word tadhakkur contains 
this sense. <br><br>55Some commentators are of the opinion that the people of 
Prophet Abraham did not believe in Allah or were ignorant of His existence and 
regarded their gods as the sole masters of the universe. Accordingly, they have 
based their comments of this passage and others about Prophet Abraham on this 
assumption. Obviously, they are wrong because the whole passage clearly shows 
that those people did not deny Allah as the Creator of the earth and heavens, 
but were guilty of associating others with Allah in His Godhead and Sovereignty. 
This is clear from these and other words of the Prophet Abraham:<br><br>''there 
is no reason why I should fear those whom you have made partners with Allah." 
Moreover, the manner, in which he mentions Allah, while addressing his people, 
shows that they also believed in Allah but associated other partners with Him as 
well.<br><br>The word zulm that occurs in v. 82 stands for shirk as translated. 
When some Companions mistook it for sinfulness, the Holy Prophet himself removed 
their misunderstanding saying, "Here it means shirk."<br><br>In . this 
connection, it will also be interesting to note that this most important event 
of the life of Prophet Abraham which has been described in this para and which 
was the starting point of his great Mission, has not been mentioned at all in 
the Bible. The Talmud, however, mentions it, but it differs from the Qur'an in 
two things:<br><br>(1) In it the order is "from the sun to the stars and to God" 
but it is the other way round in the Qur'an.<br><br>(2) It states that, when he 
said about the sun, "This is my Lord," he worshiped it also at the same time and 
did the same with the moon.<br><br>56That is, "Even if the above-mentioned 
people had been guilty of shirk like you, they would never have been exalted to 
such high ranks. This is because shirk is such a heinous sin that it destroys 
good works. It is just possible that any such person might have won fame as a 
great conqueror by ruthless destruction, or might have amassed fabulous wealth 
by foul means and become a notorious wealthy man like Korah or done some 
infamous thing and won name for himself but he could never have won the exalted 
position of being the leader of the pious and the right guided. They won the 
unique distinction of being the source of virtue and guidance for the whole 
world because they scrupulously avoided shirk and steadfastly followed the way 
of God-worship. <br><br>57Here it has been stated that three things had been 
bestowed on the Prophet: (1) The Book, Divine Guidance. (2) The Judgment the 
good sense to understand that Guidance and the capability to apply its 
principles to the affairs of life and the God-given ability to form correct 
opinions about the problems of life. (3) The Prophethood the office of guiding 
the people in accordance with the Divine Guidance. <br><br>58That is,it does not 
matter at all, if these disbelievers and mushrikin have rejected the Guidance of 
Allah. We have raised a Community of the Believers, who appreciate fully the 
worth of this blessing. <br><br>59The context in which the words, "Allah has not 
sent down anything to any man," occur and their refutation clearly show that 
these were the words of the Jews. They uttered these words when the disbelievers 
and the mushrikin of Arabia asked them, "Tell us whether the Word of Allah has 
really been sent down to this man, Muhammad," This question had arisen because 
the Holy Prophet claimed, " I am a Prophet and the Book is being sent down to 
me." The Quraish and the mushrik Arabs turned to the Jews because they possessed 
the Book and believed in the Prophets and could speak with authority. Therefore, 
their answer provided the opponents with a strong weapon against Islam and they 
repeated the answer as an argument to dissuade the people from it. That is why 
their answer has been cited here and refuted.<br><br>Here a possible doubt 
should also be removed: How can a Jew, who believes that the Torah had been sent 
down by God, say, "Allah has not sent down anything to any man?" A little 
thinking will show that a person in his obduracy often utters such things as are 
against his fundamental principles merely to refute his opponent. As the Jews 
were bent upon refuting his claim to Prophethood, they had been so blinded by 
their opposition to the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be peace), that in 
denying his Prophethood they even denied the very office of Prophethood.<br><br>
"Those people formed quite a wrong estimate of Allah ... "means that they 
committed a grave error in evaluating His powers and wisdom. For the person who 
says: "Allah has not sent down the knowledge of the Truth and Guidance for 
life," makes either of the two wrong estimates: (1) He believes that Allah has 
not power to send down Revelation to any man, and this is a wrong estimate of 
the powers of Allah; (2) He thinks that though Allah has given man intelligence 
and authority to exploit the resources of nature, He has made no arrangement for 
his right guidance, but has left him to act indiscriminately in the world, and 
this is a wrong estimate of the wisdom of Allah. <br><br>60This answer is meant 
for the Jews, who had furnished the disbelievers and the mushrikin with the 
arguments that "Allah has not sent down anything to any man..." To refute their 
objection it has particularly been pointed out that the Torah was sent down to 
Moses by Allah, for they themselves believed and could not deny that the Torah 
had been sent down to Moses by Allah . Thus, it was by itself a refutation of 
their assertion that "Allah has not sent down anything to any man.." It also 
proved at least that the Word of God can be sent down to a man, as it had been 
sent down to Moses.<br><br>61After showing in the preceding verse (91) that the 
Word of God can be sent down to a man and that it had actually been sent down to 
Moses, a man, the Qur'an in this verse proceeds to prove that the Word, which 
has been sent down to Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), is actually the Word 
of God. Four things have been put forward as a proof thereof:<br><br>(1). It is 
a blessed Book: it presents the best principles for the welfare and true success 
of man; it teaches the right creeds and inculcates all kinds of virtues and 
exhorts the people of follow a high standard of morality for leading a pure 
life. At the same time, it does not teach in any way whatsoever any vice 
selfishness, narrow-mindedness, cruelty, obscenity and the like, which you have 
interpolated in abundance in your sacred Books.<br><br>(2). It does not present 
anything different form the Guidance contained in the former Scriptures: nay, it 
testifies to the same teaching that had been presented in them.<br><br>(3). This 
Book aims to fulfill the very object for which the former Books had been sent, 
that is, to shake up and rouse those people who had become forgetful of the 
noble object for which they had been created, and to warn them of the evil 
consequences of their wicked ways.<br><br>(4). The Message of this Book has not 
attracted those from among mankind who are the worshipers of this world and 
slaves of their lusts, but only such people as are able to see the higher things 
of life beyond the narrow bounds of their worldly life. Then the most obvious 
characteristic of the revolution that this Book has brought about in their lives 
is that they stand out conspicuously among the people around them for their 
piety and God-worship. Is it possible for any book invented by an impostor, who 
has the audacity to say that it is from Allah, to produce such excellent 
results?<br><br>62That is, it is Allah Who splits open the seed and the 
fruitstone under ground and causes those to grow into plants or trees.<br><br>
63It means that Allah creates living creatures out of lifeless matter and 
discharges lifeless matter out of living creatures. <br><br>64That is, "We have 
made clear the Signs which show conclusively that there is only One Allah and 
that none else has the Divine attributes or powers and none else is entitled to 
any of the Divine rights. However, those who lack knowledge cannot reach the 
Reality by means of these Signs; only those who observe the phenomena of Nature 
in a rational way can attain this precious wealth. " <br><br>65That is, Allah 
has created the whole human race from one single being, Adam, who was the first 
man. <br><br>66That is "Only Men of understanding can find clear Signs of the 
Reality in the creation of human race and in the different functions allotted to 
man and woman for its reproduction at the different stages of human life from 
birth to death. But those, who live like animals and hanker after the 
fulfillment of the lusts of the flesh, can see nothing worthwhile even in these 
Signs." <br><br>67That is, in spite of these clear Signs, some people have set 
up as His partners some hidden beings that are merely the creations of their own 
imagination and whims. They have gone so far in their ignorance as to allot 
different powers and duties to them in the management of the universe and in 
determining the destiny of man. For instance, one has been made the good of rain 
and another of vegetation; one is the goddess of wealth and another of disease, 
etc. Such absurd beliefs have been prevalent among all polytheistic peoples 
about spirits, devils, monks, gods and goddesses. <br><br>68The pagan Arabs 
called the angels "daughters" of God. Likewise some mushrik communities have 
invented even a genealogical tree of gods and goddesses descending from God. <br>
<br>69In the sentence, "I am not a keeper over you," Allah is speaking in the 
first person on His Prophet's behalf. Just as the second person in the Qur'an 
denotes different people at different places, so the first person also denotes 
different beings at different places. As is well known, in some places, the 
second person is the Holy Prophet or the Believers or the people of the Book, 
and at other places it is the disbelievers or the mushrikin or the Quraish or 
the Arabs or the human beings in general, though the Qur'an is meant to be the 
guidance for all mankind, Likewise at some places, the first person is Allah 
Himself and at others it is the angel, the bearer of the Revelation, or a group 
of angels, or the Prophets or the Believers, though, in every case, the Words 
are of Allah. However, one can determine the real "person" with the help of the 
context.<br><br>The meaning of the sentence. "I am not a keeper over you," is : 
"My only duty is to present the guidance before you. Then it is for you to open 
your eyes to see it or to keep your eyes shut like a blind man. It is not my 
duty to force open the eyes of those, who deliberately keep them shut and to 
make them see what they do riot see."<br><br>70The different ways of expression, 
in which the Revelation has been couched, are a test for the people, because 
they help to discriminate the counterfeit from the genuine. The same thing has 
already been stated in Al-Baqarah, II: 26, in connection with the mention of 
insignificant things like flies, gnats, etc. in the parables of the Qur'an. Just 
as the mention of these insignificant things helps the seekers in finding the 
Truth, in the same way the different ways of expression help those, who have 
knowledge and make use of it, to think deeply about their aims and objects and 
learn lessons for their own good. On the contrary, those people, who are 
bigoted, pay no attention to the subject-matter, but begin to think on other 
lines. For instance, they begin to conjecture how this illiterate man can 
compose such excellent discourses. Thus, instead of judging the Qur'an from its 
excellent themes to be the Revelation from Allah, they turn to every other 
possible source and say, "You have learned this from such and such a one." Then 
in the "light" of this so-called successful "Research" into the source of the 
Qur'an, they conclude that it could not be the Book of God. <br><br>71It means: 
"You have been appointed to invite the people to the Message and not to keep 
watch over them like a police inspector. Therefore your only duty is to present 
the Message to the people and try, your best to convince them of the Truth. 
After that, if someone does not accept the Truth, leave him alone. You have not 
been appointed to force the people to accept it so as to leave no worshiper of 
falsehood within the range of your Prophethood. Therefore you should not worry 
yourself and try to make them open their eyes which they have deliberately shut. 
If Allah had, in His Wisdom, willed that there should remain no worshiper of 
falsehood, He would not have entrusted you with this task. He could have made 
each and every human being a follower of the Truth, merely by a single word of 
His Command. But this is not the object of the creation of man. The real object 
is that man be given the freedom of choice between the Truth and falsehood: And 
then by presenting the light of the Truth before him, he be tested which one of 
the two he chooses. Now the right course for you is to follow the Right Way 
yourself and to invite others to follow it. Then you should make those, who 
accept it, your friends and not to forsake them in any case, even though they 
are very insignificant in the eyes of the worldly people. On the other hand, you 
should leave those alone who do not accept it and let them go to the evil end to 
which they themselves want to go and persist in doing so."<br><br>72The 
followers of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) have been advised not to lose 
their balance in zeal for preaching but to remain within proper limits when 
engaged in discussions and polemics with the non-Muslims and to refrain from 
offending against their creeds and from vilifying their leaders and objects of 
worship, for this will repel and alienate them all the more from the Truth. <br>
<br>73Allah has ascribed their deeds to Himself, for everything that takes place 
in accordance with the Laws of Nature does, in fact, happens by the command of 
Allah. (Please refer to E.N. 17 above). As Allah is the Author of all the Laws 
of Nature, everything happens by His Command: therefore, Allah says, "We have 
made the deeds of every people seem fair to them." The human beings would, 
however, express the same thing, saying, "This has happened according to the Law 
of Nature. "<br><br>74Here "Sign" stands for such a tangible miracle seeing 
which they should have no alternative left but to acknowledge that Muhammad 
(Allah's peace be upon him) was a true Prophet appointed by Allah. <br><br>
75That is, "I have no power to bring about and present Signs, for these are 
entirely in the power of Allah and He may or may not show them." <br><br>76These 
words are addressed to those Muslims, who ardently wished (and sometimes even 
expressed their wish) that their misguided brethren should be shown such a Sign 
as might bring them to the Right Way. To this Allah has answered, 'You should 
realize that they would not believe even if a Sign were shown to them, for this 
demand is merely a pretext for their disbelief.<br><br>77That is, there has been 
no change in their mentality since the first time they heard and rejected the 
Message of the Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). They are still 
following the same crooked and perverted way of looking at the Message and, 
therefore, are unable to see and understand it rightly. <br><br>78That is, "As 
they are not going to reject falsehood and accept the Truth by making a free and 
deliberate choice, the only alternative left for making them follow it is that 
Allah should force it upon them: He should change their nature so as to deprive 
them of the freedom of thought and action like other species which have not been 
made responsible for what they do. But this is against the wisdom of the object 
for which Allah has created man. You should not, therefore, expect that Allah 
would make them believers by His supernatural intervention." <br><br>79Allah is 
consoling His Messenger, so as to say, "You should not worry at all about the 
united and active antagonism of the satans from among men and jinn against your 
Mission. This is not a new thing only happening to you for it has always been 
happening like this to the Messengers. Whenever a Messenger came to show the 
Right Way, all the satanic powers girded up their loins to make his Mission a 
failure.<br><br>"Charming things" are all those devices, schemes, suspicions, 
objections, etc., that are employed by the satans to excite and incite the 
common people against the Message and the Messenger who invites them to the 
Truth. Then all these things have been called the means of deceit and delusion 
as a whole, for all the weapons that the opponent use against the Truth are, in 
fact, deceptions not only for others but also for the deceivers themselves, 
though they appear to be very useful and effective weapons. <br><br>80We have 
already explained in E.N. 73 above the fact of this matter, but the fine 
distinction between Allah's "will" (mashiyat) and His approval (rada) should 
also be kept in mind; otherwise there might arise very serious 
misunderstandings. It must be clearly understood that nothing whatsoever can 
happen without the "will" and permission of Allah, for no incident can happen, 
unless Allah makes room for it in His vast scheme and provides means for its 
happening. But it does not necessarily mean that Allah also. approves of and is 
pleased with that incident. For instance, no thief can commit theft, no murderer 
can kill, no tyrant can be tyrannical, no breaker of peace can cause disorder, 
no unbeliever can disbelieve and no mushrik can commit shirk, etc., etc., 
without the "Will" of Allah. Likewise, no believer can have Faith and no pious 
person can be pious unless it be the "Will" of Allah; yet He is not pleased with 
the first kind of bad deeds, whereas He is pleased with and approves of and 
likes the second kind of good deeds. It is true that the "Will" of Allah is 
working for an ultimate great good, but that can only come about by means of a 
conflict between light and darkness, good and bad, peace and disorder. 
Therefore, He allows, for the sake of His great good designs, the necessary 
freedom both to the powers of obedience and to those of disobedience, of piety 
and sin, of Prophethood and the forces of evil, so that both might be allowed to 
perform the deeds of their own choice and to those of His creatures (men and 
jinn) who have been delegated with a limited authority and the consequent 
responsibility. Everyone is free to make a choice of good deeds or of bad deeds 
for himself in this world. Both the good and the bad people are allowed to have 
the necessary means, as far as it suits and fits into the Divide Design, but 
only those who make a choice of good works merit His pleasure and approval, for 
Allah likes that His servants should make the right use of their freedom of 
choice and adopt good instead of evil.<br><br>In this connection, it will be 
worthwhile to understand why Allah mentions over and over again that it is by 
His "Will" that the enemies of Truth have been allowed to carry on their 
nefarious activities. This is to impress upon the Holy Prophet, and through him 
on his followers, that the nature of their work is different from that of the 
angels, who carry out the Commands of Allah without meeting with any resistance. 
Their Mission, requires that in their conflict with the wicked and rebellious 
people, they should exert their utmost to make the Way of Allah dominant over 
their ways. That is why it is the "Will" of Allah to allow such people as have 
deliberately chosen the way of rebellion against Allah to exert their worst in 
pursuance of their choice. Likewise, He allows the` Believers also full 
opportunity to exert their utmost in the service and obedience of Allah that 
they have deliberately chosen. Though He is pleased with and gives His help and 
succor to the Believers and guides them to the Right Way because they do the 
deeds He likes them to do, yet they should not expect that Allah will force, by 
His supernatural intervention, the unbelievers to believe, if they do not want 
to believe by their free choice; or that He will remove by force from their way 
those satans amongst men and jinn who have deliberately chosen to use all the 
powers of their hearts and minds and bodies against the Truth in order to block 
its way. They should note it well that, if they sincerely intend to work for the 
cause of truth, virtue and righteousness, they will have to prove this by 
putting up hard struggle and exerting their utmost in their conflict with the 
worshipers of falsehood. If Allah had willed to demolish falsehood and make the 
Truth dominate by miracles, there was no need to entrust this work to the 
Believers for in that case He Himself could have arranged the things so as to 
leave no satan in the world and no room for shirk and disbelief to make their 
appearance.<br><br>81The `speaker' in this sentence is the Holy Prophet and the 
addressees are his followers, who desired that a Sign should be shown for the 
conversion of the disbelievers. They have been told that no Sign will be shown, 
for Allah had made all the realities plain in the Qur'an. As regards their 
conflict with falsehood, He has decreed that the followers of the Truth will 
have to exert for its domination in the natural way without expecting any 
supernatural intervention from Him. The Holy Prophet has, therefore, been asked 
to declare, "Should I, then, seek some authority higher than Allah to revise His 
decree and to send down such a miracle as should force them to believe?" (Please 
refer also to E.N. 76). <br><br>82That is, "These principles, that have been 
laid down for the domination of the Truth, are not new ones which might have 
been invented today to explain away the difficulties and obstacles of the Way. 
All those people, who possess the knowledge of the Divine Books and are 
acquainted with the Mission of the Prophets, will bear testimony that whatever 
is being stated in the Qur'an is the very Truth, which is eternal and has never 
changed. " <br><br>83The right thing for a seeker-after-truth is not to consider 
what way the majority of the people are following because that is based on 
guess-work instead of knowledge. Their beliefs, theories, philosophies, 
principles of life and laws are the result of guess-work and are, therefore, 
sure to mislead. In contrast to that, the way of life with which Allah is 
pleased, can only be the Way which Allah Himself has taught. Therefore, the 
seeker-after-truth should adopt that way and steadfastly follow it, even though 
he is left alone on it. <br><br>84Among the many wrong things which the people 
have adopted as religious laws without any Divine sanction are also the 
restrictions they have imposed on the articles of food. That is why some people 
have made certain things lawful whereas they are unlawful in the sight of God, 
and certain other things unlawful, though Allah has declared them to be lawful. 
In this connection, the most absurd thing on which some of the former people 
insisted and on which some of the modern people also insist, is that if Allah's 
name is pronounced at the slaughter of an animal, it is unlawful and if it is 
slaughtered without mentioning Allah's name over it, it is quite lawful. In this 
verse Allah has refuted such ideas and commanded the Muslims to discard all such 
whims and superstitions which have been invented by the unbelievers and the 
mushrikin and break all such restrictions which the people have imposed on 
themselves against the Guidance of Allah, if they sincerely believe in it. They 
should, therefore, make unlawful only that which Allah has made unlawful and 
vice versa. <br><br>85Please see vv. 114-116, An-Nahl. Incidentally, this 
reference also shows that Surah An-Nahl was revealed before Al-Anam. <br><br>
86This is with reference to the different kinds of doubts and objections with 
which the Jewish scholars used to poison the minds of ignorant Arabs against 
Islam. According to a tradition of Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas, one of the 
objections taught by the Jews against the Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be 
upon him) was: "How is it that the one killed by Allah (by natural death) should 
be unlawful, while the other which is killed by us (by mentioning the name of 
Allah) should be lawful?" This is an instance of the crooked attitude of those 
so called people of the Book. They would invent and pose questions like this 
before the common people so as to poison their minds with doubts and to arm them 
with weapons to fight with the Truth. <br><br>87It is also shirk to acknowledge 
the Godhead of Allah and at the same time follow the decrees and ways of those 
who have turned away from Allah. The acknowledgment of the Oneness of Allah 
demands that one should obey Allah in all aspects of one's life. So much so that 
if a person believes that someone else also should be obeyed along with Allah, 
he would be guilty of committing shirk in his creed. And if a person obeys such 
people as arrogate to themselves the authority of making things lawful and 
unlawful, in utter disregard of the Guidance of Allah, he would be guilty of 
practical shirk.<br><br>88Here ".... who was first dead" means, "..... who was 
first in a state of ignorance and lacked understanding;" likewise, ".... then 
(he) was given life" means "then he was given knowledge and understanding and 
was restored to that mental state which can recognize the Truth." And the fact 
is that one who cannot distinguish between right and wrong and does not know the 
Right Way, might be regarded as alive from the physical point of view, but he 
does not enjoy that life which makes him a real human being. He is no doubt a 
living animal, but he is not a living man. A living man is only he who can 
distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad, righteous and unrighteous.<br>
<br>89That is, "How can you expect that a man, who has got real understanding of 
life and recognizes clearly, by the light of Knowledge, the Straight Way from 
among the countless crooked ways, would live a life like those who lack 
understanding and blunder blindly into the darkness of ignorance and folly?"<br>
<br>90It is the Law of Allah that He makes their deeds seem fair to those who 
refuse to be guided by the Light which is offered to them and who prefer to 
tread the crooked paths, even though they are invited to the Right Way. Then 
they begin to love darkness and like groping their way through it like the blind 
and to be knocked about throughout their lives. Accordingly, every vice appears 
to them worth enjoying and every piece of folly a gem of wisdom. After the 
failure of such an experiment that produces mischief, they get ready for another 
in the hope that the first failure was due to some "accidental" mistake that 
will be avoided in future experiments. <br><br>91What they meant was: "We are 
not going to believe in the claim of the Messengers that an angel came to them 
with a Message from God, unless the angel comes directly to us to deliver the 
Message of Allah." <br><br>92"He makes his breast wide open to Islam" means: 
"Allah makes him fully convinced of the truth of Islam by removing from his mind 
and heart every kind of doubt, suspicion, hesitation and indecision about 
Islam." <br><br>93"Abode of peace": Heaven, the place of perfect peace and 
happiness, where the dwellers will be immune from every kind of calamity and 
misery. <br><br>94Here by the "jinn" are meant the "satans of jinn." <br><br>
95That is, "Every one of us made an unfair use of the other and cheated him for 
selfish ends."<br><br>96As Allah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, both punishment 
and forgiveness will be based on wisdom and knowledge and, therefore, will be 
reasonable and just. He will forgive only that wrongdoer, whom He knows not to 
be personally responsible for his crime and liable to punishment.<br><br>97That 
is, just as they were accomplices in their sins and crimes in the world, so they 
shall also share the punishment in the Hereafter.<br><br>98That is, "We confess 
that one Messenger after the other came from You and informed us of the Truth 
but it was our own fault that we did not believe in what they said.''<br><br>
99They themselves would confess that they were not ignorant of the Truth: it did 
reach them but they deliberately rejected it. <br><br>100It means that Allah 
does not desire to allow the guilty ones the opportunity to protest and say, 
"You did not inform us of the Truth, nor did You send anyone to show us the 
Right Way. But now when, in our ignorance we have adopted the wrong way, You are 
going to punish us for it." In order to refute this argument, Allah sent His 
Messengers and Books to fore-warn mankind and jinn, prior to the execution of 
His Judgments. If, in spite of this, the people choose wrong ways and are 
punished for this, they themselves are to blamed and not Allah. <br><br>101"Your 
Lord is All-Sufficient": "He does not stand in need of any kind of help from 
you, nor does He need anyone to look after His interests. Therefore, you can do 
him no harm by your disobedience, nor can you do Him any good by your obedience. 
Even if all of you rebel against Him, you cannot detract an iota from His 
Kingdom; nor can you add an iota to it, if all of you decide to obey and worship 
Him. He needs neither your obedience nor your offering. As a matter of fact, he 
is showering His countless blessings on you without desiring anything in return 
from you."<br><br>In the context in which the sentence, "He is 
All-Compassionate", occurs, it implies two things. First, "It is only out of 
compassion for you that Allah is showing you the Right Way and not for His own 
interest. It will not serve any interest of His if you follow the Right Way and 
keep away from the wrong ways: nor will it do Him any harm if you swerve from 
it. As a matter of fact, you will be serving your own interest and avoiding harm 
to yourselves by following it. Therefore, it is His kindness that He teaches you 
the right conduct to enable you to attain higher ranks and restrains you from 
wrong behavior that will throw you to the lowest depths of degeneration." 
Second, "Your Lord. is not ruthless: He does not enjoy punishing you for 
trifling offenses and errors. As a matter of fact; He is very kind and 
sympathetic to all His creatures and rules over them with great compassion. That 
is why He' forgives and forbears your shortcomings over and over again and shows 
compassion and leniency to you even though you become guilty of disobedience, 
sins and crimes. You impudently discard His Commandments, knowing well that He 
is your Providence; yet He forgives and forbears and gives you respite after 
respite, so that you may understand the Reality and mend your ways. Had He been 
ruthless He could have destroyed you instantly and raised up another people to 
replace you, or destroyed the whole human race and created another species. "<br>
<br>102That is, "Resurrection," when all human beings, from the first to the 
last, shall be brought back to life and presented before their Lord for final 
judgment. <br><br>103That is, "If you do not take the warning from Me and do not 
give up your wrong ways, then you may go on following the ways of your choice, 
and let me follow my way. Ultimately, both you and I will see the consequences."<br>
<br>104The preceding discourse (v. 135) ended with these words: "If these people 
are not willing to accept your Admonition and insist on their ignorance, tell 
them to act in their own way and that you will act according to your own way. 
The Day of Judgment will surely come one day when they will know the 
consequences of their conduct. Anyhow, this is certain that the workers of 
iniquity will not be successful there." Now from here (vv. 136-146), instances 
of their ignorance are being cited to tell them what their "iniquity" was in 
which they persisted and from which they could not expect any success. <br><br>
105They assigned a portion of the agricultural produce to Allah as a mark of 
their gratitude because they believed that all land belonged to Allah Who caused 
the crops to grow; likewise they set apart for Allah a portion of the animals 
which were of great use to them because He was their Creator as well. But at the 
same time, they also assigned a portion as offerings to the patron gods of their 
family or clan, for they believed that Allah showed His kindness to them, 
because their gods, goddesses, angels, jinn, stars and the souls of their dead 
ancestors interceded with Him in their behalf. They also expected that in this 
way they would continue their kindness to them. That is why Allah is first of 
all taking them to task for the iniquity they were committing, so as to say, "It 
is sheer ingratitude that you are making offerings to others of the things that 
I have created and given you with My own mercy and grace. How is it, then, that 
you are making others partners in the offerings of your gratitude to Me? Do you 
think that I give these things to you because of the intercession of others?" 
Then, by implication, Allah has rebuked them for dividing the shares between Him 
and the partners set up by them with Him in accordance with their own 
presumptions .This is because they have become their own law-makers and assign 
to Allah and to others whatever share they deem proper , when in fact ,Allah is 
the real giver of everything. Therefore, the portion to be assigned to Him in 
gratitude should be determined by His Law, which should also decide the shares 
of the other rightful claimants to it. It is thus clear that even that share, 
which they arbitrarily set apart for Allah and distribute in the poor and 
indigent, does not merit any worth and there is no reason why is should be 
accepted by Allah.<br><br>106This implies a fine sarcasm. They have been rebuked 
for the evil practices to which they resorted in order to reduce even that 
portion which they themselves ear-marked for Allah, so as to increase the 
portion set apart for their gods. This showed that they were far more interested 
in their self-made gods than God. For instance, they would not mind if any fruit 
or grain out of the share assigned to Allah happened to go to the other side, 
but would return it, if anything happened to go to the share of Allah from the 
share of their gods. In case of drought, if they were forced to make use of the 
consecrated grain, they would use the share ear-marked for Allah but would not 
touch the share of their gods for fear lest any misfortune should befall them on 
account of its desecration. If there happened to be a deficiency in the share of 
their gods, they would make it up from that of Allah's share, but in the reverse 
case, they would not take even the smallest thing from the share of their gods 
to make up for the deficiency in Allah's share. Obviously they would invent very 
plausible excuses for this. For instance, they would say, "God is rich and can 
afford to forgo any decrease in His share, but the case of gods is different 
because they are not rich like Allah: therefore they inflict punishment even at 
the slightest decrease in their share."<br><br>The root cause of these 
superstitious practices was the different uses to which the two consecrated 
shares were put. Allah's share was given to the beggars, the indigent, the 
wayfarers, the orphans, etc., but the share consecrated to the gods went to the 
priests directly or indirectly when it was offered to the gods in their temples. 
That is why their selfish religious leaders had been, for centuries, impressing 
on their ignorant followers that there was no harm, if any decrease occurred in 
the share of Allah, but on no account should there be any decrease in the share 
of their gods, "the beloved of God." On the contrary, it was rather commendable 
that their share should continue to swell.<br><br>107Here the word shuraka 
(associates) has been used in a different sense from the one employed in verse 
136. There the ¦associates" meant the deities whose intercession they regarded 
as a means of attaining to the blessings and made them partners with Allah in 
offerings. But, on the contrary, in this verse "associates" implies the men and 
devils, who had made the killing of their own children lawful and praiseworthy 
for them. In the preceding verse they were guilty of shirk because they 
associated others with Allah in His worship and devotion. Here they were guilty 
of shirk because they accepted others besides Allah as law-givers and made them 
Judges for deciding the lawful and the unlawful. According to Islam, a person 
who accepts any law made by another than Allah as authoritative and follows it 
and considers himself subject to the limits prescribed by it, is guilty of 
making that being partner with Allah. Both these are acts of .shirk. one is 
guilty of shirk whether or not one gives the title of lord or god to those to 
whom one consecrates offerings or accepts and obeys the laws made by them.<br>
<br>As regards the killing of their children, the Arabs committed this sin with 
three objects in view and the Qur'an has condemned all the three:<br><br>(1) 
They killed their daughters in order to avoid the disgrace of having a 
son-in-law, or lest they should fall into the hands of the enemy during the 
clannish wars, or they should become a cause of disgrace for them in any other 
way.<br><br>(2) They killed their children for economic reasons. They feared 
lest the burden of their nourishment should become unbearable for them.<br><br>
(3) They sacrificed their children at the altar of their gods to please them.
<br><br>108The word "ruin" here is very meaningful. On the one hand, it implies 
moral ruin, for the man who becomes so hard-hearted and cruel as starts killing 
his own children, loses not only the tender qualities of humanity but also those 
of animality; on the other, it also implies destruction of the human race and 
one's own nation, for the inevitable result of the killing of children is 
reduction of the population of one's own nation and consequently of the world as 
a whole. Obviously, the nation which prevents the birth of its future supporters 
and builders of its civilization and heirs of its heritage, or kills them as 
soon as they are born, most surely falls into the abyss of destruction. Above 
all, this inhuman cruelly to innocent children destroys all the chances of 
success in the life-after-death because such a one who kills his own humanity, 
nay, even his own animal instinct of love for offspring, and shows such enmity 
with the human race and with one's own nation, most surely incurs the most 
painful torture from Allah. <br><br>109Their religious leaders, their chiefs and 
the elders of the clans and others who exercised any influence on them and who 
claimed to be the followers of the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael, had been adding 
different creeds, rites and practices to the pure religion taught by the 
Prophets and causing confusion in the minds of the people about it. Yet the 
common Arabs of the pre-Islamic period believed that they were following the 
religion of their Prophets, which was the chosen religion of Allah, though it 
had been utterly polluted. This was because no record of the real religion of 
the Prophets had been preserved in their traditions or history or in any other 
book and none could sift it from the additions and changes that had been made in 
it afterwards.<br><br>110That is, "O Messenger, you need not worry about them, 
if, in spite, of your admonitions, they insist on following the false ways they 
have invented. All this has come to pass because it is the will of God that they 
should be allowed to follow the way of their choice; otherwise they would not 
have been able to do what they are doing."<br><br>111Here another self-made 
religious regulation of the mushrik Arabs has been refuted. They used to make 
vows to reserve certain cattle or the products of certain fields for some 
particular temple or saint or deity and had made set rules for their use. 
Accordingly, the right of the use of different kinds of offerings was reserved 
for a particular kind of people. Allah has declared these to be acts of shirk 
and warned them against these self-made laws, as if to say, "We will punish you 
for making vows concerning offerings to others from provisions provided by Us, 
because We have neither commanded you to make such vows nor prescribed 
restrictions for their use. All these things have been invented by the 
rebellious and arrogant people who shall be dealt with severely." <br><br>112We 
learn from traditions that in certain forms of vows and offerings, it was not 
considered right to pronounce the name of Allah over cattle. It was also 
forbidden to ride on them during the Hajj journey, because one has to pronounce: 
Labbaik, Allahumma labbaik: "I am present, O my Allah, I am present," during it. 
Likewise, they insisted that Allah's name should not be mentioned while milking 
them or riding them or slaughtering them or eating them. <br><br>113That is, 
"These regulations were not prescribed by Allah, but they were following these 
with the conviction that they had been prescribed by Allah. though they had no 
authority from Allah for this thing. The only authority, they had, was that it 
had been the practice of their forefathers."<br><br>114According to another 
article of the self-made law of the Arabs about the cattle, consecrated by vows 
and offerings, the males alone were allowed to eat of the flesh of the young 
ones born from their wombs and the females were forbidden to eat of it. However, 
if the young one was born dead or it died immediately after its birth, both the 
males and the females could partake of it. <br><br>115That is, "Although those 
people, who invented these rituals and customs, were your forefathers, your 
religious leaders and your chiefs, yet the fact is that they were wrong and had 
gone astray. Also it is a fact that those ways were wrong and they cannot become 
right and sacred simply because these were invented by your forefathers and your 
religious leaders, who permitted the inhuman slaughter of one's own children, 
who made unlawful, without rhyme or reason, the pure provisions given by Allah 
and who introduced innovations in religion and ascribed them to Allah. They 
cannot be regarded as rightly guided by any stretch of imagination even though 
they be your forefathers and leaders; they were certainly misguided and shall 
bear the consequences of their evil ways."<br><br>116The original Arabic words 
Jannat-im-ma iushat-in literally mean gardens of creepers, trellised, and has 
been translated into vineyards; wa ghaira ma 'rushat-in literally mean gardens 
of plants that are un-trellised and has been translated into gardens of up-right 
trees. <br><br>117The original Arabic word farsh refers to animals (like sheep 
etc.,) in the sense that they are of small size and almost touch the ground 
while they are moving about, or in the sense that they are laid on the ground at 
the time of slaughter, or in the sense that beds are made of their skins and 
hair. <br><br>118From the context in which this verse (142) occurs, it is 
obvious that Allah wills to impress three things: (1) "The gardens, the fields 
and the animals you possess, have all been bestowed by Allah, and none else has 
any share in this favor and, therefore, none else is entitled to any gratitude 
for this." (2) "As none else has any share in this favor, these should be used 
in accordance with the Law of Allah, and none else has any right to prescribe 
limits for their use; therefore the one who observes the rituals prescribed by 
any one other than Allah, transgresses the limits prescribed by Allah and 
follows the ways of Satan." (3) "All these things have been created by Allah for 
food and other uses for mankind and none has any right to make these unlawful 
without "knowledge." Therefore Allah does not approve of the restrictions that 
have been imposed on these things, as a result of superstitions and 
presumptions.<br><br>119That is, "Your answer should be based on knowledge and 
not on mere presumptions, superstitions or the traditions of your forefathers."
<br><br>120The question whether some animals of the same family are lawful and 
others unlawful, has been posed with such a detail so that the absurdity of 
their superstitions may become obvious even to them. It is absurd on the face of 
it that the male of the same family should be lawful and the female unlawful, or 
conversely, the female should be lawful and the male unlawful, or the animal 
should be lawful, but the young one of the same be unlawful: This is such a 
nonsensical thing that no right thinking person, nay, no man in his senses, can 
imagine that Allah could ever impose such unreasonable restrictions. It should 
be noted that the method applied by the Qur'an to show the absurdity of the 
superstitious practices of the Arabs can also be applied with equal force to 
expose the folly of the superstitious practices of the other nations of the 
world, which have imposed unreasonable restrictions on food and adopted inhuman 
indiscriminations against other human beings. <br><br>121This subject has 
already been dealt with in v. 173, AI-Baqarah, and in v. 3, Al-Ma`idah, and will 
be further discussed in v. 115, An-Nahl below.<br><br>There appears to be a 
little difference in the wording of this verse and that of v. 173, Al-Baqarah. 
In the latter verse it is simply `blood' that is forbidden, but in this verse it 
is the `blood' that has been shed, when an animal is wounded or slaughtered. The 
addition of the word masfuh (that has been shed) merely explains the nature of 
the `blood' and does not make any difference in the "Commandment" itself. 
Likewise in v. 3 of Al-Ma'idah, some other things besides these four have also 
been mentioned-the animals that have been strangled or beaten to death, or 
killed by a fall, or mangled by a beast of prey. This, too, does not make any 
difference in the "Commandment" in the two verses, because this is an 
explanation which shows that the animals which are killed in that way should 
also be considered as "carrion."<br><br>Now let us consider the various opinions 
of the Jurists. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas and Hadrat `A'ishah were of the 
opinion that, out of the animal food, only these four were unlawful and all 
others were lawful. But there are several Traditions to the effect that the Holy 
Prophet prohibited other animals besides these four or held them in detestation, 
e.g., domestic donkeys and fanged beasts of prey and birds with claws. Therefore 
most jurists do not consider the prohibition to be confined to these four things 
only, but extend it to others; then there is also a difference of opinion among 
the jurists about the prohibition or otherwise of certain animals. For instance, 
Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik and Imam Shafi`i declare the domestic donkey to be 
unlawful, but there are others who assert that the domestic donkey, is not 
unlawful and say that it was prohibited by the Holy Prophet on one occasion only 
for some special reason. The Hanafi s consider the carnivorous beasts and birds 
of prey and the animals that live on dead flesh to be absolutely unlawful, but 
according to Imam Malik and Auza`i, the birds of prey are lawful and Laith 
considers the cat to be lawful. According to Imam Shafi i. only those 
carnivorous beasts are unlawful that (like the lion, wolf, tiger) attack man. 
According to ' Ikrimah, the crow and the badger are both lawful. Then according 
to the Hanafi s, all crawling creatures are unlawful, whereas Ibn AbiLaila, Imam 
Malik and Auza' i consider the snake to be lawful.<br><br>A careful and critical 
study of the above makes it quite clear that, in reality, only these four things 
mentioned in the Qur'an are unlawful and that there are certain other animal 
foods that are detestable in various degrees. Therefore those things, which 
according to authentic Traditions were held in detestation by the Holy Prophet, 
are almost unlawful, but those things about which there is a difference of 
opinion among the jurists, their detestation is doubtful. As far as personal 
detestation of certain things by some people is concerned, the Islamic Law does 
not compel anyone to eat what one dislikes. The same applies to the detestation 
of certain things by some groups or nations. Conversely, the Law does not allow 
any person or community or nation to force others to consider as unlawful 
anything that they detest, or to .prohibit its use to those who consider them 
unlawful.<br><br>122That certain things were made unlawful for them as 
punishment for their rebellion has been mentioned in the Qur'an at three places:<br>
<br>(1) "All the articles of food, which are lawful in the Muhammadan Law, were 
also lawful for the children of Israel, except those which Israel had forbidden 
for himself before the Torah was sent down. Say to them, Bring the Torah and 
read out any passage from it (in support of your objection), if you are in the 
right. " (Al- `Imran, 111):<br><br>(2) "It is because of the criminal attitude 
of those who became Jews...... that We had made unlawful many pure things which 
were formerly lawful for them". (An-Visa' IV:160)<br><br>(3) Here in this Surah, 
in verse 146.<br><br>From the above three verses, we conclude that the 
difference between the Muhammadan and the Jewish Laws in regard to the legality 
or otherwise of animal food is based on two things. First, centuries before the 
revelation of the Torah, the Prophet Jacob (Israel) had given up the use of 
several things, and after him, his offspring also did the same. This went on for 
such a long time that the jurists of the Jewish Law began to believe that those 
things were unlawful in their religion. Accordingly, they inserted in the Torah 
the prohibition of those things, the three of which were the camel, the hare and 
the Coney. That is why the Torah, as contained in the existing Bible prohibits 
their eating. (Levit. 11: 4-6 and Deut. 14:7). But, the open challenge of the 
Qur'an to them to bring the Torah in proof thereof shows that the commandments 
referred to above did not exist in the Torah at that time and were inserted 
afterwards; otherwise the Jews would have at once accepted the challenge of the 
Qur'an and presented the commandments thereof.<br><br>The second difference 
between the two laws was caused by the rebellious attitude of the Jews against 
the Divine Law. They became their own law-makers and made many things unlawful 
by their hair-splitting and Allah let them remain involved in that 
misunderstanding as a punishment. These things comprise two categories : (1) 
Animals with claws such as the ostrich, the cuckoo, the swan, etc., and (2) the 
fat of the cow and the goat, etc. Afterwards both kinds of "prohibitions" were 
incorporated in the existing Torah. (Levit. 11 : 16-18, Deut. 14 : 14-17, Levit. 
3 : 17, 7 : 22-23). But it is obvious from An - Nisa, IV : 160 that at first 
these things were not unlawful i the Torah, but were made so after the Prophet 
Jesus Christ. History also bears evidence that the existing Jewish Law was 
formulated by Rabbi Judas at the end of the second century of the Christian Era.<br>
<br>Now let us consider the objection that might arise regarding the above 
explanation. If these things were made unlawful in the manner explained above, 
why has, then, Allah used the word harramna ("We prohibited") here in verse 130 
and in verse 160 of An-Nisa In considering the objection, we should keep in mind 
the two ways in which things are made unlawful by Allah. (1) He prohibits a 
thing through a Messenger and a Book, and this is the blessing from Him. (2) He 
sets false religious law-givers and counterfeit law-makers over His rebellious 
servants and they declare pure things as unlawful. As such a prohibition' is the 
curse of God and a punishment from Him, it has been attributed to Him. <br><br>
123That is, "Your Lord has limitless Mercy and if even now you repent of your 
disobedience and adopt the right way of obedience, He will forgive you. But if 
you persist in your criminal and rebellious attitude, you should note it well 
that none will be, able to ward off His wrath and punishment from you. "<br><br>
124That is "The mushrikin will put forward the same old excuses to justify their 
crime and wrong conduct which have always been put forward by the criminals and 
wrong-doers of every age: they will say, `It is the will of Allah that we should 
commit shirk and make some lawful things unlawful; for, if Allah had not so 
willed, it would not have been possible for us to commit such acts. As we are 
doing these things in accordance with the will of Allah, we are doing the right 
thing. And if what we are doing is not right, Allah is to blame for it and not 
we. We are bound by the will of Allah to do what we are doing because anything 
other than this is beyond our power." <br><br>125In order to understand the 
significance of this decisive answer to their lame excuse, let us analyze it: 
(1) It warns: "The `will of God' has always been made an excuse by the criminals 
of all ages to justify their wicked acts and erroneous conduct. This misled them 
so much that they rejected the Truth and consequently met with ruin that 
overtakes those who fight against the Truth." (2) "The excuse which you are 
putting forward is not based on knowledge but on conjecture and guess-work. The 
whole of your argument is based on hearsay about the will of Allah. You do not 
understand the meaning of `the will of Allah' in regard to man. Therefore you 
wrongly believe that if a thief commits theft he is not to be regarded as a 
thief, because he had done this under `the will of Allah. Its real meaning is 
that Allah will open for a man whatever way he would choose for himself -- the 
way of gratitude or ingratitude, guidance or deviation, obedience or 
disobedience. Then Allah will let the man do anything, good or bad, he chooses, 
and will provide for its fulfillment the means that fit in His vast universal 
designs. Therefore if you and your forefathers were allowed to commit shirk and 
declare lawful things unlawful under the will of Allah, they had to bear its 
consequences, for it does not mean that Allah approved of these things. Likewise 
you shall be responsible and accountable for your wrong choice and for your evil 
intentions and wicked deeds."<br><br>The last sentence, "..... had Allah so 
willed, He would have shown guidance to all of you," settles the issue 
decisively. It implies: "Your argument, `had Allah willed, we would not have 
committed shirk,' is incomplete. The complete thing will be this: `Had Allah 
willed, He would have shown guidance to all of us." In other words, "You 
yourselves do not intend to choose the right way, but you desire that Allah 
should make you inherently righteous like angels. You should, however, note it 
well, that Allah could have done so if He had so willed. But this is not His 
will. Therefore He will let you go astray on the wrong way that you yourselves 
have chosen to follow."<br><br>126That is, "If they understand the grave 
responsibility of bearing witness and realize that one should bear witness only 
to that thing of which one has knowledge, they will never testify that all their 
self-imposed restrictions on food, that are current among them and according to 
which such and such a one should not eat such and such a thing, have been 
prescribed by Allah. But if these people do not realize the responsibility of 
bearing witness and impudently give false evidence in the name of Allah, you 
should not associate yourself with their falsehood. As a matter of fact, the 
real object of challenging them to bear witness is to sort out the righteous 
people, if any, from among them, and not that you should accept their false 
testimony. It is expected that in response to the challenge to bear witness, 
those, who have any righteousness left in them, will consider very seriously 
whether the rituals they were following were really prescribed by Allah and if 
they find no proof that these were sent down by Allah, they will give them up."<br>
<br>127That is, "The limits set by your Lord are not those which you have 
imposed on yourselves, but they are the following which Allah has set for the 
regulation of human life and which have always been the fundamental basis of all 
Divine Laws." (Please compare these precepts with those contained in Exodus 
chapter 20). <br><br>128One is guilty of shirk if: (a) one sets up another 
besides Allah as god, or (b) one attributes to another any of those attributes 
that naturally and exclusively belong to Allah, or (c) one sets up a partner 
with Allah in His powers, or (d) in His rights.<br><br>According to (a), all 
those creeds which set up partners with Allah in the essence of His Godhead 
shall be shirk, e.g., the creed of Trinity of the Christians, the creed of 
musrhik Arabs to believe in the angels to be daughters of God and to attribute 
"Godhead" to their gods and goddesses and the members of the royal families.<br>
<br>According to (b), all those, who believe that someone other than Allah also 
possesses one or some or all of the attributes which exclusively belong to 
Allah, shall be guilty of shirk. For instance, it will be shirk if one believes 
that someone knows all about everything including the "unseen" or hears 
everything or is completely free from each and every defect and weakness, and is 
infallible like Allah.<br><br>According to (c), one shall be guilty of shirk, if 
one believes that someone else besides Allah is able to wield any one or all of 
those powers that exclusively belong to Him. For instance, one shall be 
committing shirk, if one believes that someone else besides Allah can, in a 
supernatural way, benefit or harm or fulfill heeds or help or protect or defend, 
or hear prayers, or make or mar destinies, or set the limits of lawful or 
unlawful, proper or improper, or prescribe laws (shar a) for human life. These 
shall be shirk, for all these things are the exclusive characteristics of 
Godhead.<br><br>It shall be shirk under (d) if one surrenders to another any or 
all of those rights to which Allah alone is entitled. For instance, Allah alone 
has the right that man should stand with bound hands, bow and prostrate before 
Him, or he should make vows and give offerings in His name alone or make 
sacrifices as a mark of gratitude in acknowledgment of His greatness; He alone 
has the right that He should be invoked to ward off troubles etc. Likewise, 
Allah alone is entitled to all forms of worship, devotion and glory and He alone 
has the right to be loved more than anyone or anything else and all other 
affections should be sacrificed for His love. He alone should be feared so that 
one would not dare displease or disobey Him openly and secretly. He alone has 
the right to be obeyed unconditionally and unreservedly; and His Guidance alone 
should be made the sole standard of judging right from wrong and none else 
should be obeyed except in accordance with the obedience to Allah. If ever one 
of these rights is surrendered to someone other than Allah, it will be setting 
that one as a partner with Him, whether that one is given the title of god or 
not.<br><br>129"Kind treatment" includes respect and honor, obedience and desire 
to please and serve parents etc. , This right of the parents has been stated in 
the Qur'an at several places immediately after the rights of Allah. This is a 
clear proof that this right of the parents is only next to the right of Allah 
and has priority over all human rights. <br><br>130The Arabic word fawahish 
applies to all kinds of impure acts, whose obscenity is absolutely obvious. The 
Qur'an declares adultery, sodomy, nudism, calumny, marriage with father's wife 
as "indecencies." Besides these, theft, drinking and beggary have also been 
included in the list of indecencies in the Traditions. Likewise, all other 
obscene acts are also indecencies and the Divine Commandment demands that such 
acts should neither be committed openly nor secretly. <br><br>131This is the 
declaration of the sanctity of human life by Allah Who has made it inviolable as 
a basic principle. As regards its destruction "by right", the Qur'an allows this 
in three cases and the Holy Prophet added two more to these. The Qur'an makes it 
lawful to take the life of the one:<br><br>(1) who is proved guilty of the 
intentional murder of another person.<br><br>(2) who opposes Islam and obstructs 
its establishment so as to leave no other alternative than to fight with him,<br>
<br>(3) who spreads disorder within the Islamic territory or exerts to overthrow 
the established Islamic government.<br><br>Besides these, the Holy Prophet has 
made it lawful to .take the life of the one:<br><br>(4) who, in spite of being 
married, is proved guilty of adultery,<br><br>(5) who becomes an apostate and 
deserts the Islamic Community.<br><br>These five are the only cases in which it 
becomes lawful to take human life and there is no other case in which it becomes 
lawful to take human life and there is no other case besides these in which 
human life may be taken, be it that of a Muslim, or of a dhimmi, or of an 
unbeliever. <br><br>132"The best way" will be the one which is based on 
selflessness, good intentions and the welfare of the concerned orphan, and which 
is not objectionable in the sight of God or man. <br><br>133"You shall use full 
measure and a just balance,'' is a fundamental principle of the Divine Law: 
Allah has added, "We charge one.....one can bear," to assure people that whoever 
tries his very best to be just and right in measuring, weighing and carrying out 
other trade transactions, will be absolved from his responsibility and will not 
be taken to account, if in spite of his best efforts, there happens to be an 
unintentional error. <br><br>134"Covenant with Allah" is: (i) The solemn 
agreement which man makes with Allah, (i!) the solemn pledge which he makes with 
another man in the name of Allah, and (iii) the natural compact that comes into 
force as soon as one is born in the human society on Allah's earth.<br><br>The 
first two kinds of covenants are intentional and optional, but the third one is 
a moral and natural obligation. Though man has no option in the choice of the 
third compact, yet it is as binding as the first two and should be honored as 
'much. This is because Allah has given him life with extraordinary physical and 
mental faculties and furnished the earth for his habitation and provided 
nourishment, and limitless resources etc., for him. Naturally all this entails 
some rights of Allah on him. Likewise it entails some, rights of the mother who 
gives birth to and nourishes him and of the father who brings him up and of the 
society that affords him many kinds of facilities and opportunities. All these 
rights become, by their very nature, obligatory on him in varying degrees. It is 
true that this "Covenant" of man with God and society has not been written in 
any statute book, nevertheless it has been ingrained by Nature in each and every 
particle of his body, which itself owes its very existence to this Covenant. A 
reference to this has been made in Al-Baqarah, ti: 27: "....who break Allah's 
Covenant after ratifying it: who cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined 
and who produce chaos on the earth." It has again been mentioned in Al-A'raf, 
VII: 172 to this effect: At the time of the creation of Adam, Allah brought 
forth all his would-be descendants up to the Last Day, from the loins of 
mankind, and trade them stand witnesses to the Covenant that He is their Lord.
<br><br>135"..... you should follow this way because this is the Right Way." 
This "Natural Covenant" demands that man should follow the Way shown by Allah, 
because any deviation from it into the paths of rebellion or independence or in 
the worship of another than Allah will be the first violation against that 
Covenant, and will mislead one into other violations one after the other. 
Besides, no man can fulfill the obligations of this most delicate, vast and 
intricate Covenant unless one accepts Divine Guidance and follows it in every 
aspect of life. "...... you should not follow other ways" because they will turn 
you away from His Right Way which is the only Way which leads to His nearness, 
pleasure and approval. Moreover, when the people deviate from His High Way, each 
man has to make his own choice out of the hundreds of other ways. Thus the 
people are scattered in all directions and there is bewilderment, confusion and 
disorder among all mankind and this becomes a hindrance in the way of its real 
progress and development (Please see also E.N. 35, Al-Ma'idah).<br><br>136"..... 
to believe in meeting with one's Lord" means that one should believe that one 
shall have to render an account of one's deeds to one's Lord; therefore one 
should live a life of responsibility. Here it may imply that the Torah was sent 
(1) to produce a sense of responsibility among the Israelites themselves and (2) 
to induce the other people to make a study of its high moral system of life, and 
to observe the noble effects of its guidance and blessing on those who adopted 
its teachings so that they may be convinced that a life of responsibility based 
on the belief in the life of the Hereafter is far better than an irresponsible 
life based on its rejection and this observation may convince them to believe in 
the Hereafter.<br><br>137That is, to the Jews and the Christians.<br><br>138Here 
"Ayat" are Allah's Revelations presented in the Holy Qur'an as well as His 
Messenger's noble character and the pure lives of the Believers which clearly 
distinguished them from the unbelievers, and also those wonderful phenomena of 
Nature which the Qur'an was putting forward as proofs of the truth of its 
Message. <br><br>139"Manifest Signs" are the signs of the Day of Resurrection or 
some imminent scourge or some other Sign that tray unveil the Reality in such a 
way as to leave no doubt about it and after which no more chance for test and 
trial might be left.<br><br>140That is, if after seeing these "Manifest Signs" a 
disbeliever repents of his disbelief and professes faith, such a conversion 
shall be meaningless; likewise the one who professes to believe but adopts the 
way of disobedience, shall be deemed to have no faith at all, because Faith and 
Obedience can have any value only up to the time that the reality remains hidden 
behind the curtain, and the prospect of a long life is ahead and the world with 
all its allurements is deluding one into believing that there is no Allah and no 
Hereafter; therefore, one should "Eat, drink and be merry."<br><br>141Though the 
address is directed to the Holy Prophet, yet all the followers of the True 
Religion are, through him, included in it. It means that the righteous people 
should not follow the ways of those who became sects by causing divisions in the 
True Religion, which has always been the same and is the same today. Its basic 
principles are that Allah alone is the Deity and Lord of the whole Universe. 
that none should be set up as His equal or partner in His attributes, powers or 
rights, that there shall be the next world, in which all human beings shall have 
to render the account of what they do in this world, and that they should mold 
their lives in accordance with those broad fundamental principles that have been 
taught by Allah through His Messengers and Books. This is the True Religion that 
had been given to mankind from the very first day of its creation. As regards 
the different religions and sects that came into existence afterwards, they were 
the result of the changes that were made in the True Religion by different 
people at different times. Some of them introduced new things into it, others 
made changes in it to suit their lusts; still others mixed things in it because 
of their exaggerated reverence. Then they tampered with its creed by mixing with 
it their whims, their speculations and their philosophies. They changed it also 
by adding to its commandments their innovations and their self-made laws and by 
corrupting its regulations by hair-splitting and exaggerating the differences in 
its details and by rendering important things unimportant and vice versa. They 
went to two extremes: they adored some Prophets too much and opposed and 
rejected others. In this way numerous new religions and sects came into 
existence and divided humanity into fighting groups. Therefore it is essential 
for a follower of the True Religion to have nothing to do with any of these 
sects and to keep his own path clear of them.<br><br>142"Abraham's Way": This is 
another distinctive characteristic of "the ever-True Faith." This has been given 
preference to "Moses' Way" or "Christ's Way" because the followers of Moses and 
Christ had applied the misnomers of ''Judaism" and "Christianity" to that "Way." 
Moreover, the term "Abraham's Way" has been used because both the Jews and the 
Christians acknowledged Abraham as a true Prophet. They also knew it well that 
he died long before the births of Judaism and Christianity. The Arab mushrikin 
also could not deny that his "Way" was the Right Way, for they believed that he 
was a righteous man and in spite of their ignorance, they had to acknowledge 
that the founder of the Ka'bah was a pious worshiper of Allah and not an 
idolater. <br><br>143The Arabic word nusuk ("rites of worship") may mean animal 
sacrifice as well as all other forms of prayer and worship.<br><br>144That is, 
"When, in fact, Allah is the Lord of everything in the universe, how can any 
other be my Lord? When I see that the whole of the universe submits to His Law 
and I, too, being a part of the universe, have to submit to Him in my physical 
life, how can then it be rational that I should seek another Lord for the 
guidance of that part of my life for the conduct of which I have been given 
common sense and option?"<br><br>145It means that everyone is responsible and 
accountable for his own deeds and this responsibility can, on no account, be 
shifted from one to the other. <br><br>146In this verse three realities have 
been stated;<br><br>(1) That each and every thing in the universe belongs to 
Allah and all human beings are His vicegerents on the earth in the sense that He 
has entrusted many of His things to them and delegated powers to exploit them.<br>
<br>(2) That Allah has ascribed different ranks to His vicegerents in regard to 
the trusts. He has entrusted some with a large number of His things, while 
others with a small number and endowed some with a greater capacity for work 
than others. Likewise there is a difference in the powers He has delegated to 
them: nay, he has even given powers to some human beings over other human 
beings.<br><br>(3) That this worldly life is merely a test and all the things 
and powers that have been given as trusts are the means of the test. An accurate 
record is being kept of how each man is making use of his trust and how far he 
is exploiting these things in accordance with the terms of the trust and how he 
is using or abusing his abilities, capabilities, etc. in this regard. The result 
of his test will determine man's rank in the Next World.</p>
