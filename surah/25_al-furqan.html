Ah! the Evil One is but a traitor to man!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Then the Messenger will say: "O my Lord! Truly my people took this Qur´an for just foolish nonsense."</li><li class="collection-item"> Thus have We made for every prophet an enemy among the sinners: but enough is thy Lord to guide and to help.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who reject Faith say: "Why is not the Qur´an revealed to him all at once? Thus (is it revealed), that We may strengthen thy heart thereby, and We have rehearsed it to thee in slow, well-arranged stages, gradually.</li><li class="collection-item"> And no question do they bring to thee but We reveal to thee the truth and the best explanation (thereof).</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who will be gathered to Hell (prone) on their faces,- they will be in an evil plight, and, as to Path, most astray.</li><li class="collection-item"> (Before this,) We sent Moses The Book, and appointed his brother Aaron with him as minister;</li><li class="collection-item"> And We command: "Go ye both, to the people who have rejected our Signs:" And those (people) We destroyed with utter destruction.</li><li class="collection-item"> And the people of Noah,- when they rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and We made them as a Sign for mankind; and We have prepared for (all) wrong-doers a grievous Penalty;-</li><li class="collection-item"> As also ´Ad and Thamud, and the Companions of the Rass, and many a generation between them.</li><li class="collection-item"> To each one We set forth Parables and examples; and each one We broke to utter annihilation (for their sins).</li><li class="collection-item"> And the (Unbelievers) must indeed have passed by the town on which was rained a shower of evil: did they not then see it (with their own eyes)? But they fear not the Resurrection.</li><li class="collection-item"> When they see thee, they treat thee no otherwise than in mockery: "Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a messenger?"</li><li class="collection-item"> "He indeed would well-nigh have misled us from our gods, had it not been that we were constant to them!" - Soon will they know, when they see the Penalty, who it is that is most misled in Path!</li><li class="collection-item"> Seest thou such a one as taketh for his god his own passion (or impulse)? Couldst thou be a disposer of affairs for him?</li><li class="collection-item"> Or thinkest thou that most of them listen or understand? They are only like cattle;- nay, they are worse astray in Path.</li><li class="collection-item"> Hast thou not turned thy vision to thy Lord?- How He doth prolong the shadow! If He willed, He could make it stationary! then do We make the sun its guide;</li><li class="collection-item"> Then We draw it in towards Ourselves,- a contraction by easy stages.</li><li class="collection-item"> And He it is Who makes the Night as a Robe for you, and Sleep as Repose, and makes the Day (as it were) a Resurrection.</li><li class="collection-item"> And He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy, and We send down pure water from the sky,-</li><li class="collection-item"> That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of things We have created,- cattle and men in great numbers.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We have distributed the (water) amongst them, in order that they may celebrate (our) praises, but most men are averse (to aught) but (rank) ingratitude.</li><li class="collection-item"> Had it been Our Will, We could have sent a warner to every centre of population.</li><li class="collection-item"> Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness, with the (Qur´an).</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water: One palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter; yet has He made a barrier between them, a partition that is forbidden to be passed.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who has created man from water: then has He established relationships of lineage and marriage: for thy Lord has power (over all things).</li><li class="collection-item"> Yet do they worship, besides Allah, things that can neither profit them nor harm them: and the Misbeliever is a helper (of Evil), against his own Lord!</li><li class="collection-item"> But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and admonition.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "No reward do I ask of you for it but this: that each one who will may take a (straight) Path to his Lord."</li><li class="collection-item"> And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not; and celebrate his praise; and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants;-</li><li class="collection-item"> He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between, in six days, and is firmly established on the Throne (of Authority): Allah Most Gracious: ask thou, then, about Him of any acquainted (with such things).</li><li class="collection-item"> When it is said to them, "Prostrate to (Allah) Most Gracious!", they say, "And what is (Allah) Most Gracious? Shall we prostrate to that which thou commandest us?" And it increases their flight (from the Truth).</li><li class="collection-item"> Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving light;</li><li class="collection-item"> And it is He Who made the Night and the Day to follow each other: for such as have the will to celebrate His praises or to show their gratitude.</li><li class="collection-item"> And the servants of (Allah) Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace!";</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who spend the night in adoration of their Lord prostrate and standing;</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who say, "Our Lord! avert from us the Wrath of Hell, for its Wrath is indeed an affliction grievous,-</li><li class="collection-item"> "Evil indeed is it as an abode, and as a place to rest in";</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who, when they spend, are not extravagant and not niggardly, but hold a just (balance) between those (extremes);</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, nor slay such life as Allah has made sacred except for just cause, nor commit fornication; - and any that does this (not only) meets punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> (But) the Penalty on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him, and he will dwell therein in ignominy,-</li><li class="collection-item"> Unless he repents, believes, and works righteous deeds, for Allah will change the evil of such persons into good, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful,</li><li class="collection-item"> And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah with an (acceptable) conversion;-</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who witness no falsehood, and, if they pass by futility, they pass by it with honourable (avoidance);</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who, when they are admonished with the Signs of their Lord, droop not down at them as if they were deaf or blind;</li><li class="collection-item"> And those who pray, "Our Lord! Grant unto us wives and offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes, and give us (the grace) to lead the righteous."</li><li class="collection-item"> Those are the ones who will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven, because of their patient constancy: therein shall they be met with salutations and peace,</li><li class="collection-item"> Dwelling therein;- how beautiful an abode and place of rest!</li><li class="collection-item"> Say (to the Rejecters): "My Lord is not uneasy because of you if ye call not on Him: But ye have indeed rejected (Him), and soon will come the inevitable (punishment)!"</li>

<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>The Surah takes its name "Al-Furqan" from the first verse. Though 
it is symbolic like the names of many other Surahs, it has a close relation to 
its subject matter.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>It appears from its style 
and subject matter that, like Surah Al- Mu'minun, it was also revealed during 
the third stage of Prophethood at Makkah. Ibn Jarir and Imam Razi have cited a 
tradition of Dahhak bin Muzahim that this Surah was revealed eight years before 
Surah An Nisa. This also confirms our opinion as to its period of revelation. (Ibn 
Jarir, Vol. XIX, pp. 28-30, and Tafsir Kabir, Vol. VI,p. 358).<br><br><strong>Subject 
Matter and Topics</strong><br><br>The Surah deals with the doubts and objections that 
were being raised against the Qur'an, the Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's peace 
and blessings be upon him) and his teachings by the disbelievers of Makkah. 
Appropriate answers to each and every objection have been given and the people 
have been warned of the consequences of rejecting the Truth. At the end of the 
Surah, a clear picture of the moral superiority of the Believers has been 
depicted as in the beginning of Surah Al-Mu'minun, as if to say, 'Here is the 
criterion for distinguishing the genuine from the counterfeit. This is the noble 
character of those people who have believed in and followed the teachings of the 
Holy Prophet and this is the kind of people that he is trying to train. You may 
yourselves compare and contrast this type of people with those Arabs, who have 
not as yet accepted the Message, and who are upholding "ignorance" and exerting 
their utmost to defeat the Truth. Now you may judge for yourselves as to which 
you would like to choose." Though this question was not posed in so many words, 
it was placed before every one in Arabia in a tangible shape. It may be noted 
that during the next few years, the practical answer given to this question by 
the whole nation, with the exception of a small minority, was that they chose 
Islam.</p>
<hr>
<p>1The Arabic word tabaraka is very comprehensive, and cannot be understood 
fully and completely by "highly blessed", not even by a sentence. However, its 
meanings may be grasped by keeping in view the remaining portion<br><br>of vv. 
1-2. Here it has been used to convey the following meanings:<br><br>(1) He is 
the most Beneficent: that is why He has bestowed the great blessing of Al-Furqan 
by degrees on His servant so that he may admonish all mankind.<br><br>(2)He is 
the most Exalted and Great: for the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth 
belongs to Him.<br><br>(3) He is the most Holy, Pure and Perfect: He is free 
from every tinge of shirk and has neither a partner in His Godhead, nor needs a 
son to succeed Him; for He is Ever-Lasting.<br><br>(4) He is the Highest and the 
Most Supreme in rank: the Kingdom and the Dominion wholly and solely belong to 
Him, and there is none who has any share in His Authority and Powers.<br><br>(5) 
He is the sole Creator of the universe and has created each and everything in it 
and predetermined its destiny. For further details, see E.N. 14 of AI Mu'minun 
and E.N. 19 of AI-Furqan. <br><br>2Al-Furqan: The Criterion. The Qur'an has been 
called Al-Furqan because it is the Criterion for judging right and wrong virtue 
and vice, truth and falsehood. <br><br>3The word nazzala implies revelation of 
the Qur'an piecemeal by degrees. The wisdom of this introductory remark will be 
explained in the study of verse 32, where the objection of the disbelievers of 
Makkah -as to why the Qur'an has not been sent down all at once-has been dealt 
with<br><br>4“..... warner to all mankind": To warn all mankind of the evil 
consequences of their heedlessness and deviation. The warner may be AI-Furgan or 
the Holy Prophet to whom it was revealed. In fact, both were the warners because 
they were both sent for one and the same purpose. The message of the Qur'an and 
Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) were not meant 
for any particular country but for the whole world; and not for their own time, 
but for all times to come. This has been stated at several places in the Qur'an; 
for instance: "O Muhammad, say, O mankind, I am a Messenger to all of you from 
Allah ....." (Al-A`raf: 158); "..... and this Qur'an has been revealed to me so 
that I should thereby warn you all and whom it may reach." (Al An'am: 19); "We 
have sent you only as a bearer of good news and as a warner to all mankind." 
(Saba: 28); and "We have sent you as a mercy to all mankind." (Al Anbiya': 107) 
The Holy Prophet himself has stated this clearly in the Hadith; for instance, he 
said: "I have been sent to all men-the red and the black." "Before me a Prophet 
was sent only to his own people, but 1 have been sent to all mankind." (Bukhari, 
Muslim). "I have been sent to all mankind, and I am the Last of the Prophets." 
(Muslim).<br><br>5Another translation may be: "To Him belongs the Sovereignty of 
the heavens and the earth." That is, He alone has an exclusive right to it, and 
no one else has any right to it nor any share in it.<br><br>6That is, "He has 
neither any relation of direct parenthood to anyone, nor has He taken anyone as 
a son. Therefore, none else in the universe is entitled to worship. He is Unique 
and there can be no partner in His Godhead. Thus all those who associate with 
Him angels or jinns or saints as His offspring, are ignorant. Likewise, those 
who believe that some one, is His "son", are also ignorant. They have no true 
conception of the Greatness of Allah and consider Him to be weak and needy like 
human beings, who require some one to become their inheritor. It is sheer 
ignorance and folly." For further details, see E.N.'s 66 to G8 of Surah Yunus .<br>
<br>7The Arabic word mulk means Sovereignty, Supreme Authority, and Kingship. 
Thus the sentence will mean: "Allah is the Absolute Ruler of the whole universe 
and there is none other who may have any right to authority; therefore He alone 
is God." For whenever a man takes anything else as his lord, he does so under 
the presumption that his deity has the power to do good or bring harm and make 
or mar his fortune; nobody will like to worship a powerless deity. Now when it 
is recognized that none but Allah has the real power and authority in the 
universe, nobody will bow before anyone other than Him in worship, nor will sing 
anybody else's hymns, nor commit the folly of bowing in worship before any thing 
else except his real God, or recognize any other as his ruler, because "To Allah 
belongs the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and to Him alone." <br><br>
8There may be other translations of this also: "He has ordained it in due 
proportion"; or "He has appointed an exact measure for everything." But no 
translation can convey its real meaning, which is: "Allah has not only created 
everything in the universe but also determined its shape, size, potentialities, 
characteristics, term of existence, the limitations and extent of its 
development and all other things concerning it. Then, He has created the means 
and provisions to enable it to function properly in its own separate sphere."<br>
<br>This is one of the most comprehensive verses of the Qur'an with regard to 
the Doctrine of Tauhid. According to Traditions, the Holy Prophet himself taught 
this verse to every child of his family as soon as it was able to speak and 
utter a few words. Thus, this verse is the best means of impressing the Doctrine 
of Tauhid on our minds, and every Muslim should use it for educating his 
children as soon as they develop understanding. <br><br>9The words are 
comprehensive and cover all the false gods whom the mushriks worship whether 
they are angels, jinns, Prophets, saints, the sun, the moon, the stars, trees, 
rivers, animals etc., which have been created by Allah, or those which have been 
created by man, as the idols of stone, wood, etc. <br><br>10That is, "Allah has 
sent down Al-Furqan on His servant so that he may invite the people to the 
Truth, which they have forsaken due to heedlessness and waywardness, and warn 
them of the evil consequences of their folly. The Furqan is being revealed 
piecemeal so that he may distinguish right from wrong and the genuine from the 
counterfeit."<br><br>11Another translation may be: "a great injustice."<br><br>
12This is the same objection which the modern orientalists have raised against 
the Qur'an, but strange as it may seem, no contemporary of the Holy Prophet ever 
raised such an objection against him. Nobody, for instance, ever said that 
Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) as a boy had met Buhairah, the monk, and 
had attained religious knowledge from him, nor did anybody claim that he had 
obtained all that information from the Christian monks and Jewish rabbis during 
the trade journeys in his youth. In fact, they knew that he had never traveled 
alone but in the caravans and if they said such a thing, it would be refuted by 
hundreds of their own people from the city.<br><br>Then, one could ask, if he 
had gained all that knowledge from Buhairah when he was about 12, and during 
trade journeys when he was 25, why did he keep it secret from the people till he 
became 40? whereas he did not leave his country even for a single day, but lived 
for years among his own people in the same city. That is why the people of 
Makkah dared not bring such an impudent and baseless charge against him. Their 
objections related to the time when he claimed to be a Prophet of Allah and not 
to the time preceding that claim. Their argument was like this: "This man is 
illiterate and cannot obtain any knowledge through books. He has lived among us 
for forty years, but we have never heard from him anything that might have shown 
that he had any acquaintance with what he is preaching; therefore he must have 
had the help of other people who copied these things from the writings of the 
ancients for him: he learns these things from them and recites them as Divine 
Revelations: this is a fraud." So much so that according to some traditions, 
they named some of his "helpers", who were the people of the Book, were 
illiterate and lived in Makkah. They were: (1) Addas, a freed slave of Huvaitib 
bin `Abdul `Uzza(2) Yasar, a freed slave of 'Ala bin Al Hadrami, and (3) Jabr, a 
freed slave of `Amir bin Rabbi`ah .<br><br>Apparently this is a weighty 
argument. For there can be no greater proof of the "fraud" of Prophethood than 
to specify its source. But it looks strange that no argument has been put 
forward to refute this charge except a mere denial, as if to say, "Your charge 
is an impudent lie: you are cruel and unjust to bring such a false charge 
against Our Messenger; for the Qur'an is the Word of Allah Who knows all the 
secrets in the heavens and the earth. " Had their charge been based on facts, it 
would not have been rejected with contempt, for in that case the disbelievers 
would have demanded a detailed and clear answer. But they realized the strength 
of the arguments and did not make such a demand. Moreover, the fact that the 
"weighty" argument failed to produce any doubt in the minds of the new Muslims, 
was a clear proof that it was a lie.<br><br>The enigma is clearly explained if 
we keep in view the prevalent circumstances<br><br>(1) The disbelievers of 
Makkah did not take any decisive steps to prove their charge, although they 
could, had there been any truth in their charge. For instance, they could have 
made raids on the houses of the alleged helpers and on the house of the Holy 
Prophet himself and taken hold of the whole "material" which was being used in 
this "fraud", and made it public to expose his Prophethood. And this was not 
difficult for them because they never hesitated to resort to anything to defeat 
him, including persecution, as they were not bound by any moral code.<br><br>(2) 
The alleged helpers were not strangers. As they lived in Makkah, everyone knew 
it well how learned they were. The disbelievers themselves knew that they could 
never have helped to produce a unique and sublime Book like the Qur'an which had 
the highest literary excellence and merit. That is why none of them challenged 
the answer to the charge. That is why even those people, who did not know them, 
considered this frivolous. Then if the alleged helpers were such geniuses, why 
did they not claim to be prophets themselves?<br><br>(3) Then, all the alleged 
helpers were freed slaves who were attached"to their former masters even after 
their freedom according to the customs of Arabia; therefore they could not have 
become willing accomplices of the Holy Prophet in this "fraud" of false 
prophethood because their former masters could have coerced them to expose it. 
The only reason for them to help the Holy Prophet in his claim could have been 
some greed or interest which, under the circumstances, could not even be 
imagined. Thus, apparently there was no reason why they should have offended 
those whose protection and patronage they needed and enjoyed, and become 
accomplices in the "fraud".<br><br>(4) Above all, all these alleged helpers 
embraced Islam. Could it be possible that those very persons, who had helped the 
Holy Prophet to make his "fraud" successful, could have possibly become his 
devoted followers? Moreover, if, for the sake of argument, it be admitted that 
they helped him, why was not any of them raised to a prominent rank as a reward 
of his help? Why were not 'Addas and Yasar and Jabr exalted to the same status 
as were Abu Bakr and 'Umar and Abu 'Ubaidah? Another odd flung is that if the 
"fraud" of prophethood was being carried on with the help of the alleged 
helpers, how could it remain hidden from Zaid bin Harithah, 'AIi bin Abi Talib, 
Abu Bakr and other people, who were the Holy Prophet's closest and most devoted 
Companions? Thus the charge was not only frivolous and false, but it was also 
below the dignity of the Qur'an to give any answer to it. The charge has been 
cited merely to prove that those people had been so blinded by their opposition 
to the Truth that they could say anything.<br><br>13"... He is very Forgiving 
and Merciful" is very meaningful here. It means that Allah is giving full 
respite to the enemies of the Truth, for He is "Forgiving and Merciful"; 
otherwise He would have sent down a scourge to annihilate them because of the 
false charges they were bringing against the Messenger. It also contains an 
admonition, as if to say, "O unjust people! if even now you give up your enmity 
and obduracy and accept the Truth, We shall forgive your previous misdeeds. "<br>
<br>14That is, "He cannot be a Messenger of Allah because he is a human being 
like us. Had Allah willed to send a Messenger, He would have sent an angel, and 
f at all a human being was to be sent, he should have been a king or a 
millionaire, who would have resided in a castle and been guarded by attendants. 
A Messenger could not be an ordinary person who has to move about in the market 
places like the common people, for it is obvious that such a human Messenger 
cannot attract the attention of the people. In other words, they thought that a 
Messenger was not meant to guide the people to the right path but to coerce them 
to obedience by show of worldly power and grandeur. For further details, see 
E.N. 26 of Al-Mu'minun.<br><br>15That is, "If a human being was to be sent as a 
Messenger, an angel should have been appointed to accompany him to proclaim: `If 
you do not believe in him, 1 will scourge you." But what son of a Messenger is 
he, who has to suffer from abuse and persecution?"<br><br>16That is, "If nothing 
else, Allah should at least have made extraordinary arrangements for his 
livelihood. But this man has no treasure and no gardens; yet he claims to be a 
Messenger of the Lord of the universe."<br><br>17The disbelievers of Makkah made 
the false propaganda against the Holy Prophet that he had been bewitched by some 
jinn or by the sorcery of an enemy or by the curse of some god or goddess for 
his insolence. But it is strange that they also admitted that he was a clever 
man who could make use of extracts from the ancient writings for the sake of his 
"prophethood", could practice sorcery and was also a poet.<br><br>18As these 
objections were frivolous and meaningless like others, the Qur'an has ignored 
them, saying, "Your objections are irrelevant, unreasonable and void of sense. 
You bring no sound argument to prove your doctrine of shirk, or to refute the 
Doctrine of Tauhid put forward by him, whereas the Messenger gives such proofs 
of the Doctrine of Tauhid that you cannot refute them except by saying, 'He is 
bewitched'. The same is true of the doctrine of the life-after-death and of the 
moral system of the Qur'an, which has produced men of high character. You cannot 
deny these things; you reject them, saying, "He is a human being like us, etc.”<br>
<br>19Here again the word tabaraka has been used and in the context it means: 
"Allah has full control over everything and has unlimited powers: if he wills to 
favor somebody, He can do so as and when He wills without let or hindrance. "<br>
<br>20The word As-Sa'at, meaning the Time or the Hour, has been used in the 
Qur'an as a term for the promised Hour of Resurrection, when all human beings of 
all ages will be raised from the dead and gathered together before Allah 
Almighty to account for their beliefs and deeds, right or wrong, and rewarded or 
punished accordingly.<br><br>21That is, "The objections they are raising are not 
due to the reason that they doubt the authenticity of the Qur'an on some 
rational ground, or that they do not believe in you for the reason that you eat 
food and walk about in the streets like the common people, or that they did not 
accept your Message of Truth only because you were not escorted by an angel, or 
were not given a treasure. But the real reason why they are putting forward all 
sorts of absurd arguments to reject your Message, is that they do not believe in 
the life-after-death, and this denial has made them free from all moral 
obligations. For when one denies the life-after death, there remains no need for 
him to consider and decide what is true or false, or what is right or wrong, 
etc. Their argument is like this: 'There is going to be no life after this one 
on the earth when we will be called to account for our deeds before God. Death 
will be the end of everything, and it will therefore make no difference whether 
one was a worshiper of God or a disbeliever or a mushrik or an atheist When the 
ultimate end is to become one with the dust, there is no need of judging what is 
right and what is wrong except by the criterion of "success" and "failure" in 
this life'. Those who deny the Hereafter also see that worldly success or 
failure does not entirely depend upon one's faith or conduct; nay, they very 
often see that the righteous and the wicked persons meet with the same end 
irrespective of their faith for which there is no ordained punishment or reward 
in this life; one righteous person may be living a life of hardship while 
another enjoying all the good things of life; one wicked person may be suffering 
for his misdeeds while the other enjoying a life of pleasure and plenty. As 
such, as far as the worldly consequences of adopting a particular moral attitude 
are concerned, the disbelievers in the Hereafter cannot be satisfied whether it 
is right or wrong. In view of this, those who deny the Hereafter, do not see any 
need to consider an invitation to faith and morality even if it is presented in 
a most forceful way." <br><br>22"The Fire will see them" The words used in the 
Text may be metaphorical, or they may mean that the Fire of Hell will be endowed 
with the faculties of seeing, thinking and judging.<br><br>23Literally: "It is a 
promise whose fulfillment can be demanded (from Allah)".<br><br>Here one ma ask 
the question: How can the promise of the Garden and the threat of the Fire 
produce any effect on the attitude of a parson who denies Resurrection and the 
existence of Paradise and Hell? In order to understand the wisdom of this method 
of admonition, one should keep in view that it is meant to appeal to the 
self-interest of an obdurate person, who does not otherwise listen to such 
arguments. This is, as if to say, "Even if, for the sake of argument, there is 
no proof of the reality of the life-after-death, there is also no proof that 
such an event will not occur at all, and there is a possibility for both. In the 
latter case, the Believer and the disbeliever both will be in one and the same 
position, but if there is life in the Hereafter, as the Prophet asserts, then 
the disbelievers will be doomed to utter ruin". Therefore, such an approach 
breaks the stubbornness of the disbelievers and proves to be highly effective 
when the entire scene of Resurrection gathering of the people, their 
accountability and of Hell and Heaven is presented in a vivid manner as if the 
Prophet had himself seen it with his own eyes. Fur further explanation, see Ha 
Mim Sajdah: 52 and E. N. 69 thereof, and A I-Ahqaf: 10.<br><br>24Here, deities 
do not mean idols but the angels, the prophets; the saints, the martyrs and the 
pious men, whom the mushriks of different communities have made their deities.
<br><br>25Such dialogues between Allah and the gods of the disbelievers occur at 
several places in the Qur'an. For instance, in Surah Saba it has been stated: 
"On the day when He will gather them all together, He will ask the angels, 'Did 
these people worship you?' They will answer, `Glory be to Thee! Thou art our 
Patron and not they: they in fact worshiped the jinns (that is, satans); most of 
these believed in them." (vv. 40-41). Similarly in Surah Al-Ma'idah, it is 
said:" And when Allah will say "O Jesus, son of Mary, did you ever say to the 
people: `Make me and my mother gods instead of Allah?' He will answer, `Glory be 
to Thee ! It did not behoove me to say that which I had no right to say...I told 
them only that which Thou didst bid me: 'Worship Allah, Who is my Lord as well 
as your Lord'." (vv. 116, 117). <br><br>26That is, "They were mean people: You 
gave them all the provisions of life so that they may show gratitude to You, but 
they became ungrateful and ignored all the admonitions given by the Prophets. "<br>
<br>27That is, "On that Day your religion, which you now believe, to be true. 
will prove to be false and even your gods, whom you yourselves have set up,' 
will declare it to be a lie; for none of them ever asked you to make them your 
deities and worship them as such. Consequently, instead of interceding on your 
behalf; they will bear witness against you."<br><br>28"... who will be guilty of 
iniquity ...": " .... who will be unjust to the Reality and the Truth and guilty 
of disbelief and shirk "The context shows that those who reject the Prophet and 
set up other deities instead of Allah and deny life in the Hereafter, are guilty 
of zulm (iniquity).<br><br>29This is an answer to the objection of the 
disbelievers of Makkah that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) could not be a 
Messenger of Allah because he ate food and moved about in the streets. They have 
been told that all the Messengers of Allah who came before Muhammad (Allah's 
peace be upon him)like Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Moses and many others whom they 
knew and acknowledged as Prophets and Messengers of Allah also ate food and 
walked about in the streets. Nay, even Prophet Jesus, son of Mary, himself, whom 
the Christians had made the son of God (and whose image had also been placed in 
the Ka`bah by the disbelievers of Makkah) ate food and walked about in the 
streets like a common man even according to the Gospels themselves.<br><br>30It 
is obvious that the Messenger and the Believers were a test for the disbelievers 
as to whether they would believe even after hearing the Divine Message and 
seeing their pure character. On the other hand, the disbelievers were a test for 
the Messenger and his followers in the sense that they were a means of proving 
and trying their true Faith by their persecution. For it is this test alone 
which helps to discriminate the true Believers from the hypocrites. That is why, 
at first, only the poor arid the helpless but sincere people embraced Islam. Had 
there been no persecution and hardships but prosperity, wealth and grandeur, the 
worshipers of the world and the selfish people would have been the first to 
embrace Islam.<br><br>31That is, "Now when you have understood the wisdom of the 
test by persecution, it is hoped that you will endure all kinds of hardships 
without complaint, and willingly undergo the persecutions that are inevitable."<br>
<br>32It probably means two things: First, the way your Lord is conducting your 
affairs, is according to His will and nothing that happens is without His 
knowledge. Second, He is fully aware of your sincerity and righteousness in 
serving His cause under all kinds of hardships. You should therefore rest 
assured that you will have your full reward. He also sees the persecution and 
iniquity of the disbelievers; therefore they will not escape the consequences of 
their wickedness.<br><br>33That is, "If Allah had really intended to convey His 
Message to us, He would not have chosen a prophet and sent an angel only to him, 
but to each one of us individually with the guidance, or He should have sent a 
deputation of angels to appear before the people with the Message". The same 
objection has been stated in Surah Al-An`am thus: "When a Revelation comes 
before them, they say, `We will not believe in it unless we are given the like 
of what has been given to the Messengers of Allah.' Allah knows best whom to 
entrust with His Mission and how it should be enforced." (v. 124) appeal .<br>
<br>34That is, Allah Himself should appear before us and make the appeal.<br>
<br>35Another translation could be: "They have formed a very high opinion of 
their own selves."<br><br>36This very theme has been expressed in much greater 
detail in Al An'am: 8, Al-Hijr: 7-8 and 51-64, and also in Bani Isra`il: 90-95.<br>
<br>37For explanation, see Ibrahim: 18 and E. N.'s 25, 26 thereof. <br><br>38In 
contrast to the miserable plight of the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection, 
the Believers will be protected from the hardships of that Day; they will be 
treated with honor and will have a blissful place for midday rest. According to 
a Tradition, the Holy Prophet said: "I declare on oath by Allah, in Whose hand 
is my life, that the long, horrible Day of Resurrection will be made very short 
and light for a Believer, as short and light as the time taken in offering an 
obligatory Prayer." (Musnad Ahmad).<br><br>39That is, "On that Day all other 
kingdoms, which deluded man in the world, will come to an end, and there will be 
only the Kingdom of Allah, Who is the real Sovereign of the universe. In Surah 
Mu'min: 16, the same thing has been stated thus: "On that Day when all the 
people will stand exposed, and nothing of them will be hidden from Allah, it 
will be asked, `Whose is the Sovereignty today?' The response from every side 
will he: `Of Allah, the Almighty'." According to a Tradition, the Holy Prophet 
said, "Allah will take the heavens in one hand and the earth in the other, and 
will declare: `I am the Sovereign: I am the Ruler. Where are the other rulers of 
the earth? Where are those tyrants`? Where are the arrogant people?" (Musnad 
Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, and Abu Da'ud, with slight variations).<br><br>40"Satan 
has proved very treacherous to man" may also be a part of the disbelievers' 
lament, or it may be a remark by Allah, in which case the meaning will be: "And 
Satan is indeed the one who always deceives man."<br><br>41The Arabic word 
mahjur is capable of several meanings. As such, the sentence may mean:" "these 
people did not regard the Qur'an as worthy of their consideration: they neither 
accepted it nor followed it"; or "They considered it to be a nonsense or the 
delirium of insanity: or "They made it the target of their ridicule and 
mockery."<br><br>42That is, "It is not a new thing that the disbelievers have 
become your enemies, for it has always been so with all the former Prophets and 
Messengers. (See also Al-An'am: 112-113). This is inevitable because it is Our 
Law that the criminals will always oppose the Truth. You should, therefore, 
pursue your mission with full confidence and determination without expecting any 
immediate results.<br><br>43"Guidance" does not only imply bestowing of the 
knowledge of the Truth, but it also means giving the right guidance at the right 
time to guide the Islamic Movement on the right lines and to defeat the strategy 
and scheme of the enemies of Islam "Help" means all kinds of moral, spiritual 
and material help to the followers of the Truth in their conflict against 
falsehood. Thus, Allah is All Sufficient for the righteous people and they need 
no other support provided they have full faith in Allah and fight falsehood with 
all their energies and strength.<br><br>This meant to encourage the Holy 
Prophet, otherwise the previous assertion would have been very discouraging 
without this. It meant to say, "Even :f the unbelievers have become your 
enemies, you should continue your mission, for We shall guide you in every stage 
and situation and help you against them. We shall defeat all the schemes of your 
enemies and help you in every way in your conflict with falsehood. We shall 
provide you with material means also, but you should trust in Us and exert your 
utmost against falsehood."<br><br>44As the disbelievers of Makkah considered 
this objection to be very strong, they repeated it over and over again. The 
Qur'an also has cited it with its answer at several places; for instance, see 
E.N.'s 101-106 of Surah An-Naml and E.N. 119 of Bani Isra'il. Their question 
implied: "Had the Qur'an been really the Word of Allah, it would have been sent 
as a complete book all at once; for Allah has the knowledge of everything and 
every human affair. Thus it is obvious that nothing is being sent down from 
above; but this man himself fabricates all its themes or gets these from other 
people or other books.<br><br>45Another translation can be: "So that by it We 
may strengthen your heart and imbue it with courage." The words are 
comprehensive and imply both the meanings. This concise sentence contains the 
following explanation why the Qur'an was revealed piecemeal by degrees:<br><br>
(1) So that the Holy Prophet may commit it to memory perfectly and recite it to 
his people, who are illiterate, rather than present it in a written form.<br>
<br>(2) So that its teachings and messages may be impressed deeply on the minds.<br>
<br>(3) So that the way of life it teaches, may be followed with complete 
conviction, which would not be possible if all the Commandments and the whole 
system of life had been sent down all at once.<br><br>(4) So that the hearts of 
the Prophet and his followers may be imbued with courage during the conflict 
between the Truth and falsehood. This required that the Divine Guidance and 
messages of encouragement should be revealed as and when needed according to the 
practical situation. Obviously, this could not have been possible if these had 
been sent down all at once. This also showed that Allah had not left His 
Messenger alone amidst persecution to counter all sorts of resistance and 
opposition after appointing him to the mission, but He Himself was watching the 
struggle with concern and guiding His Prophet through every difficulty by direct 
communion in every critical situation.<br><br>46This is yet another point of 
wisdom of sending down the Qur'an by degrees. Allah did not intend to produce a 
book on "Guidance" and spread its teachings through the agency of His Prophet. 
Had it been so the disbelievers would have been justified in their objection as 
to why the Qur'an had not been sent down as a complete book all at once. The 
real object of the revelation of the Qur'an was that Allah intended to start a 
Movement of faith, piety and righteousness to combat disbelief, ignorance and 
sin, and He had raised a Prophet to lead and guide the Movement. Then, on the 
one hand, Allah had taken it upon Himself to send necessary instructions and 
guidance to the leader and his followers as and when needed, and on the other, 
He had also taken the responsibility to answer the objections and remove the 
doubts of opponents and give the right interpretation of things which they 
misunderstood. Thus the Qur'an was the collection of the different discourses 
that were being revealed by Allah; it was not merely meant to be a code of laws 
or of moral principles, but a Book, which was being sent down piecemeal to guide 
the Movement in all its stages to suit its requirements on different occasions. 
(See also Introduction: The Meaning of the Qur'an, Vol. I, pp. 9- 18). <br><br>
47That is, "They will be driven towards Hell upon their faces because of their 
perversion and their perverted thinking."<br><br>48Here by "the Book" is not 
meant the Torah, which was given to Prophet Moses after the exodus from Egypt, 
but it implies that Divine Guidance which was given to him after his appointment 
as a Prophet up to the Exodus. It included the orations delivered by him in the 
court of Pharaoh and also the instructions given to him during his conflict with 
Pharaoh as mentioned in the Qur'an here and there. Most probably, these things 
were not included in the Torah; the Torah began with the Ten Commandments which 
were given to Moses engraved on stone tablets on Mount Sinai after the Exodus.<br>
<br>49"Revelations": The Divine teachings which had reached them through 
Prophets Jacob and Joseph, and which had been preached to them by the righteous 
people of Israel for centuries <br><br>50They did not charge only Prophet Noah 
with imposture because he was a man, but, in fact, charged all the Prophets with 
imposture because they were all human beings.<br><br>51That is, a painful 
chastisement in the Hereafter.<br><br>52There is no definite knowledge about 
"the people of the Raas'' . Different commentators have said different things 
about them, but nothing is convincing. The only thing that may be said about 
them is that they were a people who had killed their Prophet by throwing him 
into or hanging him down a "Rass " (an old or dry well).<br><br>53The habitation 
referred to was that of the people of Prophet Lot, which was destroyed by a rain 
of stones. The people of Hijaz while traveling to Palestine and Syria, passed by 
its ruins and heard the horrible tales of its destruction.<br><br>54As the 
disbelievers did not believe in the Hereafter, they looked at these ancient 
ruins as mere spectators and did not take any warning from them. Incidentally, 
this is the difference between the observation of a disbeliever and of a 
Believer in the Hereafter: the former looks at such things as a mere spectator 
or at the most as an archaeologist whereas the latter learns moral lessons from 
the same and obtains an insight into the realities beyond this worldly life.<br>
<br>55Obviously there is a contradiction between the question posed by the 
disbelievers and the assertion made by them about their deities. The question 
was meant to bring the Holy Prophet into contempt, as if to say, "You are making 
a claim that is far above your low position." On the other hand, their assertion 
shows that ,they indirectly admitted the force of the arguments and the high 
character of the Holy Prophet and were even afraid of the effectiveness and 
success of his Message, because, according to them, it was going to turn them 
away from their false gods. <br><br>56"...the person who makes his lust his god" 
is the one who becomes the slave of his lusts and desires. As he serves his lust 
like the one who warships ' his deity, he becomes as much guilty of .shirk as 
the one who worships an idol. According to a Tradition, related by Hadrat Abu 
Hurairah, the Holy Prophet said, "Of all the false gods being worshipped and 
served, instead of Allah, the worst in the sight of Allah is one's own lust." 
(Tabarani). For further explanation, see E.N. 50 of Al-Kahf,<br><br>The man who 
keeps his desires under control, and uses his common sense to make decisions, 
can be expected to come to the right path by making an appeal to his reason even 
though he might have been involved in shirk or disbelief; for if. he decides to 
follow the right way he will remain firm and steadfast on it. On the other hand, 
the man who is the slave of his own lust, is like a ship without an anchor, who 
wanders about on any path where his lust leads him. He is least bothered about 
the distinction between the right and the wrong, the true and the false, and has 
no desire to choose one against the other. And, if ar all, such a person is 
persuaded to accept the message of Guidance, no one can take the responsibility 
that he will observe any moral laws.<br><br>57"They are only like the cattle" 
because they follow their lusts blindly. Just as the sheep and cattle do not 
know where their driver is taking them, to the meadow or to the slaughter house, 
so are these people also following their leaders blindly without knowing or 
judging where they are being led-to success or to destruction.. The only 
difference between the two is that the cattle have no intelligence and will not 
be accountable as to the place where they are being taken by the driver. But it 
is a pity that human beings who are endowed with reason, should behave like 
cattle; therefore their condition is worse than that of cattle.<br><br>
Incidentally it should be noted that this passage (w . 43, 44) is not meant to 
dissuade the Holy Prophet from conveying the Message to such people, but it is 
an indirect warning to the disbelievers of the consequences if they continued to 
behave like cattle .<br><br>58The word dalil has been used in the sense of the 
"pilot", who is a person trained to take ships safely in or out of a harbor, or 
along a waterway. The sun has been trade the pilot of the shadow because the 
lengthening out of the shadow and its being rolled up depends on the rising, 
declining and setting of the sun. <br><br>59"We roll it up......Curselves": "We 
annihilate it or cause it to disappear", for everything which is annihilated 
returns to Allah, because everything comes from Elim and returns to Him.<br><br>
The Qur'an has used the phenomenon of the shadow caused by the sun for two 
purposes. (fit is taken literally, it is meant to warn the disbelievers that 
they should learn a lesson from this and should not behave like cattle, as if to 
say, "If you had considered the benefits of the shadow in regard to your 
everyday experience, you would have accepted without any hesitation the Doctrine 
of Tauhid. Had the shadow been constant, there would have been no life en earth, 
for life depends on the light and heat of the sun. On the other hand, if there 
had been no shadow at all, the constant heat and light of the sun would have 
made life impossible. Besides this, if there had been sudden changes in the sun 
and the shadow, they would not have been able to endure it for long; therefore 
you should reflect on this phenomenon and understand it well that it has been so 
ordained by the All-Wise and the All-Powerful Creator so that it always 
increases or decreases gradually in accordance with fixed natural laws. Thus it 
is obvious that it could not have come into existence by itself nor produced by 
blind mechanisms nor functioned so regularly and continuously under many 
independent gods."<br><br>But if it is taken in the metaphorical sense, there is 
between the lines a subtle suggestion, and it is this: Just as the shadow does 
not remain in one and the same state, likewise the shadow of disbelief and 
shirk, which appears to have spread far and wide, will begin to shorten as the 
"Sun" of Guidance gradually rises; but it requires patience, for Allah never 
brings about sudden changes.<br><br>60The night is a "garment" in the sense that 
it covers and hides things.<br><br>61This verse has three objects:<br><br>(1) It 
provides a proof of Tauhid,<br><br>(2) It furnishes a proof of the possibility 
of life-after-death from everyday human experience, and<br><br>(3) It bears the 
good news that the night of ignorance has come to an end and now the bright day 
of Knowledge and Guidance has dawned. It is therefore inevitable that those who 
were sleeping the sleep of ignorance, will sooner or later wake up, but those 
who have slept the sleep of death, will not wake up and will themselves be 
deprived of life, while the business of the day will go on thriving even without 
them.<br><br>62That is, such water as is pure and free from all sorts of 
impurities, germs and poison, which cleanses and washes away filth and becomes a 
source of life for men, beasts as well as all kinds of plant life.<br><br>63This 
verse also gives proofs of the Doctrine of Tauhid and the Hereafter. Besides, it 
contains a subtle suggestion that the period of the "drought" of ignorance has 
been replaced through Allah's mercy by the "blessed rain" of Prophethood, which 
is showering the life-giving knowledge of Revelation from which many servants of 
Allah will certainly benefit, if not all .<br><br>64"We present...before them" 
may have three meanings:<br><br>(1)"We have cited the phenomenon of rainfall 
over and over again in the Qur'an in order to make plain to them the Reality."<br>
<br>(2) "We are time and again showing them the wonderful phenomenon of the heat 
and drought, seasonal winds and clouds, rainfall and its life producing 
effects."<br><br>(3) "We go on changing the system of the distribution of 
rainfall throughout the , world year after year, so that the same place does not 
receive the same amount of rainfall every time: sometimes a place is left 
completely dry, another has more or less of rainfall than usual, while some 
other is flooded with rain water. They see all these different phenomena with 
their countless different results in their daily life." <br><br>65The verse 
means to impress that the wonderful system of rainfall is by itself a proof of 
the existence of Allah, of One Lord of the universe, and of His attributes. Its 
wonderful distribution during the year and over different parts of the earth is 
a clear proof that there is an All-Wise Designer. But the obdurate disbelievers 
do not learn any lesson from it, and persist in their ingratitude, though this 
has been cited in the Qur'an repeatedly for this purpose.<br><br>It is also a 
proof of the life-after-death, for the disbelievers themselves see and again 
that rainfall brings to life dead land year after year. This clearly that Allah 
has the power to bring the dead back to life, but the disbelievers it time 
proves do not learn any lesson from it and persist in their irresponsible ways.<br>
<br>If verse 48 is taken in the metaphorical sense, the "pure water" of rain 
will mean the blessings of Prophet hood. Human history shows that whenever this 
blessing as been sent down, ignorance has been replaced by knowledge, injustice 
by justice and wickedness by righteousness. The coming of Prophets has always 
proved to be the harbinger of a moral revolution. But only those who accepted 
their guidance benefited from it. This is the lesson of history, yet the 
disbelievers reject it because of their ingratitude.<br><br>66That is, "If We 
had willed, We could have sent a separate Prophet to every habitation but We did 
not do so, because like the sun, Our Last Prophet suffices to enlighten the 
whole world."<br><br>67The Arabic words Jihad-i-Kabir imply three meanings:<br>
<br>(1) To exert one's utmost for the cause of Islam,<br><br>(2) To dedicate all 
one's resources to this cause, and<br><br>(3) To tight against the enemies of 
Islam on all possible fronts with all one's resources in order to raise high the 
"Word of Allah". This will include jihad with one's tongue, pen, wealth, life 
and every other available weapon.<br><br>68This phenomenon has been perceived in 
many places in the sea and on the land that sweet water and bitter water has 
existed side by side. Turkish Admiral Syedi Ali Ra'is, in his book Mir 
'at-al-Mamalik, written in the 16th century, has mentioned a place in the 
Persian Gulf, where springs of sweet waver exist under the bitter waters of the 
sea, where he could get drinking water for his fleet. The American Oil Company 
at first obtained water from the same springs in the Persian Gulf, before they 
dug up wells near Dhahran for supply of drinking water. Near Bahrain also there 
exist springs of sweet water at the sea bed from which people have been taking 
water until quite recently. Besides this apparent meaning which gives a rational 
proof of Allah's being the One and the only Lord of the universe, the verse 
contains a subtle suggestion as well: When Allah wills, He can raise up a 
righteous community from among a large wicked society just as He can cause 
springs of palatable and sweet water to gush out from under the salty waters of 
the sea.<br><br>69Here the miracle of the birth of man from a mere sperm drop 
and the procreation of his offspring from man and woman have been cited as a 
proof of Tauhid. Though both man and woman belong to the same genus, they are 
two species, having important common human characteristics but different 
physical structures and psychological traits. It is a proof of Tauhid that the 
All-Powerful Allah has used this "difference" for making the two as complements 
and not antagonists. ' It is also the design of the All-Powerful Creator that He 
is creating sons and daughters in the world in due proportion Then the sons 
marry and create blood relationships, and the daughters are married and become 
means of forming new relationships. This process goes on widening to produce 
families, tribes and nations belonging to the same race and bound by the same 
civilization.<br><br>The verse has also a subtle suggestion: The whole of life 
is being run on the principle of "difference", for example, the difference 
between the night and the day, the summer and the winter, etc. Therefore, " O 
Muslims, you should patiently endure the differences you are having with your 
opponents for these are certain to produce good results."<br><br>70This is a 
characteristic of the typical disbeliever: he is a helper and defender of all 
those who are rebels against Allah and an enemy of all those who may he striving 
to raise Allah's Word and enforce His Law in the world; he is associated 
directly or indirectly with all the works of Allah's disobedience and opposes 
and resists in one way or the other every effort that is made to bring people to 
the path of Allah's obedience and service.<br><br>71This verse (56) was meant to 
comfort the Holy Prophet and to warn the disbelievers who opposed him and 
obstructed his work, as if to say, "Your duty is only to convey the Message of 
good news to the people and to warn them of the consequences of disbelief: you 
are not responsible as to whether they accept .your Message or reject it, or to 
reward the Believers and punish the disbelievers."<br><br>Such words occur in 
the Qur'an at other places also and are obviously directed to the disbelievers, 
as if to say, "The Message of the Prophet is meant to reform the people without 
any tinge of selfishness. As he does not force the people to accept his Message, 
there is no reason why you should feel offended. If you accept the Message, it 
will be for your own good, and if you reject it, you will be harming yourselves 
alone. For after conveying the Message, he is relieved of his duty and 
responsibility; then the matter will be between you and Us."<br><br>Although 
this is a very simple and clear interpretation of verse 56 (and of similar other 
verses), yet some people erroneously conclude from it that the only duty and 
responsibility of the Prophet is to convey the Message and nothing else. They 
forget that the Qur'an has stressed over and over again that the Prophet is not 
only a giver of good news to the Believers but he is also their teacher, their 
lawgiver, judge and guide, a purifier of their morals and a model of life for 
them, and that every word which he utters is law which they have to obey and 
follow willingly in all walks of life and for all times to come.<br><br>71aFor 
explanation, see E.N. 70 of Al-Mu'minun.<br><br>72For explanation of "Throne", 
see E.N.'s 41, 42 of Al-A'raf, E.N. 4 of Yunus, and E.N. 7 of Hud.<br><br>It is 
difficult to say what exactly is mean by "six days" Here a "day" thay mean a 
period of time or an ordinary day of this world. For explanation of the "day", 
see E.N.'s 11 to 15 of Surah Ha Mim Sajdah.<br><br>73This they said due to their 
arrogance and stubbornness just as Pharaoh had said to Prophet Moses: "What is 
the Lord of the universe?" For the disbelievers of Makkah were not unaware of 
the Merciful (Rahman), nor was Pharaoh unaware of the "Lord of the universe". 
The wording of the verse itself chows that their question about the "Merciful" 
was not the result of their ignorance of Him but was due to their 
rebelliousness; otherwise Allah would not have punished them for this but would 
have informed them politely that He Himself is "Merciful". Besides this, it is 
well known historically that the word Rahman (Merciful) for Allah had been in 
common usage in Arabia since the ancient times. Please see also E.N. 5 of 
As-Sajdah and E.N. 35 of Saba. <br><br>74All scholars are agreed that here a 
`Prostration of Recital' (Sajdah Talawat) has been enjoined, which means that 
every reader and every hearer must prostrate himself on reciting or hearing the 
recital of this verse. According to traditions, the one who hears this verse 
being recited should say: Zadan Allahu, khudu an-anima zada, lil-a`daa-i nufura: 
"May Allah increase us in humility even as the enemies are increased in their 
hatred."<br><br>75See E.N.'s 8 to 12 of Al Hijr. <br><br>76That is, the sun, as 
mentioned clearly in Surah Nuh: 16: "... and made the sun a lamp."<br><br>77The 
observation and deep consideration of the wonderful phenomenon of the 
alternation of the day and night is a proof of Tauhid and His Providence so that 
man may feel grateful to Him and prostrate himself before Him in all humility.<br>
<br>78That is, "Though all human beings are by birth the servants of the 
Merciful before Whom you have been invited to prostrate yourselves, and which 
you disdain, his true servants are those who adopt the way of His obedience 
consciously and develop such desirable characteristics. Then the natural 
consequences of the prostration are those found in the lives of the Believers 
and the evil results of rejecting the invitation, those found in your lives." 
Here attention is being drawn to the two patterns of character and life: first 
of those who had accepted the Message of the Holy Prophet and were following it, 
and the second of those who persisted in the ways of ignorance. Here only the 
prominent characteristics of the true Believers have been cited, and for 
contrast, the characteristics of the disbelievers have been left to every 
discerning eye and mind which could see them all around in society and make its 
own decision. <br><br>79That is; "They do not walk haughtily and arrogantly like 
the tyrants and mischief-makers, but their "gait" is of a gentle, right-thinking 
and good natured person." "Walking humbly" does not mean walking like a weak or 
sick person, nor does it imply the gait of a hypocrite who walks ostentatiously 
to show humility or fear of God. According to Traditions, the Holy Prophet 
himself used to walk with firm, quick steps. One day Caliph `Umar saw a young 
man walking slowly like a weak, sick person, and asked him, "Are you ill?" When 
the man replied in the negative, the Caliph raised his whip, rebuked him and 
told him to walk like a healthy man. This shows that the "humble gait" is the 
natural gait of a noble and gentle person and not a gait which shows weakness 
and undue humility.<br><br>In this connection, the first characteristic of the 
true servants of Allah to which attention has been drawn, is their "gait" This 
is because the gait indicates the character of an individual. If a man walks in 
a humble and dignified way, as opposed to a haughty, vain and proud manner, it 
shows that he is a noble and gentle person. Thus the different "gaits" of the 
different types of people show what sort of characters they possess. The verse 
means to imply that the true servants of the Merciful can be easily recognized 
by their "gait" among the people. Their attitude of Allah's worship and 
obedience has changed them so thoroughly that it can "be seen at first sight 
from their "gate that they are noble, humble and good natured people, who cannot 
be expected to indulge in any mischief. For further explanation, see E.N.43 of 
Bani Isra'il and E.N 33 of Luqman <br><br>80"Ignorant people": Rude and insolent 
people and not uneducated and illiterate ones. The true servants of the 
"Merciful" do not believe in "vengeance", even though they may have to deal with 
the ignorant people who behave rudely and insolently towards them. If they 
happen to come across such people, they wish them peace and turn away. The same 
thing has been expressed in AI-Qasas: 55, thus: "And when they hear something 
vain and absurd they turn away from it, saying, `Our deeds are for us and your 
deeds are for you: peace be to you: we have nothing to do with the ignorant'." 
For details see E.N.'s 72 to 78 of Al-Qasas. <br><br>81That is, they neither 
spend their nights in fun and merry-making nor in gossips and telling tales, nor 
in doing wicked deeds, for these are the ways of the ignorant people. The true 
servants of Allah pass their nights in worshipping and remembering Him as much 
as they can. This characteristic of theirs has been brought out clearly at 
several places in the Qur'an, thus: "their backs forsake their beds and they 
invoke their Lord in fear and in hope." (As-Sajdah: 16). "These people (of 
Paradise) slept but little at night, and prayed for their forgiveness in the 
hours of the morning." (Az-Zariyat: 17, 18). And: "Can the end of the one, who 
is obedient to Allah, prostrates himself and stands before Him during the hours 
of the night, fears the Hereafter and places his hope in the mercy of his Lord, 
be like that of a mushrik;'" (Az-Zumar: 9). <br><br>82That is, their worship has 
not made them vain and proud to presume that they are the beloved ones of Allah 
and that the Fire of Hell will not touch them. On the other hand, in spite of 
all their worship and good deeds, they are so tilled with the fear of the 
torment of Hell that they pray to their Lord to save them from it, for they do 
not depend upon their own work for success in the Hereafter but upon the mercy 
of Allah.<br><br>83The true servants of Allah adopt "the golden mean" between 
the two extremes in spending their money. They neither go beyond prudence and 
necessity in expenditure nor live in wretched 'circumstances in order to save 
and hoard money but are frugal. This was the characteristic of the followers of 
the Holy Prophet, which distinguished them from the well-to-do people of Arabia, 
who were either spend-thrifts in regard to the gratification of their own lusts 
or niggardly in spending their money on good works.<br><br>According to Islam 
extravagance is: (1) To spend even the smallest amount of money in unlawful 
ways, (2) to go beyond one's own resources in expenditure even in lawful ways, 
or to spend money for one's own pleasure, and (3) to spend money in righteous 
ways not for the sake of Allah but for mere show. On the other hand, one is 
miserly if one does not spend money for one's own needs and requirements and 
those of one's family in accordance with one's resources and position, or if one 
does not spend money for good works. The way taught by Islam is the golden mean 
between the two extremes. The Holy Prophet has said, "It is a sign of wisdom to 
adopt the "golden mean" in one's living." (Ahmad, Tabarani).<br><br>84The true 
servants refrain from three great sins: Shirk, murder and adultery. The Holy 
Prophet himself warned of their gravity. According to 'Abdullah bin Mas`ud, when 
some one asked him about the worst sins, he replied, (1) "It is to set up 
someone as equal in rank with Allah, Who has created you, (2) to kill your own 
child for fear of its sustenance, and (3) to commit adultery with the wife of 
your neighbour." (Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmizi, Nasa`i, Ahmad). Obviously this is 
not a complete list of the "heinous sins". But these three instances have been 
cited because they were most prevalent in the Arab society of those days .<br>
<br>As regards the inclusion of refraining from shirk among the excellences of 
the true servants, one may ask why it should be presented as virtue before the 
disbelievers who did not regard shirk as a vice. It is because the Arabs had 
doubts about the doctrine of shirk even though they appeared to be deeply 
involved in it. This is amply supported by their history. For instance, when 
Abraha invaded Makkah, the Quraish did not invoke their idols to save the Ka`bah 
from him, but they begged Allah to save it. Their contemporary poetry bears 
sufficient evidence that they regarded the destruction of the "people of the 
elephant" due to Allah's power and supernatural interference and not due to any 
help of their idols. The Quraish and the polytheists of Arabia had also come to 
know that when Abraha reached Ta`if on his way to Makkah, the people of Ta`if 
had offered him their services to destroy the Ka`bah and had even provided him 
guides to take him safely to Makkah through the hills, for fear that he might 
also destroy the temple of "Lat", their chief deity. This event so much offended 
the Arabs that for years after this they continued , pelting the grave of the 
chief guide with stones for retaliation. Moreover, the Quraish and the other 
Arabs attributed their creed to Prophet Abraham and looked upon their religious 
and social customs and their Hajj rites as part of Abraham's religion. They knew 
that Prophet Abraham was a worshiper 'of Allah and not of idols. They also had 
traditions to show as to when they had started idol-worship, and which idol had 
been brought from where, when and by whom. The fact is that the common Arab did 
not have much of reverence for his idols. He would even speak insultingly of it 
and withheld his offerings when it failed to fulfil his wishes and prayers. For 
instance, there is the story of an Arab who wanted to avenge the murder of his 
father. He went to the temple of his idol, Zul-Khalasah, and wanted to take an 
omen. The response came that he should abandon his intention. At this the Arab 
became furious and cried out: 'O Zul-Khalasah! Had you been in my place, and 
your father was murdered, you would not have said that the murderers should not 
be punished." Another Arab took his herd of camels to the shrine of his god, 
named Sa'd, for seeking its blessings. It was a tall idol which had been smeared 
with sacrificial blood. On seeing it, the camels became terrified and started 
running in all directions. The Arab was so filled with rage that he started 
pelting the idol with stones, shouting, "May God destroy you! I had come to you 
to seek blessings for my camels, but you have deprived me of all of them." There 
were certain idols about whose origin filthy stories were current. For instance, 
the story about Asaf and Na'ilah whose images had been placed at Safa and Marwa, 
was that they were actually a man and a woman, who had committed adultery inside 
the Holy Ka`bah and had been turned into stone by God as a punishment. When the 
deities had such reputation, no worshiper could cherish any reverence for them 
in his heart. From this one can easily understand that the Arabs did recognize 
the value of true God-worship deep in their hearts, but, on the one hand, it had 
been suppressed by ancient customs and ways of ignorance, and on the other, the 
priestly class among the Quraish had vested interests, who were busy creating 
prejudices against it among the people. They could not give up idol-worship 
because such a step would have brought to an end their supremacy in Arabia. That 
is why, refraining from shirk and worship of One Allah has been mentioned as a 
mark of superiority of the followers of the Holy Prophet without any fear of 
contradiction by the disbelievers, for even they in their heart of hearts knew 
that it was a weighty argument against them. <br><br>85This can have two 
meanings: (1) His punishment will never come to an end, but it will continue 
being inflicted relentlessly over and over again; and (2) the person who in 
addition to the sins of disbelief, shirk and atheism, would have committed 
murders, adultery and other sins, will get separate punishment for rebellion and 
for each other sin. He will be accountable for each of his major and minor sins 
none of which will be pardoned. For instance, for each murder and for each act 
of adultery he will be given a separate punishment, and likewise, there will be 
a separate punishment for every sin committed by him. <br><br>86This is a good 
news for those people who repented and reformed themselves, for they will have 
the benefit of the "general amnesty" contained in verse 70. This was regarded as 
a great blessing by the true servants because very few of those who embraced 
Islam had been free from those vices during their 'ignorance', and were 
terrified by the threat contained in vv. 63-69, but this amnesty not only 
redeemed them but filled them with hope.<br><br>Many instances of such people, 
who sincerely repented and reformed their lives, have been related in the 
traditions. For instance, Ibn Jarir and Tabarani have related an incident from 
Hadrat Abu Hurairah, who savs, "One day when 1 returned home after offering the 
'lsha prayer in the Prophet's Mosque, I saw a woman standing at my door. I 
saluted her and walked into my room, closed the door and busied myself in 
voluntary worship. After a while she knocked at the door. I opened the door and 
asked what she wanted. She said that she had come with a problem: She had 
committed zina, had become pregnant, given birth to a child and then killed it. 
She wanted to know if there was any chance of her sin being forgiven. I replied 
in the negative. She went back grief-stricken, exclaiming, "Ah! this beautiful 
body was created for the fire!" The next morning, after the prayer, when I 
related the night's incident before the Holy Prophet, he said, "You gave a very 
wrong answer, Abu Hurairah: Haven't you read the Qur'anic verse which says: 
'(Those) who do not invoke any other deity than Allah...except the one who may 
have repented (after those sins) and have believed and done righteous deeds' `?" 
Hearing this from the Holy Prophet, I went out in search of the woman, and had 
her traced again at the `Isha time. I gave her the good news and told her what 
the Holy Prophet had said in reply to her question. She immediately tell 
prostrate on the ground and thanked Allah, Who had opened a way for her 
forgiveness. Then she offered repentance and set a slave-girl, along with her 
son, tree." A similar incident about an old man has been related in the 
traditions. He came before the Holy Prophet and said, "O Messenger of Allah, all 
my life has passed in sin: there is no sin which I have not committed; so much 
so that if my sins were to be distributed over the people of the whole world, 
they would all be doomed. Is there any way out for my forgiveness?" The Holy 
Prophet asked him, "Have you embraced Islam?" He said, "I bear witness that 
there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." The 
Holy Prophet said, "Go back, Allah is All-Forgiving and has the power to change 
your evil deeds into good deeds." He asked,"Is it about all my crimes and 
errors?'' The Holy Prophet replied, "Yes, it is about all your crimes and 
errors." ( Ibn Kathir) .<br><br>87It has two meanings: (1) When he has repented 
sincerely, he will start a new life of belief and obedience to Allah and by His 
grace and help will start doing good deeds instead of evil deeds that he used to 
do in his life of unbelief, and his evil deeds will be replaced by good deeds; 
and (2) Not only will his evil deeds done in the past be written off, but it 
will also be recorded in his conduct register that he was the servant who gave 
up rebellion against his Lord and adopted the way of His obedience. Then, as he 
will feel more and more sorry for his past sins and offer repentance, more and 
more good deeds will be credited to him; for repenting of one's wrong doing and 
seeking forgiveness is in itself a good deed. Thus, good deeds will supersede 
all his evil deeds in his conduct register, and he will not only escape 
punishment in the Hereafter but, in addition, he will also be blessed with high 
favors by Allah.<br><br>88That is. ultimately everyone has to return to Allah 
for Allah alone is man's last and real refuge: He alone can reward one for his 
good deeds or punish one for his evil deeds: He alone is All-Merciful and All 
Compassionate, Who receives the penitent with forgiveness and Who does not 
rebuke him for his past errors provided that he has repented sincerely, and 
adopted the right attitude and reformed himself. <br><br>89This also has two 
meanings: (1) They do not give evidence ( in a law court etc.) in regard to a 
false thing in order to prove it right, when in tact it is a falsehood, or at 
best a doubtful thing; and (2) they have no intention to witness any thing which 
is false, evil or wicked as spectators. In this sense, every sin and every 
indecency, every sham and counterfeit act is a falsehood. A true servant of 
Allah recognizes it as false and shuns it even if it is presented in the 
seemingly beautiful forms of "art" .<br><br>90The Arabic word laghv implies all 
that is vain, useless and meaningless and it also covers "falsehood". The true 
servants pass by in a dignified manner if ever they come across "what is vain", 
as if it were a heap of tilth. They do not tarry there to enjoy the "filth" of 
moral impurity, obscenity or foul language, nor do they intentionally go 
anywhere to hear or see or take part in any sort of "filth". For further 
details, see E.N. 4of Al-Muminun.<br><br>91The true servants of Allah do not 
behave like the blind and the deaf towards the Revelations of Allah, when they 
are recited to them for their admonition. They do not turn a deaf ear to their 
teachings and Message and do not deliberately close their eyes to the Signs that 
they are asked to observe, but are deeply moved by them. They follow and 
practice what they are enjoined and retrain from what is forbidden.<br><br>92The 
most distinctive characteristic of the true servants is their eagerness for 
prayer to Allah. In verse 65 their "prayer" for their own salvation and in verse 
74 their prayer for their wives and children have been cited: "Our Lord, make 
our wives and children true believers so that they should practice righteousness 
and become a source of comfort for us." Their prayer shows that the true 
servants of Allah are more concerned about the salvation of their beloved ones 
in the Hereafter than the enjoyment of the world.<br><br>It should be noted that 
this characteristic has been cited here to show that the true servants had 
sincerely believed in the Message. That is why they were so concerned about the 
"Faith" of their beloved ones. It should also be kept in mind that many of the 
near and dear ones of the Believers had not as yet embraced Islam. If a husband 
had embraced Islam, the wife was still an unbeliever, and if a youth had 
accepted Islam, his parents and brothers and sisters were still involved in 
disbelief, and vice versa. Therefore, the true servants wept and prayed for 
them, whenever the picture of their horrible state in Hell came before their 
mind's eyes. <br><br>93That is,"We should excel in piety, righteousness and good 
works; nay, we should become the leaders of the pious people so that we may lead 
them in the propagation of virtue and piety in the world. " Incidentally, this 
characteristic of the true servants was in great contrast to that of the 
disbelievers, who strove in competition and rivalry with one another for 
superiority in worldly power and wealth. But it is a pity that some people in 
our time have misinterpreted this verse as containing sanction for seeking 
candidature for political leadership. According to them, the verse means: "Our 
Lord, make us rulers over the pious people."<br><br>94The word sabr (fortitude) 
has been used here in its most comprehensive sense. The true servants 
courageously endured their persecution by the enemies of the Truth; they 
remained firm and steadfast in their struggle to establish Allah's way in the 
land; they carried out their duties enjoined by Allah sincerely and tearlessly 
without any concern for the worldly losses and deprivation; and they withstood 
all temptations held out by Satan and all the lusts of the flesh.<br><br>
95"Ghurfah " is a high mansion and the word is generally used for the "upper 
chamber" of a double-storeyed house. But the reality is that the highest 
buildings made by man in this world, even the Taj Mahal of India and the 
skyscrapers of New York, are an ugly imitation of the "excellent abodes" in 
Paradise. They are so magnificent, grand and beautiful that human imagination 
cannot form any picture of their grandeur.<br><br>96This warning to the 
disbelievers has been given in order to contrast it with the great rewards that 
have been promised to the true servants of Allah, as if to say, "If you do not 
invoke Allah for help and protection, and do not worship Him, you will have no 
value and importance in His sight, and He will not care at all for you because 
He does not stand in need of any help from you. It is indeed for your own sake 
that He has given you the opportunity to invoke Him so that He they turn in 
mercy towards you; otherwise there is no difference between you and the rest of 
creation."</p>
