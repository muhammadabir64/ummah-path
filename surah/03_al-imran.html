Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts Met,-it was Satan who caused them to fail, because of some (evil) they had done. But Allah Has blotted out (their fault): For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain." This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death, and Allah sees well all that ye do.</li><li class="collection-item"> And if ye are slain, or die, in the way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all they could amass.</li><li class="collection-item"> And if ye die, or are slain, Lo! it is unto Allah that ye are brought together.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is part of the Mercy of Allah that thou dost deal gently with them Wert thou severe or harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (Their faults), and ask for (Allah´s) forgiveness for them; and consult them in affairs (of moment). Then, when thou hast Taken a decision put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him).</li><li class="collection-item"> If Allah helps you, none can overcome you: If He forsakes you, who is there, after that, that can help you? in Allah, then, Let believers put their trust.</li><li class="collection-item"> No prophet could (ever) be false to his trust. If any person is so false, He shall, on the Day of Judgment, restore what he misappropriated; then shall every soul receive its due,- whatever it earned,- and none shall be dealt with unjustly.</li><li class="collection-item"> Is the man who follows the good pleasure of Allah Like the man who draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and whose abode is in Hell?- A woeful refuge!</li><li class="collection-item"> They are in varying gardens in the sight of Allah, and Allah sees well all that they do.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah did confer a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a messenger from among themselves, rehearsing unto them the Signs of Allah, sanctifying them, and instructing them in Scripture and Wisdom, while, before that, they had been in manifest error.</li><li class="collection-item"> What! When a single disaster smites you, although ye smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, do ye say?- "Whence is this?" Say (to them): "It is from yourselves: For Allah hath power over all things."</li><li class="collection-item"> What ye suffered on the day the two armies Met, was with the leave of Allah, in order that He might test the believers,-</li><li class="collection-item"> And the Hypocrites also. These were told: "Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (The foe from your city)." They said: "Had we known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal.</li><li class="collection-item"> (They are) the ones that say, (of their brethren slain), while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth."</li><li class="collection-item"> Think not of those who are slain in Allah´s way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord;</li><li class="collection-item"> They rejoice in the bounty provided by Allah: And with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their bliss), the (Martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) grieve.</li><li class="collection-item"> They glory in the Grace and the bounty from Allah, and in the fact that Allah suffereth not the reward of the Faithful to be lost (in the least).</li><li class="collection-item"> Of those who answered the call of Allah and the Messenger, even after being wounded, those who do right and refrain from wrong have a great reward;-</li><li class="collection-item"> Men said to them: "A great army is gathering against you": And frightened them: But it (only) increased their Faith: They said: "For us Allah sufficeth, and He is the best disposer of affairs."</li><li class="collection-item"> And they returned with Grace and bounty from Allah: no harm ever touched them: For they followed the good pleasure of Allah: And Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is only the Evil One that suggests to you the fear of his votaries: Be ye not afraid of them, but fear Me, if ye have Faith.</li><li class="collection-item"> Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief: Not the least harm will they do to Allah: Allah´s plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter, but a severe punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who purchase Unbelief at the price of faith,- not the least harm will they do to Allah, but they will have a grievous punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> Let not the Unbelievers think that our respite to them is good for themselves: We grant them respite that they may grow in their iniquity: But they will have a shameful punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now, until He separates what is evil from what is good nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the Unseen. But He chooses of His Messengers (For the purpose) whom He pleases. So believe in Allah. And His messengers: And if ye believe and do right, ye have a reward without measure.</li><li class="collection-item"> And let not those who covetously withhold of the gifts which Allah Hath given them of His Grace, think that it is good for them: Nay, it will be the worse for them: soon shall the things which they covetously withheld be tied to their necks Like a twisted collar, on the Day of Judgment. To Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah hath heard the taunt of those who say: "Truly, Allah is indigent and we are rich!"- We shall certainly record their word and (their act) of slaying the prophets in defiance of right, and We shall say: "Taste ye the penalty of the Scorching Fire!</li><li class="collection-item"> "This is because of the (unrighteous deeds) which your hands sent on before ye: For Allah never harms those who serve Him."</li><li class="collection-item"> They (also) said: "Allah took our promise not to believe in an messenger unless He showed us a sacrifice consumed by Fire (From heaven)." Say: "There came to you messengers before me, with clear Signs and even with what ye ask for: why then did ye slay them, if ye speak the truth?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Then if they reject thee, so were rejected messengers before thee, who came with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment.</li><li class="collection-item"> Every soul shall have a taste of death: And only on the Day of Judgment shall you be paid your full recompense. Only he who is saved far from the Fire and admitted to the Garden will have attained the object (of Life): For the life of this world is but goods and chattels of deception.</li><li class="collection-item"> Ye shall certainly be tried and tested in your possessions and in your personal selves; and ye shall certainly Hear much that will grieve you, from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many gods. But if ye persevere patiently, and guard against evil,-then that will be a determining factor in all affairs.</li><li class="collection-item"> And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made!</li><li class="collection-item"> Think not that those who exult in what they have brought about, and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think escape the penalty.

                      <p class="grey-text darken-3">This Surah takes its name from v. 33. Al-i-Imran, like the names of many other surahs, is merely a name to distinguish it from other surahs and does not imply that the family of Imran has been discussed in it.
</p>
<p><br><strong>The Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>This Surah consists of 
four discourses The first discourses :-<br><br>The first discourse (vv. 1-32) 
was probably revealed soon after the Battle of Badr.<br><br>The second discourse 
(vv. 33-63) was revealed in 9 A. H. on the occasion of the visit of the 
deputation from the Christians of Najran.<br><br>The third discourse (vv. 
64-120) appears to have been revealed immediately after the first one.<br><br>
The fourth discourse (vv. 121-200) was revealed after the Battle of Uhd.<br>
Subject<br><br>Though these discourses were revealed at different periods and on 
different occasions, they are so inter-linked and so inter-connected iii regard 
to their aim, object and central theme that they make together one continuous 
whole. This Surah has been especially addressed to two groups-the people of the 
Book (the Jews and the Christians) and the followers of Muhammad (Allah's peace 
be upon him).<br><br>The message has been extended to the Jews and the 
Christians in continuation of the invitation in Al-Baqarah, in which they have 
been admonished for their erroneous beliefs and evil morals and advised to 
accept, as a remedy, the Truth of the Quran. They have been told here that 
Muhammad (Allah's peace be, upon him) taught the same right way of life that had 
been preached by their own Prophets; that it alone was the Right Way, the way of 
Allah; hence any deviation from it will be wrong even according to their own 
Scriptures.<br><br>The second group, the Muslims, who had been declared to be 
the best Community in Al-Baqarah and appointed torch-bearers of the Truth and 
entrusted with the responsibility of reforming the world, have been given 
additional instructions in continuation of those given in the preceding Surah. 
The Muslims have been warned to learn a lesson from the religious and moral 
degeneration of the former communities and to refrain from treading in their 
footsteps. Instructions have also been given about the reformative work they had 
to perform. Besides this, they have been taught how to deal with the people of 
the Book and the hypocrites who were putting different kinds of hindrances in 
the way of Allah. Above all, they have been warned to guard against those 
weaknesses which had come to the surface in the Battle Uhd.<br>Background<br>
<br><strong>The following is the background of the Surah:</strong><br><br>The 
Believers had met with all sorts of trials and hardships about which they had 
been forewarned in Al-Baqarah. Though they had come out victorious in the Battle 
of Badr, they were not out of danger yet. Their victory had aroused the enmity 
of all those powers in Arabia which were opposed to the Islamic Movement. Signs 
of threatening storms had begun to appear on all sides and the Muslims were in a 
perpetual state of fear and anxiety. It looked as if the whole Arabian world 
around the tiny state of Al-Madinah - which was no more than a village state at 
that time -- was bent upon blotting out its very existence. This state of war 
was also adversely affecting its economy, which had already been badly disturbed 
by the influx of the Muslim refugees from Makkah.<br><br>Then there was the 
disturbing problem of the Jewish clans who lived in the suburbs of Al-Madinah. 
They were discarding the treaties of alliance they had made with the Holy 
Prophet after his migration from Makkah. So much so that on the occasion of the 
Battle of Badr, these people of the Book sympathized with the evil aims of the 
idolaters, in spite of the fact that their fundamental articles of the Faith - 
Oneness of Allah, Prophethood, Life-after- death -- were the same as those of 
the Muslims. After the Battle of Badr, they openly began to incite the Quraish 
and other Arab clans to wreak their vengeance on the Muslims. Thus those Jewish 
clans set aside their centuries-old friendly and neighborly relations with the 
people of Al-Madinah. At last when their mischievous actions and breaches of 
treaties became unbearable, the Holy Prophet attacked the Bani- Qainu-qa'a, the 
most mischievous of all the other Jewish clans who had conspired with the 
hypocrites of Al-Madinah and the idolatrous Arab clans to encircle the Believers 
on all sides. The magnitude of the peril might be judged from the fact that even 
the life of the Holy Prophet himself was always in danger. Therefore his 
Companions slept in their armors during that period and kept watch at night to 
guard against any sudden attack, and whenever the Holy Prophet happened to be 
out of sight even for a short while, they would at once set out in search of 
him.<br><br>This incitement by the Jews added fuel to the fire which was burning 
in the hearts of the Quraish and they began to make preparations to avenge the 
defeat they had suffered at Bad. A year after this an army of 3,000 strong 
marched out of Makkah to invade Al-Madinah and a battle took place at the foot 
of Mount Uhd. The Holy Prophet came out of Al-Madinah with one thousand men to 
meet the enemy. While they were marching to the battle-field, three hundred 
hypocrites deserted the army and returned to Al- Madinah, but there still 
remained a small band of hypocrites among the seven hundred who accompanied the 
Holy Prophet. They played their part and did their worst to create mischief and 
chaos in the ranks of the Believers during the Battle. This was the first clear 
indication of the fact that within the fold of the Muslim Community there was 
quite a large number of saboteurs who were always ready to conspire with the 
external enemies to harm their own brethren.<br><br>Though the devices of the 
hypocrites had played a great part in the set-back at Uhd, the weaknesses of the 
Muslims themselves contributed no less to it. And it was but natural that the 
Muslims should show signs of moral weakness for they were a new community which 
had only recently been formed on a new ideology and had not as yet got a 
thorough moral training. Naturally in this second hard test of their physical 
and moral strength, some weaknesses came to the surface. That is why a detailed 
review of the Battle of Uhd was needed to warn the Muslims of their shortcomings 
and to issue instructions for their reform. It should also be noted that this 
review of the Battle is quite different from the reviews that are usually made 
by generals on similar occasions.<br><br><strong>Subject: Guidance</strong><br>
<br>This Surah is the sequel to, Al-Baqarah and the invitation therein is 
continued to the people of the Book. In Al-Baqarah the Jews were pointedly 
invited to accept the Guidance and in this Surah the Christians have 
particularly been admonished to give up their erroneous beliefs and accept the 
Guidance of the Quran. At the same time, the Muslims have been instructed to 
nourish the virtues that may enable them to carry out their obligations and 
spread the Divine Guidance.<br>Topics and their Interconnection<br><br>In these 
introductory verses, the fundamental truths about Allah, Revelation and 
Life-after-death have been reiterated to serve as fitting preliminaries, leading 
to the main topics discussed in the Surah. 1 - 32<br><br>This discourse is 
particularly addressed to the Christians and invites them to accept Islam. It 
clears Jesus and his mother not only from the stigma maliciously set upon them 
by the Jews, but also refutes the erroneous Christian creed of the Divinity of 
Jesus which had been formulated because of his miraculous birth. For this 
purpose the instances of John the Baptist to a barren woman and an extremely 
aged man and that of Adam without father and mother have been cited to show that 
there is nothing in the birth of Jesus without a father to entitle him to 
Divinity. 33 - 65<br><br>In these verses the people of the Book, the Jews, have 
been invited to give up their sinister ways and accept the divine Guidance. At 
the same time the Muslims have been warned to be on their guard against their 
malicious intentions, erroneous ways and absurd objections. 66 - 101<br><br>The 
Muslims have been instructed to learn lessons from the history of the people of 
the Book and also to guard themselves against their machinations, and to prepare 
and train themselves to establish virtue and eradicate evil. 102 - 120<br><br>In 
this portion, a review of the Battle of Uhd has been mad to teach and reassure 
the Muslims that the machinations of their enemies could do them no harm, if 
they would practice restraint and fortitude and have fear of Allah. It has been 
pointed out that the set-back they had suffered was due to the lack of some 
moral qualities and the existence of some evils. Since the main cause of the 
defeat was the greed of the archers, guarding the pass, the taking of interest 
has been prohibited to eradicate this evil. 121 - 175<br><br>The main theme of 
the verses 109 - 120 has been resumed to reassure and encourage the Muslims 
against the dangerous plots of their enemies. 175 - 189<br><br>This is the 
conclusion of the Surah and is not directly connected with the verses 
immediately preceding it but with the theme of the Surah as a whole. 190 - 200<br></p>
<hr>
<p>1Please see E.N. 278, Al-Baqarah. <br><br>2There exists a common 
misconception about the Torah (Taurat) and the Gospel (Injil) for the people 
generally take the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament) for 
the Torah, and the Gospels (the first four books of the New Testament) for the 
Injil. The misconception creates doubts about Revelation itself and a question 
arises, "Are these books really the Word of God? And does the Holy Qur'an really 
confirm all their contents"? As a matter of fact, the Torah, which the Qur'an 
confirms, is not the Pentateuch but is contained in it, and the Injil is not 
"the four Gospels" but is widen these books.<br><br>The Taurat consists of those 
commandments and injunctions which were given to Prophet Moses (Allah's peace be 
upon him) during his Prophethood, which lasted for about forty years. Of these 
were the Ten commandments which were inscribed on stone tablets and delivered to 
Moses on Mount Tur: as regards the remaining Commandments and injunctions he 
himself had put down in writing. Then he handed one copy of the Torah to each of 
the twelve tribes of Israel for guidance. One copy was entrusted to the Levites 
for safe custody, which along with the stone tablets, was deposited in the Ark.<br>
<br>That Taurat remained quite sate and sound as an entire book up to the first 
destruction of Jerusalem. But, by and by, the Israelites grew so indifferent to 
and negligent and unmindful of it that when the Temple of Solomon was under 
repair during the reign of Joshiah, Hilkiah. the high Priest came across it by 
chance but did not know that it was the Torah; he thought it was only a Law book 
and passed it on to the Royal Scribe as a curio. The latter presented it to king 
Joshiah who tore his clothes and ordered Hilkiah and others to consult the 
Eternal about the terms of the book. (2 Kings, 22: 8-13). Such was the condition 
of the Israelites when Nebuchadnezzar sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple, 
and they lost for ever even the very few copies of the Torah which had long lain 
neglected in some forgotten niches.<br><br>The Old Testament was compiled by 
Ezra, when the Israelites returned home to Jerusalem after their captivity in 
Babylon and built the Temple anew. Ezra gathered together some prominent men of 
his community, and with their help compiled the whole history of Israel which 
now comprises the first 17 books of the Bible. Of these Exodus, Leviticus, 
Numbers and Deuteronorny tell the life history of Prophet Moses and include 
those verses of the real Taurat which became available to Ezra and his 
assistants, who incorporated them in those books at appropriate places in the 
chronological order of their revelation. Thus it is obvious that the Pentateuch 
as a whole is not the Taurat but includes it. The real Taurat comprises those 
verses which are scattered all over the life story of Prophet Moses, and it is 
not difficult even today to locate and recognize them. Such portions where the 
author says, "God said to Moses," or Moses said, The Lord your God says," the 
Taurat begins, and where the narrative of the life story is resumed, there that 
part of the Taurat ends. At those places the author of the Bible has inserted 
certain things by way of explanation or commentary, and it is here that the 
ordinary reader fails to distinguish the real Taurat from the commentary. 
However, those who have an insight into the nature of Divine Scriptures, can 
distinguish, to some degree of exactness, the explanatory. notes from the 
revealed verses.<br><br>According to the Qur'an, only such scattered portions in 
the Pentateuch are the Taurat and it confirms them alone. And this can be 
testified by putting together these verses and comparing them with the Qur'an. 
Here and there one might come across a minor difference in their details, but 
one cannot find even the slightest difference between the fundamental teachings 
of the two. Even today one can see clearly that both the Scriptures have come 
from the same source.<br><br>Likewise, the Injil is the name of those inspired 
discourses and sayings which Jesus (Allah's peace be upon him) uttered as a 
prophet during the last couple of years of his life. We have no means now of 
ascertaining whether these pious utterances were recorded and compiled during 
the lifetime of Jesus. In the introduction to his translation of the Bible, 
Moffat says, "Jesus wrote nothing and for a time his immediate disciples felt no 
impulse to write any account of him. The data of the historical Jesus, therefore 
is based on the vivid recollections and traditions of the primitive Palestinian 
disciples. How soon their materials took written shape we cannot tell, but at 
least one written record of them was probably in existence by about A.D.50." 
Anyhow, when, long after his recall, the stories of Jesus were compiled in the 
shape of tour Gospels, (the period of the composition of Mark, the tirst to be 
composed was 65-75 A.D.), some of his written or inspired sayings were also 
inserted at appropriate places in the historical sketches. Thus it is obvious 
that the first tour Gospels are not the Injil, the discourses and sayings of 
Jesus, but they contain it. We have no means of recognizing thetas from the 
works of the authors except this: Wherever the authors say "Jesus said so or 
taught so and so," there the Injil begins and where they resume the narration, 
there it ends. According to the Qur'an, only such portions are the Injil and 
these alone are condensed by it. If these portions are compiled together and 
compared with the Qur'an, one will tied no serious difference between the two, 
and, if somewhere a trivial difference appears, it can be removed very easily 
with unbiased thinking.<br><br>3That is, "He has full, perfect and exact 
knowledge of the whole universe. Hence the Book revealed by Him will contain 
nothing but the Truth. As a matter of fact, one can learn pure Truth from that 
Book alone which has been sent down by the All-Knowing and All-Wise."<br><br>
4This implies two important things here:<br><br>(1) Allah knows your nature 
better than yourself or anybody else: therefore, there is no other alternative 
for you but to trust in the Guidance sent down by Him.<br><br>(2) The Benevolent 
Allah Who has been providing for all your needs, great and small, throughout all 
the stages of your life, ever since your mothers conceived you, could not 
possibly have neglected to provide for your guidance, which is after all the 
greatest need of your life. <br><br>5"Muhkam" is that which is precise, exact, 
clear and decisive. Muhkamat are those verses of the Qur'an which have been so 
couched as to make their meaning quite plain without any shade of ambiguity. 
They have been purposely so worded as to make their meaning definite and precise 
leaving little room for misinterpretation. These verses constitute the 
fundamental principles of the Book, i. e.. they and they alone determine the aim 
and object for which the Qur'an has been sent down. They invite the world to 
Islam, teach morals and give warnings. They refute wrong beliefs and practices, 
and lay down the way of right living. They expound the fundamentals of religion 
and state beliefs and practices, morals and duties, commandments and 
prohibitions. Therefore a seeker after Truth should turn to these verses as 
these alone can satisfy his needs. Naturally such a person will concentrate on 
these verses and endeavour to derive the greatest benefit from them. <br><br>
6Mutashabihat are those verses in which there is a possibility of more than one 
meaning. Their object is to give a certain minimum knowledge about the universe, 
its beginning and end, the position of man therein, and such other basic things, 
for these things are essential for the formulation of any system of life. It is 
obvious that no human language possesses words, expressions, idioms etc., to 
depict clearly those supernatural things, which have never yet been grasped by 
human senses, nor seen nor heard nor smelt nor touched nor tasted by human 
beings. That is why such supernatural things have to be described in terms of 
human life. That is why the Qur'an uses ambiguous verses in human language which 
are liable to give rise to more than one meaning. Thus it is clear that the main 
benefit of such verses is that they help one approach the Reality and form a 
conception of it. Hence the more one tries to determine their precise meanings, 
the more one gets involved in doubts and ambiguities. As a result of this, one 
will not be able to find the Reality but will be led further away from it and 
cause mischief. Therefore those, who seek after the Truth and do not hanker 
after superfluities, rest content with the simple idea of Reality they get from 
the ambiguous verses, which suffices thetas for an understanding of the Qur'an; 
they concentrate their whole attention on a fuller comprehension of the verses 
which are precise in meaning. On the other hand, those who love superfluities or 
seek after mischief, spend their tune and energies in giving arbitrary 
interpretations to the ambiguous verses. <br><br>7This might give rise to a 
question: how can one believe in the truth of the ambiguous verses, if one does 
not know their precise meaning? The answer is that a study of the precise 
verses, and not of the different interpretations of the ambiguous verses, 
confirms a sensible man in his belief that the Qur'an is the Word of Allah. When 
the study of the precise verses once convinces him that the Book is really from 
Allah, then the ambiguous verses do not create any doubt in his mind and he 
accepts the simple meanings which are within his comprehension and leaves alone 
any complicacies if and when they appear. Instead of hair splitting and probing 
into them, he believes in the Word of Allah as a whole and turns his attention 
to more useful things.<br><br>8Please see E.N. 161, AI-Baqarah. <br><br>
9Although the actual ratio was three to one, yet even a casual observer could 
not have failed to notice that the number of the unbelievers was at least twice 
as great as that of the Muslims. <br><br>10A brief review of the Battle of Badr, 
which had recently taken place, is being made with a view to imparting lessons 
by snaking a reference to its events and its results. This Battle taught three 
important lessons:<br><br>It taught that even on the battlefield the Believers, 
who tight in the way of Allah, behave in quite a different manner from the 
disbelievers. The latter, like the Quraish, indulge in merry making and enjoying 
wine, women, music, dance etc., while the former, like the Muslims, practise 
piety, and fear Allah and absorb themselves in prayer.<br><br>(2) The victory of 
the Muslims, in spite of their smaller number and less equipment, over the 
disbelievers who had a larger number and better weapons was a clear proof that 
they had Allah's succour with them.<br><br>(3) The defeat was a shocking lesson 
for the disbelievers, who were neglectful of Allah's power and proud of their 
equipment and the large number of their helpers. By this, Allah taught that He 
can bestow power on a small number of poor migrants from Makkah arid the farmers 
of Al-Madinah, to inflict crushing defeat on the Quraish, the most influential 
and powerful clan of Arabia.<br><br>11Please see E.N. 27, Al-Baqarah. <br><br>
12That is, "Allah dces not shower His favours erroneously nor whimsically nor 
dces He make cursory and superficial decisions. He is fully aware of the 
actions, deeds and intentions of His servants, and evaluates them correctly and 
knows full well who should deserve His favour and who should incur His 
displeasure." <br><br>13It means, "They stand steadfast for the sake of truth, 
are not daunted by losses or hardships, are not disheartened by failures, and 
are not turned aside from the right path by temptations. They stick to the Truth 
even when there appears to be no chance of success." (Please see E.N. 60, 
Al-Baqarah also.) <br><br>14That is: This' is the testimony of Allah Himself 
that He alone in the whole universe possesses the attributes of God-head and the 
authority and the rights of God-head. This is His testimony, and who could be a 
more reliable Testifier than He Who has direct knowledge of all the realities of 
the universe? He sees His whole c: eation spread before Him, and from Him 
nothing is hidden in the heavens or in the earth.<br><br>15Next to Allah, the 
most trustworthy witnesses are angels, who are the managing agents of the 
affairs of His Kingdom of the Universe. Their evidence is based on their 
personal knowledge, that is,<br><br>"None but Allah wields command in this 
kingdom and none but He gives orders for the administration of the affairs of 
the earth and the heavens." Then all those people, who have been bestowed with 
the knowledge of the realities, have been unanimously bearing witness, since the 
beginning of the world to the present day. that Allah alone is the Master and 
the Designer of the whole universe.<br><br>16It implies that in the sight of 
Allah there is only one correct system and one right way of life for man. It is 
this: Man should worship Allah, acknowledge Him as his Master and surrender 
himself completely to Him in His worship and service. He should not invent his 
own way of worship but should faithfully follow that Guidance alone which Allah 
has revealed through His Messengers, without adding anything to or taking away 
anything from it. This way of thinking and behaving is called "Islam." And it is 
the absolute right of the Creator and the Master of the Universe that He should 
not accept as lawful from His subjects, His own creation, any way other than 
Islam. One might ignorantly think it to be one's right to follow any system, 
atheism, idolatry, etc., but the Ruler of the Universe will regard this 
behaviour as rebellious. <br><br>17It means that originally Islam and Islam 
alone was professed and preached by every Messenger who was sent by Allah at any 
time in any comer of the world. Hence any Scripture sent down to any community 
in any language taught the same Islam. Afterwards, the people distorted this 
original religion and added to it something to suit their interests or to 
gratify their lusts, and omitted those things from it which went against their 
interests. They invented new religions just because they wanted to transgress 
the prescribed limits and run after undue privileges and gains and distinctions. 
Thus they made changes in the beliefs, principles and injunctions of the true 
Faith to make it subservient to their own desires and lusts. <br><br>18The same 
thing may be expressed thus: "My followers and I have been convinced of this 
same pure Islam and have accepted the true religion of Allah; now tell us 
whether you also will give up the innovations which you and your elders have 
introduced into it and turn to the original true religion." <br><br>19This is an 
ironical way of bringing home to the disbelievers the consequences of those 
mischievous deeds in which they rejoice today, regarding them as "nice things."
<br><br>20That is, "As they have spent all their energies and powers in evil 
ways, their works will bring them to ruin both in this world and in the Next 
World"<br><br>21That is, "There is no such power which can bring out good 
results from their wrongly directed efforts or at least make them harmless. All 
the various agencies, which they believe will help them in this world or in the 
Next World or in both, shall be absolutely of no avail to them anywhere." <br>
<br>22That is, "They are asked to acknowledge the Book of Allah as the final 
authority and bow before its decrees and accept as true whatever is proved to he 
true by it, and reject whatever is proved to be false by it. "It should be noted 
that here by the Book of God is meant the Torah or the Gospel and by "the people 
who have received a share of the knowledge of the Book" are meant the learned 
people of the Jews and the Christians. <br><br>23As such people regard 
themselves to be the favourites of God, they delude themselves that they are 
going to enter into Paradise anyhow, irrespective of the quality of their deeds. 
They foolishly believe that the fire of Hell dare not touch them because they 
are "true" believers and the children of such pious ancestors, and the followers 
of such and such prophets and the disciples of such and such saints, etc., etc. 
And if at all they are cast into Hell, they argue, they will be kept there only 
for a few days and that, too, to be cleansed of the impurity of sins and then 
will go into Paradise permanently. Such misleading ideas and conceptions have 
made them so bold that they commit the gravest crimes and the most heinous sins 
fearlessly: so much so that they openly disown the Truth without the least fear 
of Allah. <br><br>24Verses 26 and 27 fit in beautifully between the preceding 
and the subsequent verses. From verse 19 begins a warning and challenge to the 
opponents of Islam, and in verse 25, the Muslims have been consoled with the 
assurance that their enemies shall be paid in full on the Day of Judgment. But 
in order to reassure them, Allah has in these verses, answered an unasked 
question which arises when one sees that the disbelievers and the disobedient to 
Allah are prospering in the world, while the believers and the obedient servants 
of Allah are starving and suffering from hardships. The question is: What wisdom 
underlies this disparity in the prosperity and adversity of the two groups? At 
the time (A.H. 3) of the revelation of this discourse the Holy Prophet and his 
Companions were so hard pressed on all sides that the same question was arising 
in the people's minds. Its answer is contained in these verses: Allah to Whom 
belongs all authority, power, wealth, prosperity etc., etc., gives a portion of 
these to whomsoever He wills, and they should not feel uneasy and anxious about 
this disparity because He is All Wise and All-Knowing. Moreover Allah gives 
wealth to whomsoever He wills; therefore it is not to be made the criterion of 
honour and friendship. Hence in the subsequent verses, the Muslims have been 
prohibited from making the prosperous disbelievers their friends. <br><br>25That 
is, "If a believer falls into the hands of the enemies of Islam and is afraid of 
maltreatment and high-handedness, he may conceal his Faith, and live among them 
as if he were one of them. Or, if they come to know of his Faith, he may make a 
show of his friendship towards them to save his life. In case of extreme fear, 
he is permitted even to disown his Faith, if he feels that he is not strong 
enough to endure their oppression." <br><br>26This is the admonition: Let not 
the fear of the people dominate over you so much as to drive out the fear of 
Allah from your hearts. The greatest harm the people can do to you is confined 
to the worldly life only, but Allah has the power to inflict an everlasting 
torment on you. Therefore, if you are forced in a case of extremity to hide your 
Faith due to any danger to your life, you may save your own life and property, 
provided that you do not in any way harm the interests of the Islamic mission 
and the Islamic community or the life or property of any Muslim. At the same 
time you must remain on your guard against becoming the instrument in the hands 
of disbelievers so as to strengthen the evil forces against Islam and render any 
service to the disbelievers that might enable them to overpower the Muslims. 
Remember that, if to save your life you do any kind of harm to the religion of 
Allah or to the community of the faithful or even to the person of a single 
believer, or if you render any real service to the rebels against Allah, you 
will never be able to save yourselves on the Day of Reckoning, when you shall 
have at last to return to Allah<br><br>27That is, "It is simply out of His 
extreme compassion for you that Allah warns you beforehand of those things that 
might lead you to ruin." <br><br>28Here the first discourse ends. If We consider 
its theme, and especially its reference to the Battle of Badr, we come to the 
conclusion that the probable period of the revelation of this was some time 
after the Battle of Badr and before the Battle of Uhd, that is 3 A.H. A 
tradition of Muhammad bin Ishaq has generally misled people to fix the period of 
the revelation of the first 80 verses to 9 A.H., for according to that tradition 
it was sent down on the occasion of the deputation from Najran. But obviously, 
that is wrong for two reasons: first, the subject of this introductory discourse 
shows clearly that it was revealed much earlier. Second, the tradition of 
Mugatil-bin-Sulaiman is explicit on the point that on the occasion of the said 
deputation only those verses (33-63) were revealed which give an account of John 
the Baptist and Jesus (God's pe ace be upon them). <br><br>29From here begins 
the second discourse. It was sent down in 9 A.H. on the occasion of the visit of 
the deputation from the Christian State of Najran, which lay between Hijaz and 
Yemen. It is said that it comprised 73 villages and towns and was capable of 
raising an army of more than one hundred thousand strong. The population was 
wholly Christian and was governed by the "Aqib," who was the head of the 
community, and the "Sayyid," who was in charge of the social and political 
affairs and the Bishop, who looked after the religious affairs of the people. 
The above-mentioned deputation was one of the many who visited the Holy Prophet 
after the conquest of Makkah, when the whole of Arabia came to realize that the 
future. of the country was now in his hands. This deputation from Najran to 
AI-Madinah consisted of 60 men and the three heads of the government. As they 
had no mind to go to war, the question before them was either to embrace Islam 
or to live as zimmi (proteges). On this occasion Allah sent down this discourse 
to the Holy Prophet to invite the members of the deputation to Islam. <br><br>
30`Imran was the name of the father of Moses and Aaron and has been mentioned as 
"Amram" in the Bible. <br><br>31The main cause of the misguidance of the 
Christians is that they consider Jesus to be the son of God and a partner in 
God-head, instead of His Servant and Messenger. Therefore this basic error is 
being corrected with a view to making them understand the true and real Islam. 
That is why the introduction to the discourse begins with the assertion that 
Adam and Noah and the Prophets from the family of Abraham and from the family of 
`Imran, were all human beings and none of them was "God. " Their only 
distinction was that Allah had chosen them for the preaching of His religion and 
reforming the World.<br><br>32If by the "woman of `Imran" is meant the "wife of 
`Imran", then this must be a different 'Imran from the one mentioned above in v. 
33. In that case one comes to the conclusion that the father of Mary was named 
'Imran after that ancestor. But if by the "woman of `Imran" is meant a woman 
from the family of 'Imran, then it merely shows that Mary's mother was a 
descendant of `Imran. We possess no authentic knowledge of the basis on which 
one opinion may be preferred to the other. Though according to some Christian 
traditions the name of Mary's father was Iaachim, history does not say who the 
father of Mary was and to which family her mother belonged. But if the tradition 
that the mothers of Mary and Elisabeth, the mother of John, were cousins be 
taken as we, (Luke 1: 36), then the "woman of `Imran" will mean a woman from the 
family of `Imran. The Gospel of Luke (1:5) says that Elisabeth, the wife of 
Zacharias. "was of the daughters of Aaron", that is, 'Imran daughter or woman of 
`Imran; therefore it is clear that there is no anachronism of confounding 
Miriam, the sister of Aaron, with the virgin Mary. It is a common practice to 
call children by the names of their ancestors; so both the explanations are 
equally acceptable. Moreover, it does not make any difference whatsoever, in the 
line of argument adopted here to explain the miraculous birth of Jesus, whether 
'Imran was really the name of Mary's father or has been called so in the 
ancestral sense.<br><br>33That is, "Thou hearest the prayers of Thy servants and 
art aware of their intentions." <br><br>34By this she meant, "Had it been a 
male, it would have been better because the female is handicapped by many 
natural frailties and social restrictions and cannot become a priest. A male 
child would, therefore, have served the purpose better for which I have 
dedicated my child in Thy way."<br><br>35This happened when Mary had reached the 
age of discretion and had been admitted into the sanctuary of the Temple 
(Jerusalem), where she was busy, day and night, in the worship of Allah. 
Zacharias who had been made her guardian was probably the husband of her 
maternal aunt and was one of the keepers of the Temple. He was not the Prophet 
Zachariah, who was killed according to the Old Testament. <br><br>36The Arabic 
word "mihrab"usually reminds one of the arch (prayer niche) meant for the imam 
in the mosques. But here this word has been used for those cells which are built 
on comparatively raised ground adjoining the monasteries and churches. They are 
meant for the keepers and guardians of the places of worship, and for those who 
retire for worship in seclusion. In such a Cell Mary had retired for worship in 
seclusion. <br><br>37Zacharias was childless till that time. Seeing this pious 
young girl, he longed for a good child. Seeing how she was growing under the 
special protection of Allah, Who supplied her in her seclusion, with provisions 
from His vast sources, he began to cherish the hope that Allah should bestow 
upon him a child even in his old age, if He so willed. <br><br>38The Bible 
mentions him as John the Baptist. (Matthew: Chaps. 3, 11,14; Mark 1, 6; Luke 1, 
3). <br><br>39"Command from Allah" here refers to Jesus Christ. The Holy Qur'an 
calls him a "Command from Allah" because the birth was brought about 
miraculously by an extraordinary Command from Allah. <br><br>40That is, "Despite 
your old age and the sterility of your wife, Allah will bestow upon you a son."
<br><br>41That is, "Give me a token to assure me beforehand of the birth of a 
son to an old man and a barren woman." <br><br>42The main object of this 
discourse is to make the Christians realize the error of their belief in taking 
Jesus for the son of God, and making him an object of worship. The extraordinary 
birth of John has been mentioned in the Qur'an to serve as .introduction to the 
subsequent argument against their wrong belief. The miraculous birth of Jesus 
could no more entitle him to Divinity than the extraordinary birth of John, 
brought about in the same family in a different and unusual way could entitle 
the latter to Divinity. <br><br>43As Mary was a girl who had been dedicated by 
her mother to the Temple in the way of Allah, the question of her guardianship 
had become a problem for the keepers because of her sex. They were therefore 
casting lots to decide the delicate problem. <br><br>44That is, "Although no man 
has touched you, yet a son shall be born to you." It should be noted that the 
same word "kazalika, "meaning "so shall it be," had been used in response to 
Zacharias' prayer. It, therefore, carries the same sense here. Moreover, the 
whole context here corroborates the story that Mary was given the glad tidings 
of the birth of a son without any sexual intercourse, and the birth of Christ, 
in actual fact, took place in that unusual way. If a son was to be born to her 
in the normal known way, and if the event of the birth of Jesus had taker. place 
in a natural way, then the whole discourse starting from verse 33 and ending 
with verse 63 would become absolutely pointless. Not only that but all other 
references to the unusual birth of Jesus in the Qur'an would lose their 
significance and meaning. The Christians had made Jesus the Son of God and 
worthy of worship simply because of his unusual birth without a father and the 
Jews had accused Mary because they had witnessed that she had given birth to a 
child, though she was not married. Had it been otherwise, then the two groups 
could have been told plainly that the girl was married to such and such a man 
and that Jesus was from his seed. In that case, one fails to see the reason why 
such a long introduction and a series of arguments should have been necessary to 
remove all doubts about his miraculous birth. Then Jesus could have been called 
the son of a particular man, instead of being called "the son of Mary". The 
position of those people who, on the one hand, profess to believe the Holy 
Qur'an to be the Word of Allah and on the other hand try to prove that Jesus was 
born after the natural coming together of a husband and wife, really try to show 
that Allah is not able to express Himself as clearly as these people. (May God 
protect us from blasphemy!) <br><br>45That is, "These Signs are clear enough to 
convince you that I have been sent by that Allah Who is the Creator and Absolute 
Ruler of this universe, provided that you are not obdurate but are willing to 
accept the Truth." <br><br>46That is, "This is yet another proof of the fact 
that I have been sent by Allah. If I had been a false prophet I would have 
invented my own religion and by virtue of these miracles striven to divert you 
from your previous Faith to the New creed. But I profess the same original 
religion to be true and confirm the same teachings which were brought by the 
Prophets before me."<br><br>The fact that Jesus taught the same religion that 
had been presented by Moses and the other Prophets is supported even by the 
existing Gospels. For example, according to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus 
declared in the Sermon on the Mount: "Think not that I am come to destroy the 
law, or the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." (5: 17).<br><br>
One of the Pharisees, who was a lawyer, asked Jesus, "Which is the great 
commandment in the law?" He replied:<br><br>"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God 
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the 
first and the great commandment. And the second is like. unto it, Thou shalt 
love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and 
Prophets." (Matthew 22: 37-40). On another occasion Jesus said to his disciples:<br>
<br>"The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: All therefore whatsoever 
they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for 
they say, and do not." (Matthew 23: 2-3). <br><br>47That is, "I have come to 
efface and abolish the superstitions of your ignorant people, the hairsplitting 
of your jurists, the religious austerities of your ascetics and the restrictive 
additions made in the Law of Allah under the non-Muslim domination; I will make 
lawful or unlawful for you only those things which Allah has made lawful or 
unlawful." <br><br>48This shows that like all other Prophets, Jesus also based 
his teachings on the following three fundamentals:<br><br>(1) The Supreme 
Authority to which mankind should submit and surrender exclusively belongs to 
Allah and all the social and moral systems should be built entirely on it.<br>
<br>(2) Being a representative of the same Pararmount Power, a prophet must be 
obeyed unconditionally.<br><br>(3) Allah alone is entitled to prescribe laws and 
regulations for making things lawful or unlawful, pure and impure; consequently 
all laws imposed by others must be abolished.<br><br>Thus it is clear that 
Jesus, Moses, Muhammad and all other Prophets (Allah's peace be upon them all) 
had one and the same mission. Those people who aver that different Prophets were 
sent with different missions and to fulfil different aims, are gravely mistaken. 
Anyone, who is delegated by the Absolute Master of the Universe to His subjects, 
cannot have any other mission than to prevent the people, from becoming 
disobedient to and independent of Him, and to forbid them to set others to rank 
with Allah as partners in His Authority in any way. For, they are sent to invite 
the people to surrender and submit and be loyal to the Almighty God and worship 
Him alone.<br><br>It is a pity that the existing Gospels do not present the 
mission of Jesus so precisely and clearly as it has been presented above in the 
Holy Qur'an. Nevertheless all the three basic things mentioned above are found 
scattered over in these Books. For instance, the fact that Jesus believed 
exclusively in the worship of Allah is clear from the following:<br><br>(1) 
"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve." (Matthew 
4: 10).<br><br>(2) Not only did he believe in this, but also made it the 
ultimate aim of all his activities and strove to make the people of the earth to 
submit to the revealed Law of Allah just as the whole universe submits to His 
physical Law.<br><br>"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in 
heaven." (Matthew 6 :10).<br><br>Then the fact that Jesus always presented 
himself as a prophet and as a representative of the Kingdom of Heaven, and 
always invited the people to follow him in that capacity alone, is supported by 
a number of his sayings. When he started his mission in his native place, 
Nazareth, the people of his own town and his own kinsfolk rose against him and 
according to an agreed tradition of Matthew, Mark and Luke, he said: "No prophet 
is accepted in his own country". And when his enemies were conspiring at 
Jerusalem to kill him and the people advised him to go to somewhere else, he 
replied: "It cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem." (Luke 13: 33).<br>
<br>When he was entering Jerusalem for the last time, his disciples began to 
utter in a loud voice: "Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the 
Lord." At this the Pharisees felt offended and asked him to silence his 
disciples. He replied:<br><br>"I tell you that, if these should hold their 
peace, the stones would inunediately cry out." (Luke 19: 38-40).<br><br>On 
another occasion he said: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, 
and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek 
and lowly in heart ..... my yoke is easy, and my burden is light." (Matthew 11: 
28-30). Moreover the fact that Jesus wanted the people to obey the Divine Law 
rather than man-made laws becomes clear from that tradition of Matthew and Mark 
which says that when the Pharisees asked, why his disciples transgressed the 
tradition of the elders and took food without washing their hands,. he replied 
and said, "Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written. This 
people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Howbeit in 
vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. For 
laying aside the commandments of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the 
washing of pots and cups, and many other such like things ye do. And he said 
unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own 
tradition. For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth 
father or mother, iet him die the death: But ye say, If a man shall say to his 
father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou 
mightest he profited by me; he shall be free. And ye suffer him no more to do 
ought for his father or his mother; Making the word of God of none effect 
through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do 
ye." (Mark 7: 6-13).<br><br>49The Arabic word (havari) is almost the equivalent 
of "helper". In the Bible, they have been called "disciples" and at some places 
"apostles" because Jesus used to send them tc the people to deliver his message, 
and not because God had appointed them as His apostles. <br><br>50Those people 
who help establish Islam have been called Allah's helpers. In order to 
understand its significance, it should be kept in view that Allah has taken upon 
Himself to persuade human beings to adopt Islam of their free will, for He does 
not force His will on man in those spheres of his life in which He has granted 
him freedom of action but likes to convince him by reason and admonition. As it 
is the work of Allah to bring the people to the right way by admonition and 
advice, He calls those people who exert their utmost to establish Islam "His 
helpers and companions:" This is indeed the highest position that a servant of 
Allah can aspire to achieve. For man's position is merely that of a servant when 
he is engaged in praying, fasting and other kinds of worship, but he is elevated 
to the high and unique position of God's companion and assistant when he is 
exerting for the establishment of the way of Allah. And this is indeed the 
loftiest position of spiritual attainment, to which a man can aspire in this 
world. <br><br>51The word (mutawaffi) in the Arabic text is from (tawaffa) which 
literally means "to take and to receive" and "to seize the soul" is not its 
lexical but metaphorical meaning. Here it means "to recall from mission." Allah 
recalled Jesus because the Israelites had rejected him in spite of the clear 
Signs he had brought. They had been disobeying God for centuries and, in spite 
of many a warning and admonition served to them, their national character was 
rapidly deteriorating. They had killed several Prophets, one after the other, 
and had grown so audacious as to demand the blood of any good man who ventured 
to invite them to the Right Way. In order to give them the last chance for 
turning to the Truth, God appointed among them two great Prophets, Jesus and 
John (God's peace be upon them), at one and the same time. These Prophets came 
with such clear signs of their appointment from Allah that only such people 
dared reject them as were utterly perverted and prejudiced against the Truth and 
were averse to following the Right Way. Nevertheless the Israelites lost their 
last chance also as they not only rejected their invitation but also had the 
head of a great Prophet like John cut off openly at the request of a dancing 
girl. 'And their Pharisees and Jurists conspired and sought to get Jesus 
punished with the death sentence by the Roman Government. Thus they had proved 
themselves to be so obdurate that it was useless to give the Israelites any 
further chance. So Allah recalled His Prophet Jesus and inflicted on them a life 
of disgrace up to the Day of Resurrection.<br><br>It will be useful here to bear 
in mind the fact that this whole discourse is meant to refute and correct the 
Christian belief in the God-head of Jesus. Three main things were responsible 
for the prevalence of this belief among the Christians:<br><br>(1) The 
miraculous birth of Jesus.<br><br>(2) His concrete and tangible miracles.<br>
<br>(3) His ascension to heaven about which their Scriptures were explicit.<br>
<br>The Qur'an confirmed the first thing and made it plain that the birth of 
Jesus without a father was only a manifestation of the infinite powers of Allah. 
He can create anybody in whatever manner He wills. His miraculous birth, 
therefore, is no reason why he should be made a god or a partner in Godhead.<br>
<br>The Qur'an also confirms the second thing and even recounts the miracles 
performed by Jesus, but makes it clear that all those miracles were performed by 
him, as a servant of Allah, by His leave and not as an independent authority. It 
is, therefore, wrong to infer that Jesus was a partner in Godhead.<br><br>Now 
let us consider the third thing. If the Christian belief in "Ascension" had been 
wholly baseless, it could have been refuted by pointing out that the object of 
their worship, the so-called "Son of God", expired long ago and had become one 
with dust, and that they could see, for their full satisfaction, his grave at 
such and such a place. But the Qur'an does not declare this explicitly. On the 
other hand, it not only uses such words as give at least a vague suggestion of 
his "Ascension", but also denies that Jesus was crucified at all. According to 
it the one who gave a loud cry at his last hour, saying, "Eli" Eli, lama 
sabachthani?" and the one whose picture they carry on the cross, was not Messiah 
at all, because God had recalled to Himself the real Messiah before the 
crucifixion took place.<br><br>It is thus clear that those people who try to 
prove the death of Jesus from these verses, really try to show that God is not 
able to express Himself clearly and unambiguously. (May God protect us from such 
a blasphemy!) <br><br>52"Those who rejected" him were the Jews who were invited 
by Jesus to accept the Truth.<br><br>"Those who follow" him are really the 
Muslims only but if it may be taken to imply all those who believe in him, then 
the sincere Christians may also be included.<br><br>53That is, "If one's 
miraculous birth entitles one to become God or the Son of God, then Adam was 
better entitled to it because he was created without either a human father or a 
mother, while Jesus was born without a father only. <br><br>54The main points in 
the discourse presented before the Christians up to here are: First, they have 
been admonished to realize that their belief in the Godhead of Jesus is gravely 
ill-founded. He was only a man who was born in a miraculous way by the will of 
Allah and given the power to perform certain miracles as a clear proof of his 
Prophethood. As regards his "Ascension", Allah had arranged to recall him to 
Himself before the disbelievers could crucify him. In fact, the Master of the 
Universe has full powers to treat any of His servants in any special way He 
pleases. It is, therefore, wrong to infer from the exceptional treatment 
accorded to Jesus that he himself was the Master or the Master's Son or a 
partner in the authority of the Master.<br><br>Secondly, their attention has 
been drawn to the fact that Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) invites 
them to the same Truth that had been preached by Prophet Jesus (God's peace be 
upon him) in his own time and that the teachings of the two Prophets were 
basically identical.<br><br>Thirdly, the disciples of Jesus believed in and 
followed the same religion of Islam that is being presented in the Qur'an. 
However the Christians of the later age discarded the message of Jesus and 
digressed from the Faith of his disciples.<br><br>55This method of settling the 
dispute was proposed to show conclusively that the members of the deputation of 
Najran were behaving obdurately. As a matter of fact, they had no answer to the 
things pointed out in the above discourse and could not bring any authority even 
from their own Scriptures to justify and support their beliefs under discussion. 
They could not, therefore, assert with full conviction that their beliefs 
conformed to the fact and were not false. Besides this, when they observed 
closely the character and the teachings and the works of the Holy Prophet, the 
majority of the members of the deputation were so impressed that they became 
convinced in their hearts of his Prophethood; or at least, they could not reject 
it boldly. That is why they did not accept the challenge: "If you really believe 
in the truth of your creed, you should pray with us to Allah and invoke His 
curse on those who say false things about Christ." The fact that they declined 
to accept the challenge showed plainly to the whole of Arabia that the religious 
leaders and priests of the Christians of Najran who were known far and wide for 
their piety, professed beliefs about which they themselves were not sure. <br>
<br>56From here begins the third discourse. Its subject-matter clearly shows 
that it was revealed in the period intervening the battles of Badr and Uhd. The 
contents of the three discourses are so closely interlinked that there is no 
incoherence anywhere between them. That is why some commentators have been 
misled to believe that this also formed part of the discourse addressed to the 
Najran deputation. But the tone of the discourse commencing from here clearly 
shows that it was addressed to the Jews. <br><br>57That is, "Join us in the 
creed which we have accepted and which you also cannot reject as false, for it 
is confirmed and supported by the teachings of your own Scriptures <br><br>
58That is, "Your Judaism and Christianity came into existence long after the 
revelation of the Torah and the Gospel, whereas Abraham (God's peace be upon 
him) had passed away long before those Books were sent down. Now, even a man of 
ordinary common sense can easily understand that the religion of Abraham could 
in no sense be Judaism or Christianity. Thus, if Abraham was on the right way 
and had obtained salvation, as you also believe, then it becomes abundantly 
clear that one need not follow Judaism or Christianity to be on the Right Way 
and to obtain salvation." (Also see E.N. 135 and 141, Al-Baqarah.) <br><br>59The 
Arabic word (hanif) stands for a person who chooses to follow one particular way 
after rejecting all other ways. We have conveyed this meaning by "a Muslim, 
sound in the Faith."<br><br>60There may be another rendering of this sentence: 
"You yourselves testify these." But in neither case is the sense of the passage 
affected. The fact is that the pious life of the Holy Prophet and the marvelous 
effects which his precepts and example were producing on the lives of his 
Companions, and the high and sublime teachings of the Qur'an, were all such 
clear Signs of God that no one, who was familiar with the lives of the Prophets 
and with the nature of the heavenly Scriptures, could possibly doubt or deny his 
Prophethood. Thus, in fact, many a people of the Book (especially the learned 
among them) had realized that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was the same 
Prophet whose coming had been foretold by the former Prophets. So much so, that 
they were at times completely overpowered by the force of the plain Truth, and 
would unwittingly admit and confirm that the teachings of the Holy Prophet were 
true. That is why, the Qur'an accuses them time and again of obduracy and 
deliberate rejection of the Truth after seeing clear Signs of God and being 
fully convinced of it in their hearts.<br><br>61This was one of those tricks 
which the leaders and the rabbis of the Jews, living in the suburbs of 
Al-Madinah used to play in order to weaken the force of the Islamic Movement. 
They feigned an interest in Islam only to detach some of the Muslims by some 
subtle arrangements. Their object was to dishearten the Muslims and create 
doubts among the masses about teachings of the Holy Prophet. For this purpose 
they began to send people to AI-Madinah to profess Islam openly and then become 
apostates and proclaim everywhere that they had come out of Islam because they 
had witnessed such and such evils among the Muslims and their Prophet.<br><br>
61aThey were stirred to play this wicked game by their envy of Islam and bias in 
favour of the religion of their fore-fathers. They have been rebuked, as if to 
say, "God is not bound by your prejudices, but He bestows His Guidance on anyone 
He wills, and He has by His grace blessed the Muslims with the same Guidance 
that was once bestowed upon you. You must understand it well that your wily 
tricks will not succeed in snatching away that Guidance from them nor in 
changing it into misguidance but only in providing a strong argument against you 
before your Lord." By this, Allah willed to see whether they would give up their 
prejudice and accept the Guidance which had been given to another (Muhammad) or 
whether they would persist in their envy and reject it and provide the Muslims 
with a strong argument against themselves before their Lord that they rejected 
the Truth merely because of their prejudice and obduracy. <br><br>62The Arabic 
word "wase" (All-embracing) generally occurs on three occasions in the Qur'an:<br>
<br>(1)When a community of people is warned of their narrow-mindedness and told 
that Allah is not narrow-minded like them;<br><br>(2) When one is rebuked for 
miserliness and stinginess and is told that Allah is generous and not miserly 
like him:<br><br>(3) When people believe Allah to be finite because of the 
limitations of their own imagination, they are told that Allah is Infinite and 
Limitless. (Also see E.N. 116, Al-Baqarah.) <br><br>63That is, "Allah knows full 
well Who deserves honour and excellence."<br><br>64That is, "They were required 
to be fair only in their dealings with the Jews, and there was no harm in 
usurping the property of a non-Jew." This belief was not confined to the 
ignorant Jewish masses, but their whole religious system was so moulded as to 
allow differentiation between Israelites and non-Israelites in their dealings. 
Their moral code disallowed a certain treatment towards the Israelites but 
allowed the same towards a non-Israelite; one and the same thing was right for 
an Israelite but the same thing was wrong for a non-Israelite. For instance, the 
Bible says: "At the end of every seven years...every creditor that lendeth ought 
unto his neighbour shall release it...", but "Of a foreigner thou mayest exact 
it again." (Deut. 15: 1-3). At another place the law about usury has been laid 
down like this: "Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy 
brother thou shalt not lend upon usury." (Deut. 23: 20). "If a man be found 
stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise 
of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die." (Deut. 24: 7). <br><br>
65Although they were guilty of the blackest sins, yet they had taken it for 
granted that they would rise as the favourites of God on the Day of Resurrection 
and they alone would receive His blessings and favours, for they would be 
rescued from the consequences of the sins they committed in this world by the 
intercession of their saints in the Next World, but the fact is that they will 
be dealt with on that Day in quite a different manner. <br><br>66Taken 
figuratively the Arabic Text may also imply that they turn away from the right 
meaning of the Book or twist the words out of Context and pervert the meaning. 
But the real meaning of the Text is this: while reading the Book, they twist 
with their tongues certain words or sentences that are against their self 
interest or self-invented religious beliefs or theories. Thus they change the 
meanings so as to mislead people into mental errors or false judgments or wrong 
religious beliefs. It is an irony that some people sometimes treat the Qur'an 
itself in the same way. For instance, those people who believe in the Holy 
Prophet to be superhuman twist verse 110 of chapter XVIII with their tongues and 
read it The first and correct reading means, "Say, (O Prophet), I also am a man 
like yourselves," while the second reading perverts the meaning thus: "Say, (O 
prophet), indeed' 1 am not a man like yourselves. " <br><br>67Rabbani (rabbi) 
was the title of a religious functionary who guided the religious affairs of the 
Jews, established worship and expounded law. <br><br>68These two verses are a 
comprehensive refutation of all the wrong things that different people have 
ascribed to their Prophets and entered into their Books in order to make an 
angel or a Prophet a god and an object of worship. Here a fundamental formula 
has been laid down: anything that teaches the worship of anyone other than Allah 
and raises a servant of God to the high pedestal of Godhead can never be the 
teaching of any Messenger of God: therefore the very existence of such a thing 
in any book should be taken as a clear proof of its being a later insertion by 
some misguided people. Hence the claim "to be the son of God and equal with 
God," could never have been made by Jesus himself, but by some misguided 
followers of his. <br><br>69It implies this: "You people of the Book are bound 
by the Covenant of your own Prophets to believe in and help Muhammad (Allah's 
peace be upon him) for we entered into a compact with every Prophet to the 
effect that they (and their followers by implication) must help every Prophet 
sent by Us for the preaching and the establishment of the way of life for which 
they had been appointed. Therefore you should not have any prejudice against 
him, nor consider religion as your own monopoly; you should not oppose the Truth 
but come under the banner of anyone who raises it for this purpose.<br><br>It is 
interesting to note that according to Palmer (The Koran), "the Talmudic sources 
confirm that God assembled all past, present, and future Prophets on Mount Sinai 
and entered into the compact mentioned in the text."<br><br>In this connection 
it should also be clearly understood that this compact was taken from every 
Prophet before the advent of Hadrat Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him); 
therefore every Prophet informed his followers about the Prophet coming after 
him and told them to follow him. But there is no mention in the Qur'an or in the 
Traditions that any such compact was taken from the Holy Prophet: nor did he 
inform his followers about the coming of any Prophet after him and believing in 
him. On the contrary, he categorically declared that he was the last in the line 
of Prophets. <br><br>70This implies that the people of the Book were breaking 
their covenant with Allah by rejecting Prophet Muhammad (God's peace be upon 
him) and opposing his mission; they were disregarding that covenant which their 
Prophets had made with Allah. Hence they were perverted transgressors who had 
gone beyond the limits imposed by Allah.<br><br>71That is, "When the whole 
universe and everything in it follow `Islam' and submit to Allah, what other way 
of life than Islam do these rejectors, who live in the same universe, seek to 
follow?" <br><br>72That is, "We do not have different ways of treatment for 
different Prophets: we accept each and everyone of them and do not reject any 
one of them and we treat all of them as truthful Prophets and none as a liar. We 
are free from prejudice and zeal for ignorance; we bear witness to the fact that 
each and every servant of Allah, who brought the Truth from Him to any place 
whatever in the world, was in the right.<br><br>73It has been reiterated here 
that the Jewish scholars, who lived in Arabia at the time of the Holy Prophet, 
had understood clearly and borne witness to it that he was a true Prophet of God 
and that his teachings were the same as those of the former Prophets. But in 
spite of this, they not only rejected but also opposed him because of their 
centuries-old prejudices, obduracy and antagonism to the Truth.<br><br>74"They 
persisted in their disbelief" : they did not stop at the rejection of the Faith 
but went on further and further in their opposition and antagonism to it: they 
did their very worst to hinder people from the way of Allah by creating doubts 
and suspicions in their minds and by devising secret plans and plots to make the 
mission a failure. <br><br>75It is meant to remove the misconception of the Jews 
about virtue. Their highest ideal of virtue was to put on that outward 
appearance which had been enjoined by the traditional and centuries-old heritage 
of their ancestors. Besides this they measured virtue by the standard of that 
elaborate legal system which had been evolved by their hair-splitting scholars. 
But in spite of their outward religiosity, even their `pious' people were 
narrow-minded, greedy and parsimonious. Moreover they did not hesitate to 
conceal the Truth or to sell it, and yet the common people took them for 
virtuous people. This is why they are being told here that they can attain to 
real virtue not by the mere outward observance of some rituals of their own 
invention but by loving God and by keeping His will above every worldly thing. 
As the door of virtue is shut against anyone who loves any worldly thing more 
than Allah, the one, who is not ready to sacrifice the beloved thing for the 
sake of God's love, cannot attain to real virtue. The observance of rituals 
without this spirit of love is like the paint on worm-eaten wood. It is possible 
that a human being might be deceived by such outward paint, but it is impossible 
to deceive God by such devices. <br><br>76Verse 93 answers an objection. When 
the Jews could not find fault with the basic teachings of the Qur'an and of the 
Holy Prophet (Allah's peace be upon him), for there was absolutely no difference 
between these and the teachings of the previous Prophets, they began to raise 
legal objections. One of their objections was that the Holy Prophet had made 
lawful certain things which had been unlawful during the time of the previous 
Prophets. <br><br>77If Israel refers to the children of Israel, then it would 
mean that before the revelation of the Torah, they themselves had made certain 
things unlawful because these had been unlawful by custom. But if it refers to 
Jacob (and that is more probable), then it means that he did not eat certain 
things because he did not like them or abstained from them on account of some 
illness, but his children began to believe these to be unlawful. The subsequent 
verse shows that the law in the Bible which declared the camel and the hare 
etc., to be unlawful was not in the Torah, but was later on inserted in it by 
the Jewish scholars. (For details please refer to E. N. 122 of Al-An'am). <br>
<br>78It is meant to bring home to them this lesson: obedience to God alone is 
the root of the real Faith, which was taught by Abraham, but you have discarded 
that and associated other gods with Him. Besides this, you have , entangled 
yourselves in minor legal issues which had been raised by your scholars after 
you had deviated from the way of Abraham during the centuries of your 
degradation. <br><br>79Their objection was about the change of qiblah to the 
Ka`abah (Makkah) from the Temple (Jerusalem), which had been the qiblah of the 
previous Prophets. This objection had already been answered in Al-Baqarah, but 
as the Jews persisted in their criticism, it has again been answered here. It 
has been asserted that the Ka`abah was built by Abraham long before the Temple 
and therefore it had priority of time for being the qiblah. The Bible itself 
bears testimony to the fact that the Temple was built by Solomon some 450 years 
after Moses (I Kings, 6: 1) and made qiblah during his reign. (I Kings, 8: 
29-30.) On the other hand, all the traditions of Arabia unanimously agree that 
the Ka`abah was built by Abraham some 900 years before the advent of Moses. The 
fact that the Ka`abah has priority of time over the Temple is so obvious that 
none can deny it. <br><br>80There are such clear Signs in "the House:" to show 
that Allah has accepted it and approved it as "His House." Though it has been 
built in a barren place, Allah has provided the people of the neighbourhood with 
the best of provisions. Besides this, though there was chaos and disorder in the 
whole of Arabia for about 2500 years before the advent of Islam, yet there 
reigned peace and security in the Ka`abah and in its surroundings. Not only 
this: there was because of it, peace for four months every year in the whole of 
Arabia. Another Sign was the miraculous destruction of Abrahah and his army, 
when he attacked Makkah in order to destroy the Ka'abah. At the time of the 
Revelation of the Qur'an, every Arab knew well even the details of this incident 
and there wen even those who had actually beheld the occurrence. <br><br>81The 
inviolable sanctity of the Ka`abah was so much respected even in the dark days 
of ignorance that blood thirsty enemies dared not touch each other in it. In v. 
97, the word kafara does not mean that the one, who disobeys this Commandment of 
Allah and does not perform Haj even if one can afford it, becomes a disbeliever 
in the technical sense. It means that the person has adopted the attitude of a 
disbeliever even after his profession of belief in Allah and His Prophet. This 
is obvious because the Commandment to perform Haj has not been addressed to the 
disbelievers but to those who profess to be Muslims. A Muslim judge, therefore, 
will not declare him to be a disbeliever and apostate for this reason, as if he 
had gone out of the pale of Islam.<br><br>"Allah does not stand .... world :" 
Allah does not stand in need of any help from the people, whether they be 
believers or dis-believers. It is for their own good if they become sincere 
believers. On the other hand, those people, who reject the Commandments of Allah 
by word or deed, will not be considered to be Believers by Allah, even if they 
professed to be Believers<br><br>82That is, "Be loyal and obedient to Allah up 
to your last breath." <br><br>83"Allah's cord" is the way of life prescribed by 
Him. It is a "cord" because it keeps intact the relations of the Believers with 
Allah and also binds and unites them into a community. "Hold fast together to 
Allah's cord" implies that the Muslims should give the greatest importance to 
Allah's Way, and should make it the centre of all their interests, and exert 
their utmost to establish it and co-operate with one another for its service. 
When and if they let loose this cord and deviate from its basic principles, they 
would inevitably suffer from disunity and would be divided into sections and 
sub-sections, like the communities of the former Prophets. As a consequence of 
this, they would mat with disgrace both in this world and in the Next. <br><br>
84This refers to that horrible state of the Arabs from which they were rescued 
by Islam. Before Islam, their clans were divided into hostile camps, who went to 
war for frivolous reasons. Human life had lost its sanctity and people were 
killed without any pangs of conscience. The fire of enmity would have burnt to 
ashes all the Arabs, if blessed Islam had not rescued them from it. This 
blessing had appeared in a tangible form at AI-Madinah at the time of the 
revelation of these verses. The two clans-Aus and Khazraj-who had been enemies 
for years and had been involved in bitter feuds and bloody battles, became 
brethren after they embraced Islam. Not only this: they also showed that spirit 
of sacrifice for the rehabilitation of the refugees from Makkah that has no 
parallel in history. <br><br>85That is to say, "If you have eyes to see, you can 
yourselves judge whether your welfare lies in holding fast to Allah's way or in 
discarding it and reverting to the old ways of ignorance, and whether your 
well-wishers are Allah and His Messenger or the Jews and the hypocrites and the 
polytheists who are trying to revert you to your former condition.<br><br>86This 
refers to those communities which received the Guidance and clear teachings from 
the Messengers of Allah but after some time discarded the basic principles of 
the Guidance and divided themselves into different sects on the basis of 
irrelevant and minor side-issues and were involved in useless and meaningless 
squabbles. They became so engrossed in these things that they totally forgot the 
mission which Allah had entrusted to them and lost interest even in the basic 
principles on which, in fact, depends the real success of humanity. <br><br>87As 
Allah, does not will to be unjust to the people of the world, He is showing them 
Guidance and warning them before-hand of those things of which they shall have 
ultimately to render an account. Thus, those who follow the crooked ways even 
after this and do not return to the Right Way are doing injustice to themselves
<br><br>88This is the same declaration that has been' made in Al-Baqarah (v. 
143). The followers of the Holy Prophet are being reminded that they have been 
appointed to the leadership of the world from which the children of Israel had 
been deposed on account of their incompetence. The Muslims have been appointed 
to that office because they possess those moral qualities which are essential 
for just leadership. These are to establish virtue and to eradicate evil 
practically and believe that there is no god other than Allah to put into 
practice the implication of this belief. They should, therefore, understand the 
responsibilities of the work which had been entrusted to them and avoid the 
errors into which their predecessors had fallen. (Please refer also to E. N. 
123-144 of Al-Baqarah). <br><br>89Here the Jews are "The people of the Book. "
<br><br>90That is, "The little security that they enjoy anywhere in the world 
has not been won by themselves but has been the result of the help and kindness 
of others. They have been getting this either from some Muslim states in the 
name of Allah or from some non-Muslim states for other reasons." And if 
sometimes they have succeeded in gaining even some political power, they have 
not accomplished this through their own efforts but have owed it to others.<br>
<br>91In this similitude, "tillage" stands for human life, for one sows in it 
deeds or misdeeds which one shall have to harvest in the Next World. The "wind" 
refers to the superficial and hypocritical show of charity that impels the 
unbelievers to spend their wealth in charity and public works. And "frost" 
refers to the lack of faith and willingness to obey the Divine Law in its right 
spirit, which makes void the acts and deeds of one's life. By this similitude, 
Allah teaches this lesson; just as air is very useful for the growth of crops 
but it also destroys these if there is frost in it: in the same way charity 
helps nourish the harvest that is to be reaped in the Next World but it destroys 
the same, if it is poisoned with unbelief.<br><br>It is obvious that Allah is 
the Master of man as well as of the wealth that he possesses and of the kingdom 
in which he is acting. Now, if this slave of Allah does not acknowledge the 
Sovereignty of his Master or unlawfully sets up other objects of worship and 
does not obey His Law in his exploitation of His wealth and kingdom, he shall be 
guilty of a crime. Therefore, he will not be entitled to any reward for his 
charity, but shall be prosecuted for his unlawful exploitation. The charity of 
such a man maybe likened to the charity of a servant who steals a sum of money 
from the treasure of his master and spends it as he likes. <br><br>92Here Allah 
warns the Muslims to guard against the hypocritical attitude of the Jews who 
lived in the suburbs of Al-Madinah. The two clans, Aus and Khazraj, had been on 
friendly terms with them from very ancient times and kept sincere relations with 
them even after embracing Islam. In contrast to this, the Jews, who had turned 
into the enemies of the Holy Prophet and his mission, could not be friendly with 
anyone who had joined the new Movement. Accordingly, they kept up an outward 
show of friendship with the Ansar but in their heart of hearts they had become 
their bitter enemies. They, however, . exploited this outward friendship and 
tried to sow seeds of dissension and create chaos in the Muslim Community. They 
also tried to draw out secrets from the Muslims and pass them on to their 
enemies. That is why Allah has warned the Muslims that they should not take such 
people into their confidence. <br><br>93That is, "It is strange that the Jews, 
who themselves are guilty of rejecting your Book, whereas you believe in their 
Book, the Torah, along with your Book, the Qur'an, should have a grievance 
against you. There is no reason why they should complain against you: on the 
other hand, you have a cogent grievance against them for their disbelief in your 
Book." <br><br>94From here begins the fourth discourse, which was revealed after 
the battle of Uhd. It has been beautifully connected with the previous discourse 
which ended with the admonition that the machinations of their enemies could do 
them no harm, if they would show restraint, and fear Allah. This discourse is an 
apt continuation of the same theme, because the setback in the battle of Uhd was 
due to lack of restraint and lack of fear of Allah.<br><br>As a review has been 
made of all the important events of the battle in order to bring home the 
lessons, it will be very useful to keep in view their background, because in the 
discourse only passing references have been made to them without any details.<br>
<br>In the beginning of Shawwal (A.H. 3), the Quraish attacked Al-Madinah with 
an army of 3,000 men. They not only out-numbered the Muslims but were also much 
better equipped. Besides this, they were filled with passion to avenge their 
defeat at Badr. The Holy Prophet and his experienced Companions were of the 
opinion that they should defend Al-Madinah from within the walls, but some young 
men, who had not taken part in the battle of Badr, were so imbued with the 
spirit of martyrdom that they insisted on going out to meet the enemy. At last 
on their persistence, the Holy Prophet decided to go out to fight. So he led out 
an army of 1,000 men but at Shaut, `Abdullah bin Ubayy, the ring leader of the 
hypocrites, deserted him with his 300 men. Naturally this treacherous act 
produced much confusion in the Muslim army. So much so that two parties, Banu 
Salmah and Banu Harithah, were so disheartened that they began to waver in their 
minds and were about to turn back, but were dissuaded from this by those 
Companions who had remained firm and constant.<br><br>Then the Holy Prophet 
marched to Mount Uhd with the 700 men left with him after the desertion of 
`Abdullah bin Ubayy. He arrayed his men at the foot of the Mount so that the 
army of the Quraish was in their front and Mount Uhd at their back. Thus the 
only vulnerable point was a pass on one side, where he posted 50 archers under 
the command of `Abdullah bin Jubair, saying, " to let not any enemy come near us 
and do not leave your posts in any case whatsoever. Even if you see birds peck 
at our flesh, you should not abandon your posts at all. "<br><br>In the initial 
stage of the battle, the Muslim army had the upper hand and succeeded in 
creating great confusion in the army of the enemy. But instead, of pursuing this 
initial success to the final victory, they were so lured by their greed for 
booty that they began to loot the spoils. When the archers, who were guarding 
the pass, saw their comrades plundering the fleeing enemy, they also deserted 
their posts in order to join the looters. In vain did Hadrat `Abdullah bin 
Jubair remind them of the strict command of the Holy Prophet to dissuade them 
from this, but only a few of them listened to him. Khalid bin Walid, who was 
commanding the cavalry of the enemy, made full use of this opportune moment. He 
rode round the Mount and attacked the Muslims from behind through the pass. 
Hadrat `Abdullah . bin Jubair did his best to defend it with the few men left 
with him, but in vain, and Khalid fell upon the Muslims who were engaged in the 
plunder of spoils. They were so overwhelmed by this sudden attack from behind 
that they took to their heels in confusion. To add to their misery, the Quraish 
who were in flight before them also turned back to attack them from the front. 
This turned the scale of the battle against the Muslims who were put to rout by 
this unexpected situation. Still there were some brave Muslims who stood firmly 
in the battle-field. But then a rumour started that the Holy Prophet had been 
martyred, and his Companions were so stunned by this rumour that even those who 
were standing firm in the battle-field lost heart and only a dozen or so of the 
devoted ones were left with him. Thus it was about to turn into an utter rout, 
when his Companions heard that, though he was wounded, he was alive. Then they 
again rallied round him and took him to a safe side of the Mount.<br><br>In this 
connection it is very important to note the strange thing that happened: the 
Quraish did not make full use of this opportunity but marched back to Makkah 
instead. This is an enigma, for, if they had pursued their success to complete 
victory, nothing would have checked them, because the Muslims had been so 
utterly routed that they could not have given them a battle.<br><br>95The two 
groups were Banu Salmah and Banu Harithah who had wavered in their minds at the 
desertion of `Abdullah bin Ubayy, the hypocrite, and his 300 followers. <br><br>
96The Holy Prophet heartened the Muslims with this promise when they were 
disheartened to confront an army of 3,000 men with a small army of 1,000 which 
was further reduced to 700 men by the desertion of 300 hypocrites. <br><br>
97These verses were an answer to the curse which the Holy Prophet called on his 
enemies: when he was wounded in the battle, he involuntarily invoked evil upon 
his enemies and said, "How can that community prosper which wounds the Prophet?"
<br><br>98The main cause of the setback at Uhd was the greed for wealth shown by 
the Muslims. They were so overpowered by the lust for booty, that, instead of 
pursuing their initial success to victory, they got engaged in looting the 
spoils. This is why the All-Wise Allah has struck at interest, the root cause of 
the evils and prohibited it. For it is a common experience that those who lend 
money on interest become so absorbed in it that day and night they think of 
nothing but increasing their un-earned profits and this naturally increases 
their greed for money. <br><br>99The devouring of interest had created greed, 
avarice, parsimony and selfishness in those who took interest; hatred, anger, 
enmity and jealousy in those who had to pay it, and these moral evils 
contributed to some extent to the setback in the Battle of Uhd. Therefore Allah 
has condemned and prohibited interest and prescribed charity as an antidote to 
it. It is obvious that Paradise has been reserved for those who practise charity 
and spend money generously, and not for those greedy persons who practise 
money-lending on interest. (Please refer also to E. N. 320, Al-Baqarah.) <br>
<br>100God is encouraging the Muslims by mentioning the victory in the battle of 
Badr, saying, "When the disbelievers did not lose heart by the blow at Badr, why 
should you, the believers, lose heart by the blow at Uhd?" <br><br>101The 
original Arabic text may imply either of the two things: "Allah desired to give 
some of you the honour of martyrdom. " Or it may mean, "He willed to winnow the 
Believers from the hypocrites so that the true witnesses of the Truth, who may 
really be worthy of performing the mission that has been assigned to the Muslim 
Community, may be distinguished from the false ones." <br><br>102This alludes to 
those who were so desirous of martyrdom that they had persuaded the Holy Prophet 
against his wish to go out of Al-Madinah to fight with the enemy. <br><br>
103This is the answer to the mischievous talk of those hypocrites who had 
accompanied the Muslims in the battle of Uhd. When the rumour spread that the 
Holy Prophet had been slain, naturally the we Muslims lost heart, but the 
hypocrites began to say, "Let us go to `Abdullah bin Ubayy and request him to 
obtain amnesty for us from Abu Sufyan. " Others who were more impudent, went 
even so far as to say, "If Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) had been a true 
Prophet of Allah, he could not have been slain. Let us now turn to our ancestral 
Faith." Allah rebukes them as if to say, "Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) 
is a Prophet, and is mortal like other Prophets who came before him: therefore, 
if your attachment to Islam is because of the person of Muhammad (Allah's peace 
be upon him), and if it stands on such flimsy ground that with his death you 
will again return to disbelief, then Allah's religion does not stand in need of 
you."<br><br>This verse was also meant to impress that Muhammad (Allah's peace 
be upon him) was mortal like all other Prophets. According to a tradition, on 
the morning when the Prophet died, Abu Bakr came into the mosque at Al-Madinah 
and found the people all distracted, and `Umar telling them that it was a sin to 
say that he was dead. Abu Bakr went and ascertained the truth, and coming back 
into the mosque, cried, "Lo! as for him who worshipped Muhammad, Muhammad 
(Allah's peace be upon him) is dead, but as for him who worships Allah, Allah is 
alive and does not die." Then he recited this verse "and it was as if the people 
had not known till then that such a verse had been revealed."<br><br>104This is 
meant to teach the Muslims that fleeing from fear of death will be of no avail, 
because none shall die a moment before the time ordained for death by Allah, nor 
can one live a moment after it. Therefore, what one should care for, is not how 
to escape from death but how best to spend the time that has been given in this 
world. The important question is this: Is it to be spent for the sake of this 
worldly life or for the Life-after-death? <br><br>105As the consequences of all 
actions follow them inevitably, the most important question from the Islamic 
point of view is whether one's struggle in life is to be directed towards the 
transitory interests and enjoyments of this world or towards the ever-lasting 
joys of the Next World. The answer to this will determine one's moral attitude 
in regard to good and evil. <br><br>106"Grateful servants" are those people who 
appreciate fully the blessings of Allah, which He has bestowed upon them by 
giving them the correct answer to the question posed in E. N. 105. He has 
informed them that there is a limitless life beyond the limited life of this 
world and that the consequences of the actions of this life are not confined to 
this life alone, but follow inevitably in the Life-after-death. Hence he is 
really a grateful servant who trusts in God's promise of sure reward of good 
deeds in the Next World, and then goes on performing those deeds, disregarding 
whether his deeds flourish in this life or produce the reverse results. On the 
other hand, those people are ungrateful who are not ready and willing to spend 
their time or money or energy on anything that is not expected to produce 
immediate "good" results in this world. They are ungrateful because they do not 
appreciate the correct knowledge which has been bestowed by God about the 
consequences which inevitably follow in the everlasting life in the Next World.
<br><br>107That is, "They did not surrender to the worshippers of falsehood, 
even though they were less in number and worse off in equipment than their 
enemies. " <br><br>108That is, "They will take you back to the state of 
un-belief from which you had come out." This warning was timely because after 
the reverse at Uhd, the hypocrites and the Jews tried to seduce the Muslims from 
their Faith. Their fallacious reasoning was like this: "Had Muhammad been a 
Prophet, he would never have suffered a defeat. It is obvious from this that he 
is an ordinary man who gets victory one day and suffers defeat another day. It 
is sheer propaganda that Allah had given him any promise of help and success."<br>
<br>108aThis refers to the conduct of the archers. When they were commanded to 
abstain from taking spoils, they argued with and disobeyed their leader and 
deserted their positions with the result that the scales of victory were turned 
against the Muslims.<br><br>109That is, "Your desertion was an act which would 
have resulted in your total destruction, if Allah had not pardoned you. It was 
God's grace and succour that saved you from its grave consequences, and the 
Quraish, in spite of their victory, retreated of their own accord without any 
apparent reason. " <br><br>110It was the courage and firmness of the Holy 
Prophet that saved the situation from utter ruin in the confusion caused by the 
sudden attack of the enemy who was charging from the front and from the rear. 
When some of the Muslims were fleeing towards Al-Madinah and the others were 
climbing up the Uhd, the Holy Prophet stood firm and resolute at his post with a 
dozen or so of his Companions who had stood the test. He was rallying those who 
were taking to flight, calling out, "O servants of Allah, come to me." <br><br>
111Sorrow was caused by the reverse and by the rumour that the Holy Prophet had 
been martyred and by the loss of their companions and by the misery of their 
wounded and by the insecurity of their homes and by the fear that the victorious 
Quraish army, that out-numbered the total population of Al-Madinah, would crush 
the routed army, enter into .the town and reduce it to ruins.<br><br>112This was 
a favour shown to those Muslims who had remained firm in the battle. They 
experienced such a strange sense of security that in spite of their sorrow, they 
began to feel drowsy. Hadrat Abu Talhah, who had taken part in the battle, says 
that they were so overpowered by drowsiness that even their swords began to fall 
from their hands.<br><br>113These were their vain regrets which were the result 
of their wrong thinking. The fact is that the decrees of God are inevitable. 
Such regrets produce only grief and anguish in the hearts of those who do not 
trust in Allah but in their own plans and designs. However, when their efforts 
also end in utter failure, they wring their hands, saying, "Oh! had it been thus 
and thus, the result would have been so and so."<br><br>114This is the answer to 
the suspicion of the archers about the honesty of the Holy Prophet in regard to 
the division of the spoils. When they saw their companions plunder the enemy, 
the archers feared that the former would get the whole of the spoil and they 
would be deprived of it at the time of division; just because they had not taken 
part in the plunder. That is why they spontaneously deserted their posts. When 
later on they put forward some lame excuses, these were not accepted. Then the 
Holy Prophet said, "The real thing is that you had no trust in me. You suspected 
that I would deal dishonestly with you and would not give you your due share." 
In this verse Allah has taken them to task for cherishing such wrong ideas about 
the Holy Prophet, by putting searching questions as if to say, "How is it that 
you suspected that your interests would not be safe in the hands of the Prophet 
of Allah? Can you ever expect that the Messenger of Allah would divide unjustly 
the wealth that is in his trusteeship."<br><br>115This verse is meant to remove 
the confusion caused in the minds of the common Muslims by the reverse at Uhd. 
Though the intimate Companions close to the Holy Prophet were under no delusion 
that his mere presence among them was a sure guarantee of success, yet the 
common Muslims were suffering from this misunderstanding. They thought that the 
disbelievers could in no way win a victory over them because the Holy Prophet 
was present among them and the help and succour of Allah was with them. 
Therefore, when contrary to their expectations, they met with a reverse at Uhd, 
they began to ask questions like this: why has this misfortune befallen us, who 
were fighting for the cause of Allah, and that, too, at the hands of the 
disbelievers, who had come to destroy Islam? Above all, they could not 
understand this because Allah had promised to help and succour them and the Holy 
Prophet was himself present in the battlefield. They have been told that they 
themselves were responsible for the disaster. <br><br>116In the battle of Uhd, 
70 Muslims were martyred whereas in the battle of Badr, 70 disbelievers were 
killed and 70 taken as prisoners. <br><br>117That is, "It is the result of your 
own weakness and wrong acts: you did not show patience; you did things which 
were against piety; you disobeyed the order of your leader; you became victims 
of greed and you got engaged in disputes among yourselves: still you ask, "Where 
has this disaster come from?" defeat.<br><br>118That is, "Allah is able to give 
victory and is also able to bring about <br><br>119This was the pretext with 
which `Abdullah bin Ubayy returned to AlMadinah with his 300 men from his way to 
the battlefield. When the Muslims perceived that he was about to desert the 
Muslim army, they tried to persuade him to accompany them but he replied, "We 
are quite certain that there will be no battle today. That is why we are 
returning home; we would have most surely accompanied you, if we had expected 
any battle today." <br><br>120Please refer to E. N. 155', AI-Baqarah. <br><br>
121It has been explained by the Holy Prophet in the Tradition cited in Musnad-i 
Ahmad. "One, who enters the Next World with good deeds, is blessed by Allah with 
such a cheerful and joyful life that he never wishes to return to this world, 
but the case of a martyr is different. He dces wish that he should again be sent 
to this world so that he may again enjoy the pleasure, joy and exultation that 
he felt at the time of laying down his life in the way of Allah." <br><br>
122This verse alludes to those devoted servants of Islam who willingly 
accompanied the Holy Prophet in his pursuit of the Quraish at that critical 
juncture.<br><br>After the Battle of Uhd, the Quraish marched back towards 
Makkah. When they had covered a good deal of distance from Al-Madinah, they 
realized that they had not utilised the golden opportunity of crushing the power 
of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and they began to regret: what a folly 
have we committed by losing that excellent chance! Accordingly, they halted and 
held a council of war. Though they were in favour of returning to Al-Madinah and 
making a sudden attack, yet they could not muster up courage and continued their 
march towards Makkah. At the same time, the Holy Prophet surmised an attack from 
the enemy; so he assembled the Muslims on the next day after the battle of Uhd 
and said, "Let us go in pursuit of the Quraish." Although that was a very 
critical situation, yet the believers and the devoted servants of Allah 
responded to the call and willingly marched with the Holy Prophet to 
Hamra-ul-Asad, a place at a distance of 8 miles from Al-Madinah. <br><br>123VV. 
173-175 were sent down a year after the Battle of Uhd, but have been included in 
this discourse because they deal with the events which are connected with the 
same. <br><br>124This refers to the terrifying rumours which were being spread 
in Al-Madinah. On the occasion of his return from Uhd, Abu Sufyan had challenged 
the Muslims to a fight the following year at Badr. But when the time approached, 
he could not fmd courage on account of the famine that was raging in Makkah. So 
in order to save face, he tried to shift on to the Muslims the responsibility 
for the postponement. Accordingly, he sent a special spy to Al-Madinah to 
terrify them by spreading rumours that the Quraish were making great 
preparations for war and collecting such a large army as could defeat any army 
in Arabia. This device of Abu Sufyan succeeded in producing the desired panic. 
When the Holy Prophet made an appeal to the Muslims to meet the Quraish in 
combat at Badr, it failed to produce any encouraging response. So much so that 
the Messenger of Allah had to declare before the gathered assembly, "I will go 
to the combat all alone, if none else is willing to go." It was then that 1,500 
devotees volunteered to accompany him, and he reached Badr with them. From the 
other side,Abu Sufyan left Makkah with an army of 2,000 men. But after two days' 
journey, he told his men that it did not appear to suit them to have a fight 
that year, and that they would come next year for it. Accordingly, he returned 
to Makkah with his men. The Holy Prophet, however, waited for him at Badr for 
eight days. During these days, his Companions did profitable business with a 
trading party. Then he came to know that the disbelievers had gone back to 
Makkah, and he returned to Al Madinah.<br><br>125That is, "Allah does not like 
to see the Believers remaining mixed up with the hypocrites in one and the same 
Muslim Community." <br><br>126That is, "Allah does not separate the believers 
from the hypocrites by informing the Muslims that, in their heart of hearts, 
such and such are hypocrites." He distinguishes true believers from hypocrites 
by creating such occasions as practically separate the two groups from each 
other. <br><br>127Everything shall ultimately return to God as His inheritance 
because it really belongs to God. Whatever is in the possession of any of His 
creatures is a temporary trust. Everyone in every case shall be dis-possessed of 
the property and wealth that he calls his own during the short life here and 
that shall ultimately return to God, the real Owner. Therefore the wise one is 
he who generously spends Allah's property in Allah's way and the foolish one is 
he who tries to hoard it.<br><br>128The Jews uttered these words on the occasion 
of the revelation of verse 245 of AI-Baqarah, "Who is there among you, who will 
lend to Allah a goodly loan..." They ridiculed this appeal, saying, "Oh, yes! 
God has been reduced to poverty, and now He is begging His servants for a loan."
<br><br>129This was a lie invented and attributed to God by the Jews, for Allah 
never enjoined such a thing. Though burnt sacrifices have been mentioned in the 
Bible, these have not been held out as essential signs of true Prophethood. They 
were merely symbols of the acceptance of sacrifices by God. (Please refer to 
Judges, 6: 20-21, 13: 19-20, Leviticus, 9: 24, II Chronicles, 7: 1-2).<br><br>It 
is obvious that this demand was merely a pretext for rejecting the Prophethood 
of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). As a further proof of their 
insincerity, it may be recalled that these enemies of the Truth did not hesitate 
to slay even some of their own Prophets who showed to them this same Sign of the 
burnt sacrifice. The case of Elijah may be cited as an instance: "When Ahab did 
more to vex the Eternal than all the kings of Israel before him, Elijah went to 
him and remonstrated that He had ruined Israel by forsaking the Eternal. So Ahab 
gathered all Israel. Then Elijah told the people to have a couple of bullocks 
for the test of the burnt sacrifice. Of course, the "Prophets" of Baal failed in 
the test. Then God's lightning burnt the sacrifice and all Israel witnessed it 
but even after this they turned against Elijah who had to flee for his life.' 
(For details please refer to 1 Kings, 18 and 19). <br><br>130The life of this 
world (as it appears) is a thing that deceives because it helps create false 
impressions which deceive one about me ultimate results of deeds and misdeeds. 
One may thus be misled to take apparent prosperity or adversity as the criterion 
of Truth or falsehood. If one is apparently prosperous in this life, it is wrong 
to conclude that the one is on the right side and high in God's favour. On the 
other hand, if another is suffering from misfortunes and is a victim of 
adversity, it does not necessarily mean that the one is on the wrong side and 
incurs the disfavour of God. For often the results in this world are just the 
opposite of those which are to be met with in the Next World. The latter are, 
however, real and therefore deserve one's greatest consideration. <br><br>
131That is, "You should prove the strength of your high character even in the 
face of provocation by keeping your temper under control. Endure with patience 
their taunts, derision, accusations and improper words and false propaganda. Do 
not get exasperated even in the most trying circumstances so as to say or do 
false, unjust, uncivilized and immoral things." <br><br>132That is, "Remind them 
of the Covenant that God made with them and of the great mission that was 
entrusted to them because they had forgotten it, though they did remember the 
sign of the burnt sacrifices given to some of their Prophets. "<br><br>The 
Covenant referred to in this verse has been mentioned many times in the Bible, 
especially a has been repeated over and over again in Deuteronorny. Prophet 
Moses exhorted them not to "add unto the word" nor to "diminish aught from it" 
and to "keep the commandments of the Lord." (4: 2); and to "teach them 
diligently unto thy children", and to talk of them when thou sittest in their 
house and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou 
risest up, write them upon the posts of thy house, and on the gates." (6: 7, 9) 
In his last will, he urged the elders of Israel to "set up great stones in mount 
Ebal after crossing the boundary line of Palestine". (27: 2-4).<br><br>Here is 
an instance of their negligence of the Book. Prophet Moses entrusted one copy of 
the Torah to the Levites and instructed them to recite it word . by word every 
seventh year on the occasion of the Pass-over Festival before a gathering of all 
Israel-men, women and children. But owing to their gross negligence of their 
duty, within seven hundred years of the death of Moses, they had even forgotten 
that there was such a Book as Torah. so much so that even the high priest of the 
Temple and the Jewish king of Jerusalem were ignoram of its existence. (11 
Kings, 22: 8-13) <br><br>133For instance, such people wish to hear people praise 
them for being very pious, religious, God-fearing servants of the Faith and 
defenders of the law, when, in fact, they possess none of the characteristics, 
or they desire that propaganda should be made in their favour that such and such 
is an embodiment of self-sacrifice, sincerity and honesty and has rendered 
meritorious services w the community, when in fact, he is quite the opposite of 
it.<br><br>134From here begins the concluding part of. the Surah and it has no 
direct connection with the preceding verses, but with the Surah as a whole. 
Therefore it is worth while to turn to the introduction to this Surah to 
understand this portion. <br><br>135That is, "These Signs can help one 
understand the Reality, provided that one is not unmindful of God and observes 
the phenomena of Nature like a thinking person and not like an animal." <br><br>
136A close observation of the system of the Universe leads them to the right 
conclusion that most surely there is a life in the Hereafter with its rewards 
and punishments. The system itself speaks eloquently of the great wisdom that 
underlies it, so it follows that the All-Wise Creator must have a definite 
purpose in the creation of Man. Moreover, the very fact, that He placed 
everything at man's disposal and has endowed him with a moral sense to 
discriminate between good and bad, clearly shows that he must be accountable to 
Him as to whether he had fulfilled that purpose. Consequently he should be 
rewarded for the good he dces in this world and punished for the evil. This 
thinking leads one to the conclusion that there must be a life-after-death, 
where one will be accountable for his deeds. This realization fills man's heart 
with fear of punishment in the Hereafter, and he spontaneously prays to Him to 
save him from the Hell-fire. <br><br>137In the same way, this observation also 
convinces right thinking men that the point of view of the Messengers about the 
beginning and the end of the Universe and the purpose of its creation is the 
correct one; hence the way of life preached and prescribed by them is the only 
right way. <br><br>138It does not mean that they have any doubts about the 
promises of Allah, but this merely shows that they are anxious to know whether 
they themselves are entitled to the blessings that have been promised. That is 
why they pray to God, "Our Lord, forgive us-You do not break your promises," for 
they tear lest they should be ridiculed in the Hereafter by the disbelievers as 
they were here in this world by such taunts at these; "Look at these people-even 
their Faith in the Messengers has not saved them from disgrace."<br><br>139That 
is, "In My sight all of you are alike as human bungs and I have the same 
standards of justice and judgment for all, and men should not forget that women 
are of the same "human status as they themselves have. I do not discriminate 
between tnan and woman, master and slave, the black and the white, the high and 
the low." <br><br>140There is a Tradition that VV. 190-195 were recited by the 
Holy Prophet before some non-Muslims who came to him and said, "AlI the Prophets 
brought one Sign or the other with them. For instance, Moses had the miraculous 
staff and his bright hand to show, and Jesus healed the blind and the lepers. 
Please tell us what sign have you brought us as a proof of your Prophethood." 
The Holy . Prophet recited these verses and said, "I have brought this." <br>
<br>141The word sabiru in the original Arabic Text implies two things: Show more 
valour in fighting for the right cause than that which the disbelievers are 
showing for a wrong cause." and "Vie with one another in showing valour in your 
fight with the disbelievers."</p>
