Will ye not receive admonition?</li><li class="collection-item"> If ye would count up the favours of Allah, never would ye be able to number them: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> And Allah doth know what ye conceal, and what ye reveal.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those whom they invoke besides Allah create nothing and are themselves created.</li><li class="collection-item"> (They are things) dead, lifeless: nor do they know when they will be raised up.</li><li class="collection-item"> Your Allah is one Allah: as to those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts refuse to know, and they are arrogant.</li><li class="collection-item"> Undoubtedly Allah doth know what they conceal, and what they reveal: verily He loveth not the arrogant.</li><li class="collection-item"> When it is said to them, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say, "Tales of the ancients!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Let them bear, on the Day of Judgment, their own burdens in full, and also (something) of the burdens of those without knowledge, whom they misled. Alas, how grievous the burdens they will bear!</li><li class="collection-item"> Those before them did also plot (against Allah´s Way): but Allah took their structures from their foundations, and the roof fell down on them from above; and the Wrath seized them from directions they did not perceive.</li><li class="collection-item"> Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will cover them with shame, and say: "Where are My ´partners´ concerning whom ye used to dispute (with the godly)?" Those endued with knowledge will say: "This Day, indeed, are the Unbelievers covered with shame and misery,-</li><li class="collection-item"> "(Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of wrong-doing to their own souls." Then would they offer submission (with the pretence), "We did no evil (knowingly)." (The angels will reply), "Nay, but verily Allah knoweth all that ye did;</li><li class="collection-item"> "So enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein. Thus evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant."</li><li class="collection-item"> To the righteous (when) it is said, "What is it that your Lord has revealed?" they say, "All that is good." To those who do good, there is good in this world, and the Home of the Hereafter is even better and excellent indeed is the Home of the righteous,-</li><li class="collection-item"> Gardens of Eternity which they will enter: beneath them flow (pleasant) rivers: they will have therein all that they wish: thus doth Allah reward the righteous,-</li><li class="collection-item"> (Namely) those whose lives the angels take in a state of purity, saying (to them), "Peace be on you; enter ye the Garden, because of (the good) which ye did (in the world)."</li><li class="collection-item"> Do the (ungodly) wait until the angels come to them, or there comes the Command of thy Lord (for their doom)? So did those who went before them. But Allah wronged them not: nay, they wronged their own souls.</li><li class="collection-item"> But the evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that very (Wrath) at which they had scoffed hemmed them in.</li><li class="collection-item"> The worshippers of false gods say: "If Allah had so willed, we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers,- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than His." So did those who went before them. But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message?</li><li class="collection-item"> For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, (with the Command), "Serve Allah, and eschew Evil": of the People were some whom Allah guided, and some on whom error became inevitably (established). So travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who denied (the Truth).</li><li class="collection-item"> If thou art anxious for their guidance, yet Allah guideth not such as He leaves to stray, and there is none to help them.</li><li class="collection-item"> They swear their strongest oaths by Allah, that Allah will not raise up those who die: Nay, but it is a promise (binding) on Him in truth: but most among mankind realise it not.</li><li class="collection-item"> (They must be raised up), in order that He may manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ, and that the rejecters of Truth may realise that they had indeed (surrendered to) Falsehood.</li><li class="collection-item"> For to anything which We have willed, We but say the word, "Be", and it is.</li><li class="collection-item"> To those who leave their homes in the cause of Allah, after suffering oppression,- We will assuredly give a goodly home in this world; but truly the reward of the Hereafter will be greater. If they only realised (this)!</li><li class="collection-item"> (They are) those who persevere in patience, and put their trust on their Lord.</li><li class="collection-item"> And before thee also the messengers We sent were but men, to whom We granted inspiration: if ye realise this not, ask of those who possess the Message.</li><li class="collection-item"> (We sent them) with Clear Signs and Books of dark prophecies; and We have sent down unto thee (also) the Message; that thou mayest explain clearly to men what is sent for them, and that they may give thought.</li><li class="collection-item"> Do then those who devise evil (plots) feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up, or that the Wrath will not seize them from directions they little perceive?-</li><li class="collection-item"> Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their goings to and fro, without a chance of their frustrating Him?-</li><li class="collection-item"> Or that He may not call them to account by a process of slow wastage - for thy Lord is indeed full of kindness and mercy.</li><li class="collection-item"> Do they not look at Allah´s creation, (even) among (inanimate) things,- How their (very) shadows turn round, from the right and the left, prostrating themselves to Allah, and that in the humblest manner?</li><li class="collection-item"> And to Allah doth obeisance all that is in the heavens and on earth, whether moving (living) creatures or the angels: for none are arrogant (before their Lord).</li><li class="collection-item"> They all revere their Lord, high above them, and they do all that they are commanded.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah has said: "Take not (for worship) two gods: for He is just One Allah: then fear Me (and Me alone)."</li><li class="collection-item"> To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth, and to Him is duty due always: then will ye fear other than Allah?</li><li class="collection-item"> And ye have no good thing but is from Allah: and moreover, when ye are touched by distress, unto Him ye cry with groans;</li><li class="collection-item"> Yet, when He removes the distress from you, behold! some of you turn to other gods to join with their Lord-</li><li class="collection-item"> (As if) to show their ingratitude for the favours we have bestowed on them! then enjoy (your brief day): but soon will ye know (your folly)!</li><li class="collection-item"> And they (even) assign, to things they do not know, a portion out of that which We have bestowed for their sustenance! By Allah, ye shall certainly be called to account for your false inventions.</li><li class="collection-item"> And they assign daughters for Allah! - Glory be to Him! - and for themselves (sons,- the issue) they desire!</li><li class="collection-item"> When news is brought to one of them, of (the birth of) a female (child), his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief!</li><li class="collection-item"> With shame does he hide himself from his people, because of the bad news he has had! Shall he retain it on (sufferance and) contempt, or bury it in the dust? Ah! what an evil (choice) they decide on?</li><li class="collection-item"> To those who believe not in the Hereafter, applies the similitude of evil: to Allah applies the highest similitude: for He is the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> If Allah were to punish men for their wrong-doing, He would not leave, on the (earth), a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: When their Term expires, they would not be able to delay (the punishment) for a single hour, just as they would not be able to anticipate it (for a single hour).</li><li class="collection-item"> They attribute to Allah what they hate (for themselves), and their tongues assert the falsehood that all good things are for themselves: without doubt for them is the Fire, and they will be the first to be hastened on into it!</li><li class="collection-item"> By Allah, We (also) sent (Our messengers) to Peoples before thee; but Satan made, (to the wicked), their own acts seem alluring: He is also their patron today, but they shall have a most grievous penalty.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We sent down the Book to thee for the express purpose, that thou shouldst make clear to them those things in which they differ, and that it should be a guide and a mercy to those who believe.</li><li class="collection-item"> And Allah sends down rain from the skies, and gives therewith life to the earth after its death: verily in this is a Sign for those who listen.</li><li class="collection-item"> And verily in cattle (too) will ye find an instructive sign. From what is within their bodies between excretions and blood, We produce, for your drink, milk, pure and agreeable to those who drink it.</li><li class="collection-item"> And from the fruit of the date-palm and the vine, ye get out wholesome drink and food: behold, in this also is a sign for those who are wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in (men´s) habitations;</li><li class="collection-item"> Then to eat of all the produce (of the earth), and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord: there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours, wherein is healing for men: verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is Allah who creates you and takes your souls at death; and of you there are some who are sent back to a feeble age, so that they know nothing after having known (much): for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others: those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess, so as to be equal in that respect. Will they then deny the favours of Allah?</li><li class="collection-item"> And Allah has made for you mates (and companions) of your own nature, and made for you, out of them, sons and daughters and grandchildren, and provided for you sustenance of the best: will they then believe in vain things, and be ungrateful for Allah´s favours?-</li><li class="collection-item"> And worship others than Allah,- such as have no power of providing them, for sustenance, with anything in heavens or earth, and cannot possibly have such power?</li><li class="collection-item"> Invent not similitudes for Allah: for Allah knoweth, and ye know not.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah sets forth the Parable (of two men: one) a slave under the dominion of another; He has no power of any sort; and (the other) a man on whom We have bestowed goodly favours from Ourselves, and he spends thereof (freely), privately and publicly: are the two equal? (By no means;) praise be to Allah. But most of them understand not.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah sets forth (another) Parable of two men: one of them dumb, with no power of any sort; a wearisome burden is he to his master; whichever way be directs him, he brings no good: is such a man equal with one who commands Justice, and is on a Straight Way?</li><li class="collection-item"> To Allah belongeth the Mystery of the heavens and the earth. And the Decision of the Hour (of Judgment) is as the twingkling of an eye, or even quicker: for Allah hath power over all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers when ye knew nothing; and He gave you hearing and sight and intelligence and affections: that ye may give thanks (to Allah).</li><li class="collection-item"> Do they not look at the birds, held poised in the midst of (the air and) the sky? Nothing holds them up but (the power of) Allah.

Thus does He complete His favours on you, that ye may bow to His Will (in Islam).</li><li class="collection-item"> But if they turn away, thy duty is only to preach the clear Message.</li><li class="collection-item"> They recognise the favours of Allah; then they deny them; and most of them are (creatures) ungrateful.</li><li class="collection-item"> One Day We shall raise from all Peoples a Witness: then will no excuse be accepted from Unbelievers, nor will they receive any favours.</li><li class="collection-item"> When the wrong-doers (actually) see the Penalty, then will it in no way be mitigated, nor will they then receive respite.</li><li class="collection-item"> When those who gave partners to Allah will see their "partners", they will say: "Our Lord! these are our ´partners,´ those whom we used to invoke besides Thee." But they will throw back their word at them (and say): "Indeed ye are liars!"</li><li class="collection-item"> That Day shall they (openly) show (their) submission to Allah; and all their inventions shall leave them in the lurch.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who reject Allah and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah - for them will We add Penalty to Penalty; for that they used to spread mischief.</li><li class="collection-item"> One day We shall raise from all Peoples a witness against them, from amongst themselves: and We shall bring thee as a witness against these (thy people): and We have sent down to thee the Book explaining all things, a Guide, a Mercy, and Glad Tidings to Muslims.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah commands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to kith and kin, and He forbids all shameful deeds, and injustice and rebellion: He instructs you, that ye may receive admonition.</li><li class="collection-item"> Fulfil the Covenant of Allah when ye have entered into it, and break not your oaths after ye have confirmed them; indeed ye have made Allah your surety; for Allah knoweth all that ye do.</li><li class="collection-item"> And be not like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, after it has become strong. Nor take your oaths to practise deception between yourselves, lest one party should be more numerous than another: for Allah will test you by this; and on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make clear to you (the truth of) that wherein ye disagree.</li><li class="collection-item"> If Allah so willed, He could make you all one people: But He leaves straying whom He pleases, and He guides whom He pleases: but ye shall certainly be called to account for all your actions.</li><li class="collection-item"> And take not your oaths, to practise deception between yourselves, with the result that someone´s foot may slip after it was firmly planted, and ye may have to taste the evil (consequences) of having hindered (men) from the Path of Allah, and a Mighty Wrath descend on you.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor sell the covenant of Allah for a miserable price: for with Allah is (a prize) far better for you, if ye only knew.</li><li class="collection-item"> What is with you must vanish: what is with Allah will endure. And We will certainly bestow, on those who patiently persevere, their reward according to the best of their actions.</li><li class="collection-item"> Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, verily, to him will We give a new Life, a life that is good and pure and We will bestow on such their reward according to the best of their actions.</li><li class="collection-item"> When thou dost read the Qur´an, seek Allah´s protection from Satan the rejected one.</li><li class="collection-item"> No authority has he over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord.</li><li class="collection-item"> His authority is over those only, who take him as patron and who join partners with Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> When We substitute one revelation for another,- and Allah knows best what He reveals (in stages),- they say, "Thou art but a forger": but most of them understand not.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say, the Holy Spirit has brought the revelation from thy Lord in Truth, in order to strengthen those who believe, and as a Guide and Glad Tidings to Muslims.</li><li class="collection-item"> We know indeed that they say, "It is a man that teaches him." The tongue of him they wickedly point to is notably foreign, while this is Arabic, pure and clear.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who believe not in the Signs of Allah,- Allah will not guide them, and theirs will be a grievous Penalty.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is those who believe not in the Signs of Allah, that forge falsehood: it is they who lie!</li><li class="collection-item"> Any one who, after accepting faith in Allah, utters Unbelief,- except under compulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith - but such as open their breast to Unbelief, on them is Wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty.</li><li class="collection-item"> This because they love the life of this world better than the Hereafter: and Allah will not guide those who reject Faith.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those are they whose hearts, ears, and eyes Allah has sealed up, and they take no heed.</li><li class="collection-item"> Without doubt, in the Hereafter they will perish.</li><li class="collection-item"> But verily thy Lord,- to those who leave their homes after trials and persecutions,- and who thereafter strive and fight for the faith and patiently persevere,- Thy Lord, after all this is oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> One Day every soul will come up struggling for itself, and every soul will be recompensed (fully) for all its actions, and none will be unjustly dealt with.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah sets forth a Parable: a city enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place: Yet was it ungrateful for the favours of Allah: so Allah made it taste of hunger and terror (in extremes) (closing in on it) like a garment (from every side), because of the (evil) which (its people) wrought.</li><li class="collection-item"> And there came to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they falsely rejected him; so the Wrath seized them even in the midst of their iniquities.</li><li class="collection-item"> So eat of the sustenance which Allah has provided for you, lawful and good; and be grateful for the favours of Allah, if it is He Whom ye serve.</li><li class="collection-item"> He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and any (food) over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits,- then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> But say not - for any false thing that your tongues may put forth,- "This is lawful, and this is forbidden," so as to ascribe false things to Allah. For those who ascribe false things to Allah, will never prosper.</li><li class="collection-item"> (In such falsehood) is but a paltry profit; but they will have a most grievous Penalty.</li><li class="collection-item"> To the Jews We prohibited such things as We have mentioned to thee before: We did them no wrong, but they were used to doing wrong to themselves.</li><li class="collection-item"> But verily thy Lord,- to those who do wrong in ignorance, but who thereafter repent and make amends,- thy Lord, after all this, is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> Abraham was indeed a model, devoutly obedient to Allah, (and) true in Faith, and he joined not gods with Allah:</li><li class="collection-item"> He showed his gratitude for the favours of Allah, who chose him, and guided him to a Straight Way.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We gave him Good in this world, and he will be, in the Hereafter, in the ranks of the Righteous.</li><li class="collection-item"> So We have taught thee the inspired (Message), "Follow the ways of Abraham the True in Faith, and he joined not gods with Allah."</li><li class="collection-item"> The Sabbath was only made (strict) for those who disagreed (as to its observance); But Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment, as to their differences.</li><li class="collection-item"> Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: for thy Lord knoweth best, who have strayed from His Path, and who receive guidance.</li><li class="collection-item"> And if ye do catch them out, catch them out no worse than they catch you out: But if ye show patience, that is indeed the best (course) for those who are patient.</li><li class="collection-item"> And do thou be patient, for thy patience is but from Allah; nor grieve over them: and distress not thyself because of their plots.</li><li class="collection-item"> For Allah is with those who restrain themselves, and those who do good.</li>

<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>The name, An-Nahl, of this Surah has been taken 
from v. 68. This is merely to distinguish it from other Surahs.<br><br><strong>
Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>The following internal evidence shows that 
this Surah was revealed during the last Makkan stage of Prophethood:<br><br>v. 
41 clearly shows that persecution had forced some Muslims to emigrate to Habash 
before the revelation of this Surah.<br><br>It is evident from v. 106 that at 
that time the persecution of the Muslims was at its height. Therefore a problem 
had arisen in regard to the utterance of a blasphemous word, without actual 
disbelief, under unbearable conditions. The problem was that if one did so how 
he should be treated.<br><br>vv. 112-114 clearly refer to the end of seven year 
famine that had struck Makkah some years after the appointment of the Holy 
Prophet as Allah's Messenger.<br><br>There is a reference to v. 116 of this 
Surah in VI: 145, and v. 118 of this Surah contains a reference to VI: 146. This 
is a proof that both these Surahs (VI and XVI) were sent down in the same 
period.<br><br>The general style of the Surah also supports the view that this 
was revealed during the last stage at Makkah.<br><br><strong>Central Theme</strong><br>
<br>All the topics of the Surah revolve round different aspects of the Message, 
ie., refutation of shirk, proof of Tauhid, and warning of the consequences of 
the rejection of and opposition and antagonism to the Message.<br><br><strong>
Topics of Discussion</strong><br><br>The very first verse gives direct and 
strict warning to those who were rejecting the Message outright, as if to say, 
"Allah's decision has already been made concerning your rejection of the 
Message. Why are you then clamoring for hastening it? Why don't you make use of 
the respite that is being given to you!" And this was exactly what the 
disbelievers of Makkah needed at the time of the revelation of this Surah. For 
they challenged the Holy Prophet over and over again: "Why don't you bring that 
scourge with which you have been threatening us! For we have not only rejected 
your Message but have been openly opposing it for a long time." Such a challenge 
had become a by-word with them, which they frequently repeated as a clear proof 
that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was not a true Prophet.<br><br>
Immediately after this warning they have been admonished to give up shirk, for 
this false creed was the main obstacle in the way of the Message. Then the 
following topics come over and over again, one after the other:<br><br>Very 
convincing proofs of Tauhid and refutation of shirk have been based on the plain 
signs in the universe and in man's own self.<br><br>The objections of the 
disbelievers have been answered, their arguments refuted, their doubts removed 
and their false pretexts exposed.<br><br>Warnings have given of the consequences 
of persistence in false ways and antagonism to the Message.<br><br>The moral 
changes which the Message of the Holy Prophet aims to bring practically in human 
life have been presented briefly in an appealing manner. The mushriks have been 
told that belief in Allah, which they also professed, demanded that it should 
not be confined merely to lip service, but this creed should take a definite 
shape in moral and practical life.<br><br>The Holy Prophet and his companions 
have been comforted and told about the attitude they should adopt in the face of 
antagonism and persecution by the disbelievers.</p>
<hr>
<p>1That is, "The time for final `Judgment' has come near." As regards the use 
of the past tense in the original, this may be to show certainty of its 
occurrence in the near future or to emphasize the fact that the rebellion and 
the wrong deeds of the Quraish had become so unbearable that they warranted that 
the time for decisive action had come.<br><br>Here question arises as to what 
that "Judgment" was and how it came. We are of the opinion (and true knowledge 
is with Allah alone) that that "Judgment" was Hijrat (the Migration) of the Holy 
Prophet from Makkah. For a short time after this Revelation he was bidden to 
emigrate from there. And according to the Qur'an, a Prophet is bidden to leave 
his place only at that time when the rebellion and antagonism of his people 
reaches the extreme limit. Then their doom is sealed, for after this Allah's 
punishment comes on them either as a direct scourge from Him, or they are 
destroyed by the Prophet and his followers. And this did take place actually. At 
the occasion of the Migration, the people of Makkah regarded it as a victory for 
themselves, but in fact it turned out to be a defeat for shirk and disbelief 
which were totally uprooted within a decade or so after the Migration not only 
from Makkah but from the rest of Arabia as well. <br><br>2In order to understand 
the interconnection between the first and the second sentences, one should keep 
in view the background. The challenge of the disbelievers to the Prophet, `to 
hasten Divine Judgment',was really based on their assumption that their own 
religion of shirk was true and the religion of Tauhid presented by Muhammad 
(Allah's peace be on him) was false; otherwise, they argued, the Divine scourge 
with which he threatened them would have come upon them long before because of 
their disbelief and rebellion, if there had been the authority of Allah behind 
it. That is why after the declaration of the "Judgment," their misunderstanding 
about the cause of delay in the punishment was removed, as if to say, "You arc 
absolutely wrong to assume that punishment has not been inflicted on you because 
your creed of shirk is true, for Allah is fret from and far above shirk and has 
no partner."<br><br>3This means "the Spirit of Prophethood with which a Prophet 
is imbued in order to fulfill his Mission by word and deed. The Qur'an has 
called this the Spirit in several places, for this has the same relation to the 
Mission of a Prophet and his moral life, which the soul has to the physical 
human life."<br><br>4As one of the things, which prompted the disbelievers to 
challenge the Holy Prophet for scourge, was their presumption that he was not a 
true Prophet, Allah told them categorically that he was a true Prophet, who had 
been imbued with the "Spirit" which We Ourself had sent down on him.<br><br>
"Allah sends down the Spirit on..... He chooses." This is the answer to the 
objections which the chiefs of the Quraish used to raise against the Holy 
Prophet: Had Allah wanted to send a Messenger to them, was there no one better 
than Muhammad (Allah's peace be on him), son of `Abdullah, for this mission? Why 
did He not choose one of the big chiefs of Makkah or Taif for the purpose? Such 
absurd objections needed no other answer than this that is why such an answer 
has been given in several places of the Qur'an as if to say "Allah knows best 
how to do His work, and does not stand in need of any advice from you. He 
chooses for His mission anyone whom He considers fit for it.<br><br>5This verse 
declares the essence of the "Spirit" of Prophethood, which is this: Godhead 
belongs to one Allah alone: so only He is worthy of fear. Therefore, there is no 
other anchor that might make fast and hold together human moral system than His 
fear. For it is the fear of His displeasure and His punishment, and the fear of 
the consequences of His disobedience which alone can act as a strong deterrent 
to restrain one from deviation. That is why mankind has been admonished: "Fear 
Me."<br><br>6That is to say, "The whole system of the Earth and the heavens is a 
witness to the truth of the doctrine of Tauhid and to the negation of shirk. You 
may look at anything in the universe and consider the system from any point of 
view you like, you will find proof of this fact that it is being run by one God 
and not by many gods. Then how is it that you believe in shirk when there is no 
proof whatsoever of this in the universe?<br><br>As a fitting sequence of this, 
proofs of Tauhid and refutation of shirk have been given from Man himself and 
from other signs in the universe, and it has also been shown that Prophethood is 
based on Truth.<br><br>7This has two meanings and both are meant here.<br><br>
(1) Though Allah created man from an insignificant sperm-drop, he is capable of 
arguing and giving reasons in support of his claim.<br><br>(2) Man who has such 
an insignificant origin, has become so vain that he does not hesitate to dispute 
even with his Creator.<br><br>If considered in its first sense, it is a chain in 
the series of arguments given in many succeeding verses to prove the truth of 
the Message of the Holy Prophet. (Please refer to E.N. 15). If taken in the 
second sense, it is meant to warn man that he should not forget the 
insignificant origin of his existence while engaged in his rebellious arguments 
against his Creator. If he remembered the different stages of his humiliating 
birth and growth, he would consider many times before he assumed a haughty and 
rebellious attitude towards his Creator.<br><br>8That is, "There are many 
agencies which are working for the good of man but he is quite unaware of such 
servants and the services rendered by them."<br><br>9This contains an argument 
for Prophethood along with a proof of Tauhid and of Allah's Compassion and 
Providence. The argument is this:<br><br>There are many divergent ways of 
thought and action open for man to choose from. Obviously all these divergent 
ways cannot be straight ways, because there can be only one straight way; 
therefore, there can be only one right theory of life which is based on that 
way, and only one right way of life which is based on that right theory . Thus 
it is clear that the choice of the right way of life is man's most important and 
basic need, for its wrong choice would inevitably lead to his ruin. This is 
because all other things fulfill his animal needs only, but this is the greatest 
necessity of his life as a human being and without its fulfillment his life 
would be an utter failure.<br><br>Now, it cannot be expected that Allah Who made 
so many provisions, and on such a large scale, for the fulfillment of the animal 
life of man, did not make any arrangement for the fulfillment of this real and 
greatest necessity of man. Just as He has provided for all the necessities of 
his life, so He has also provided for this greatest need of his through 
Prophethood. If Prophethood is denied then it should be pointed out in what way 
Allah has fulfilled this basic need of man. Experience of centuries has shown 
that mankind has always blundered whenever it. has chosen a way of life by 
itself. This is because Man's wisdom and intelligence are limited, and he cannot 
depend on these for the choice of the right way of life. Above all, one cannot 
say that Allah has made no arrangement for this basic need of man, for this will 
be the greatest misconception of Allah that He may make most elaborate 
arrangements for man's animal life but should leave him in the lurch to search 
out a way for himself for the fulfillment of this most important and basic need.<br>
<br>10Here a question arises: "Why didn't Allah will to guide all the people 
aright inherently when He had taken upon Himself to show the Right Way ?" It is 
true that Allah could have imbued Man, like other creatures, with the inborn 
instinct and enabled him to choose the Right Way without conscious thought, 
experience or teaching. But this would have been against His will which was to 
create a being, having will and power and freedom to follow the Right Way or the 
wrong way, whichever he chose for himself. This is why he has been endowed with 
different means of knowledge and powers of conscious thought, deliberation and 
will, and has been empowered with the authority to make use of all powers in him 
and all things around him. Moreover, He has placed in him and all around him 
such factors as might lead him to guidance or deviation. All these things would 
have become meaningless, had he been created righteous by birth, and he could 
never have attained the heights of progress, which can be achieved only by the 
right use of freedom. That is why Allah has chosen Prophethood for Man's 
guidance, and left him free to follow or reject a Prophet. This is a test by 
means of which Allah judges whether Man accepts the guidance that is presented 
to him in a rational way."<br><br>11That is, "try to get your sustenance in 
lawful ways."<br><br>12This shows that the real function of mountains is to 
regulate the motion and speed of the Earth. We have come to this conclusion, for 
the Qur'an has made this benefit of mountains very prominent in many places. 
Therefore, their other benefits should be regarded as incidental.<br><br>
13Natural ways are those routes which are formed along the banks of streams, 
ravines and rivers. Though the importance of these ways is great even in the 
plains, one feels their sore need, especially in the mountainous regions.<br>
<br>14This is a Sign of Allah that He has broken the monotony of land by placing 
conspicuous landmarks on it to distinguish different regions from one another. 
These have many benefits and one of these is to help guide travelers and 
navigators to their destinations. One also realizes the importance and value of 
these landmarks, when one is traveling through a sandy desert where there are 
hardly any objects to guide on the way, and one is liable to lose the way any 
time. One feels the lack of landmarks much more in the sea voyage. It is in the 
deserts and the seas that people realize the true significance of "......by 
stars, too, they arc directed aright to their destinations."<br><br>This verse 
contains arguments for Tauhid. Providence, and Compassion of Allah, and also a 
proof of Prophethood. For the mind is instinctively turned towards this 
question: Can it be possible that Allah who has made so elaborate arrangements 
for man's guidance to fulfill his physical needs has neglected to provide for 
his moral and spiritual needs?" It cannot be so, for it is obvious that even the 
greatest loss of some physical necessity due to the adoption of a wrong way is 
nothing as compared with the loss of spiritual and moral values due to deviation 
froth the Right Way. It would be nothing less than having doubt in Allah's 
Compassion and Providence to think that He, Who had made so elaborate provision 
for man's guidance on land and sea by creating mountains, rivers, stars and 
other objects, would have neglected to make provision for his moral and 
spiritual guidance; any, it stands to reason, that He must have provided 
prominent beacons of light to guide Man to that Right Way of life which is 
indispensable to his true success.<br><br>15In vv. 4-16, some Signs have been 
mentioned in succession in order to focus people's attention on the Creation of 
man himself and of the Earth and the. heavens. They will thus find that 
everything supports the truth of the doctrines taught by the Holy Prophet. A 
critical study of all these Signs shows that these must have been designed and 
created by an All-Wise Being, and One Being alone, and there could not have been 
any partner or associate to help Him. Let us consider this theme from the point 
of view of Man, the central figure in the Creation. This wonderful being who is 
able to speak with his tongue and is capable of arguing his case with it, has 
been created from an insignificant sperm - drop. Then many animals have been 
created to satisfy the necessities of his life. They provide food, clothing and 
conveyance for him and help satisfy his aesthetic taste as well. Then there is a 
remarkable system of rain water from the sky to produce corn crops, fruits and 
verdure, etc., on the earth to fulfill man's needs. Then there is the creation 
of regular days and nights and seasons, which are closely connected with all 
kinds of production of the earth, and also with Man's general well being. Then 
there are oceans, which help fulfill many of his physical and aesthetic demands 
and provide water ways for traffic. Likewise mountains have been created to 
provide man with many benefits. Then there are landmarks on the earth and stars 
in the heavens to guide travelers and navigators to the destinations. In short, 
there are innumerable Signs in the Earth and the heavens which are closely 
interconnected and are also indispensable to man's welfare, nay, to his very 
existence. All these arc clear proofs that only One Being has designed the whole 
universe and created it in accordance with that design. It is He Who is all the 
time creating new things to fit in that scheme, and working this wonderful 
universe that spreads from the Earth to boundless heavens. Who can then claim, 
except a foolish or obdurate person, that all this has come into existence by a 
mere accident? Or, who can say that these different aspects, which are working 
under a perfect system and are intimately connected with one another and are 
well balanced, have been created by different gods and are under the control of 
different guardians? <br><br>16That is, "If you, people of Makkah, acknowledge 
(and they acknowledged this just as other mushriks did) that Allah alone is the 
Creator of all of you and everything, and no one of the partners, you have set 
up with Him, has created anything in the universe, how is it, then, that you 
ascribe to the created, a status equal to or like that of the Creator in the 
system of universe created by Him? How can it be possible that the powers and 
the rights of the created should be equal to the powers and the rights of the 
Creator in the universe created by Himself? How can it be believed that the 
Creator and the created possess the same qualities and characteristics, or can 
have such relationship as of father and son?"<br><br>17Here the connection of 
Allah's attributes, "Forgiving and Compassionate" , with the preceding verse is 
so obvious that it has been left unmentioned. It is this: "Though Allah goes on 
showering countless blessings upon people, they behave in an ungrateful, 
faithless and rebellious manner towards Him. He does not punish them 
immediately, but gives them respite, for He is Forgiving and Compassionate" . 
This is true of both individuals and communities. There are people, who deny 
even the existence of God, yet He goes on bestowing His favors on them for years 
on end. There are others who set up partners with Him in his attributes, powers 
and rights, and show their gratitude to others than Him for His blessings, yet 
He does not withhold His favors from them; there are still others who profess to 
acknowledge Him as their Creator and Benefactor, yet rebel against Him and are 
disobedient to Him and consider freedom from Him w be their birth right, but in 
spite of all this He continues to shower His countless blessings on them as long 
as they live. <br><br>18A grave misunderstanding might arise as to why Allah's 
blessings should continue to be showered even on those who deny Him and set up 
partners with Him and are disobedient to Him. The foolish people are liable to 
conclude from this that He does not withhold His favors from such people because 
He has no knowledge of their wicked deeds, The Qur'an declares: "......Even 
though He has full knowledge of all the deeds of the people, whether these are 
done secretly or openly, He does not discontinue His blessings on the sinners, 
for He is Forgiving, Compassionate and Merciful. Therefore, O foolish people! , 
get rid of this misunderstanding, and reform yourselves."<br><br>19The words 
employed here to refute man-made deifies clearly indicate that these deities 
were deceased prophets, saints, martyrs and pious and other extraordinary beings 
buried in their graves and not angels, jinns, devils or idols. For the angels 
and devils are alive: therefore, the words, "They are dead, not living" cannot 
apply to them, and it is out of the question to say about idols of stone or wood 
that "They do not know at all when they shall again be raised to life" in the 
Hereafter. As regards the objection to this version that there were no such 
deities in Arabia, this is based on the lack of knowledge of the history of the 
pre-Islamic period. It is well known that there was a large number of Jews and 
Christians living among many clans of Arabia, who used to invoke and worship 
their Prophets, saints, etc. It is also a fact that many gods of the mushriks of 
Arabia were human beings, whose idols they had set up for worship after their 
death. According to a Tradition cited in Bukhari on the authority of Ibn ' 
Abbas, "Wadd, Sua`, Yaghuth, Ya`uq, and Nasr were pious human beings, whom the 
succeeding generations had made gods." In another Tradition, related by Hadrat 'A'ishah, 
Asaf and Na'ilah were human beings. There are also traditions to the same effect 
about Lat, Munat and 'Uzza. So much so that according to some traditions of the 
mushriks, Lat and `Uzza were the beloved ones of Allah who used to pass His 
winter with Lat and summer with `Uzza. But "Allah is absolutely free from such 
(absurd) things they attribute to Him."<br><br>20That is, "Those who do not 
believe in the life in the Hereafter, have become so irresponsible, care-free 
and intoxicated with the life of this world, that they feel no hesitation or 
pang in denying any reality, and they put no value on or attach no worth to 
truth. That -is why, they are not prepared to impose any moral restraint on 
themselves and feel no need to investigate as to whether the way, they are 
following, is right or wrong.<br><br>21In the preceding verse (23) those puffed 
up people, who were rejecting the Message were warned that Allah had full 
knowledge of all their "deeds." Now from v. 24 the Qur'an takes up those "deeds" 
one by one and deals with the arguments they presented against the Messenger, 
the objections they raised and the lame excuses they invented for their 
rejection, and reproaches and admonishes them.<br><br>22One of their cunning 
devices was to create doubts about the Qur'an. Whenever outsiders came to visit 
Makkah, they would naturally make inquiries about the Qur'an, which the Holy 
Prophet declared, was being sent down to him by Allah. The disbelievers would 
answer that it contained merely fairy-tales of the ancients. They would say such 
things in order to create doubts in the minds of the inquirers so that they 
should not take any interest in the Message of the Holy Prophet.<br><br>23There 
is a gap between this answer and the preceding question which has been left for 
the reader to fill. When Allah will ask, "Now where are My partners?" there will 
be dead silence in the Plain where the whole of mankind shall have to gather on 
the occasion of Resurrection. The disbelievers and the mushriks will be 
dumb-founded for they will be at a loss to find an answer to this. Then those 
who had been given knowledge will make the assertion, "Today, there is 
............"<br><br>24This is Allah's addition to the previous assertion, and 
not its continuation. Those commentators who have wrongly considered this as 
continuation of the preceding sentence, are unable to offer any satisfactory 
explanation for their opinion.<br><br>25That is, "When the angels take 
possession of their souls at the time of death....."<br><br>26This verse (28) 
and verse 32, and several other verses in the Qur'an, clearly and definitely 
assert that immediately after death, souls suffer torment or enjoy peace in the 
world of Barzakh. The Traditions use the word "qabar" (grave) metaphorically for 
this existence of the souls. This is the world in which souls enter immediately 
after death and will remain therein up to the Day of Resurrection. Yet the 
disbelievers of the Traditions declare that after death souls will remain in a 
dormant state up to the time of Resurrection, and will neither feel any pain nor 
joy, nor will be conscious of anything at all. Obviously, this is a wrong 
opinion, for according to v. 28, just after death when the disbelievers will be 
conscious of the fact that they had been leading an evil life, they will try to 
make the angels believe that they had not done any evil deed. The angels will 
rebuke them at this "boldness" and will tell them that they shall have to go 
into Hell. On the other hand, according to verse 32, just after their death, the 
pious believers are welcomed by the angels and given the good news that they 
will enter into Paradise. Besides these verses, there is the mention of a 
dialogue between the angels and those Muslims, who did not migrate to Al-Madinah, 
after their souls were seized by the angels in IV: 97. Above all, according to 
XL: 45-46, the people of Pharaoh have been encircled by a torment and are 
exposed before the Fire of Hell every morning and every evening. This will go on 
up to the Day of Resurrection when they shall be sentenced to eternal torment.<br>
<br>In fact, both the Qur'an and the Traditions present the same kind of picture 
of the condition of the soul after death up to Resurrection. Death causes merely 
the separation of the soul from the body but does not annihilate it. The soul 
lives with the same personality that was formed by the different experiences and 
the mental exercises and moral activities it had in its worldly life in 
co-operation with the body. This nature of the consciousness, feelings, 
observations and experiences of the soul, during the waiting period, is similar 
to that, in a dream. Just as a criminal sentenced to death suffers from mental 
torture on the eve of his crucifixion, in the same way the angels take to task 
the guilty as in a dream, torture it and take it to the horrible Hell in order 
to make it fore-taste the impending torture. In contrast to this, the pure soul 
is welcomed by the angels and is given the good news of entry into paradise and 
is made to enjoy its pleasant breeze and smell, and to feel happy like the 
faithful servant who is invited to the headquarters to receive his reward. But 
this "life" in the world of Barzakh will suddenly come to an end on the second 
blowing of the Trumpet of Resurrection. When the guilty souls will again enter 
into their former bodies and muster in the Plain, they will cry in horror, "Oh! 
woe to us! who has roused us from our sleeping places ?" But the true Believers 
will say with perfect peace of mind, "This is exactly what the Beneficent had 
predicted, and the Messengers had told the truth." (XXXVI: 52).<br><br>This has 
been further elucidated in Chapter XXX.<br><br>As the guilty ones will be under 
the delusion that they had been lying in their death-bed for an hour or so and 
had been roused from given Knowledge and Faith, will say. "According to the 
Record of Allah, you have remained after death till this Day of Resurrection and 
this is the same Day of Resurrection, but you did not know this." (XXX: 55-56).<br>
<br>27In contrast to the disbelievers (v. 24), the righteous people spoke highly 
of the Holy Prophet and of the teachings of the Qur'an to the people coming from 
the suburbs of Makkah. Unlike the former they did not delude the people nor 
created misunderstandings in the minds. They were full of praise for them and 
told the truth about the Holy Prophet.<br><br>28This is the best blessing of 
Paradise. The dweller will get there whatever he will desire and wish and there 
will be nothing at all to offend him. This is the blessing that has never been 
attained even by the richest and the most powerful people in this world. On the 
contrary, every dweller of Paradise will enjoy this blessing to his fill because 
he will always have everything to his desire and liking, and will have each and 
every wish and desire fulfilled.<br><br>29This is to admonish the unbelievers to 
this effect: "Why are they still hesitating to accept the Message which is very 
simple and clear ? We have tried every method to present each aspect of the 
Truth clearly with arguments and brought witnesses thereof from the whole system 
of the universe, and have left no room for any man of understanding to stick to 
shirk. Now what they are waiting for is nothing more than this that the angel of 
death should come before them: and then they will accept the Message at the last 
moment of their lives. Or, do they wait for the scourge of God to overtake them 
and make them accept the Message?"<br><br>30In order to understand the 
significance of this argument the reader should keep in view vv. 148-150 and 
E.N.'s 124-126 of Chapter VI, for this has been cited and answered there. <br>
<br>31That is, "Your argument" is not a new one but the same old one which had 
always been offered by erroneous people who went before you. Today you arc, like 
them, excusing yourselves for your deviation and evil conduct, saying that it is 
the will of God. You know that this is a lame excuse that has been invented to 
delude yourselves, and to escape from admonition."<br><br>This answer also 
contains a subtle retort to the objection of the disbelievers that the Qur'an 
consisted merely of old stories of the ancients (v. 24). They meant to imply 
that the Prophet had nothing new to offer. So he was repeating the same old 
stories that had been repeated over and over again since the time of Prophet 
Noah. The retort is this: "If the Holy Prophet was not presenting anything new 
but was reciting the old stories of the ancients, you yourselves are not putting 
forward any new excuse in defense of your evil deeds, but the same old excuse 
that was put forward by the people who went before you."<br><br>32That is, "You 
are not justified in excusing yourselves for these sins, saying that it is the 
will of God for We sent Messengers to every ummat, who told the people in plain 
words that they should worship Us and none else, and should not follow and obey 
taghut. Besides this, We have already warned you that We do not approve of your 
deviations. Why should you then put forward this excuse for your deviations ? Do 
you mean to say that We ought to have sent such Messengers as would have forced 
you to follow the Right Way instead of bringing you to it by preaching?" (Please 
refer to E.N. 80 of Al-A am VI for the distinction between God's "will" and 
God's "approval. ")<br><br>33That is, Whenever a Messenger came to a people, 
they were divided into two groups:<br><br>(1) Those who accepted the Message 
(and that, too, could not have been possible except with the will of Allah. )<br>
<br>(2) Those who rejected it and stuck to their deviation. (For fuller 
explanation, please consult E.N. 28 of Al-An am VI.<br><br>34That is, "You can 
see for yourselves the lesson of human history. It is this that the people, who 
rejected the Message, incurred the scourge of Allah like Pharaoh and the people 
of Pharaoh, while Prophet Moses received the blessings of Allah."<br><br>35In v. 
39 those two things have been stated which rationally and morally require that 
there must be Resurrection and Life-after-death, that is: (1) to reveal what the 
reality was, and (2) to reward or punish people in accordance with the right or 
wrong stand they took about it in this world. It is common knowledge that since 
the creation of Man on the Earth there have been many differences regarding the 
Reality which have been sowing dissension between families, nations and races. 
These have also led to the formation of many different societies, cultures and 
creeds on different theories. In every age millions of the torch-bearers of each 
of these theories have been putting at stake their all-life, property, honor-to 
propagate and defend their favorite theory. Nay, there has always been such a 
bitter conflict between them that each group tried to annihilate the other, who, 
in his turn, stuck to it to the last. This being the case, common sense demands 
that such far-reaching and serious differences should be cleared some time or 
other, so as to decide with certainty what was right and what was wrong, who was 
in the right and who was in the wrong. Obviously, it is not possible to lift the 
curtain from the Reality in this world so as to reveal things in their true 
perspective. This is because the system on which this world has been created 
does not allow this. Therefore, there should be another world to fulfill this 
demand of common sense.<br><br>This is not the demand of common sense alone but 
also of the moral sense, which requires that the partners in this conflict 
should be rewarded or punished according to right or wrong, just or unjust part 
they played in it. For, some of these committed cruelties on the others, who had 
to make sacrifices for their cause. Then each one should also bear the 
responsibility for formulating and practicing a moral or immoral philosophy 
which influenced millions and billions of others for better or worse. Moral 
sense demands that there should be a time for the moral consequences to take 
their due course. As this is not possible in this world there should be another 
world for the purpose.<br><br>36This is the answer to those who imagined that it 
was the most difficult thing to raise the dead, and that, too, to raise together 
at once all the people who had died at any time. They have been told that it is 
an easy thing for Allah, Who has the power to bring into existence anything He 
desires, merely by His command, "Be," for He does not stand in need of any 
provisions, any means and any favorable environment for this. His mere Command 
produces necessary provisions, means and environment. This world was brought 
into existence by His mere Command, "Be," and likewise the Next world will at 
once come into existence by His single Command.<br><br>37This is to comfort the 
Muslim emigrants from Makkah to Habash, who were forced to leave their homes 
because of the unbearable persecution they suffered at the hands of the 
disbelievers. The change of the scene from the disbelievers to the emigrants to 
Habash contains a subtle warning to the disbelievers that they should not remain 
under any delusion that they would get off scot-free from punishment for their 
cruel behavior towards those Muslims, so as to say, "O cruel people! there shall 
be Resurrection to reward the oppressed Believers and to punish you for your 
persecution of them."<br><br>38This is the answer to the objection of the 
mushriks of Makkah (which has not been cited here j that they could not believe 
that Muhammad (may Allah's peace be upon him), was a Prophet of God, because he 
was a human being like them. They have been told that the same objection had 
been raised against all the Prophets who came before him.<br><br>39"....people 
who possess Admonition" are the scholars of the people of the Books and others, 
who, though not scholars in the strict sense had sufficient knowledge of the 
teachings of the revealed Books and were acquainted with the stories of the 
former Prophets.<br><br>40In this connection, it is worthwhile to note that this 
duty of making plain and explaining the teachings of the Book' was to be 
performed by Prophet not only by word of mouth but also practically. It was 
required that he should organize, under his own guidance, a Muslim Community and 
establish it in accordance with the principles of the Book. This duty of the 
Holy Prophet has been stated here especially to show the wisdom of sending a man 
as a Messenger, for, otherwise the Book could have been sent through the angels 
or could have been printed and sent directly to each man. But in this way; that 
purpose for which Allah in His Wisdom and Bounty and Providence designed to send 
the Book could not have been served. For, that purpose demanded that the Book 
should be Brought by a perfect man, who should present it piece by piece, 
explain its meaning, remove the difficulties and doubts, answer objections, etc. 
, and above all, he should show towards those who rejected and opposed it that 
kind of attitude which is worthy of the bearer of this Book. On the other hand, 
he should guide those who believed in it in every aspect of life and set before 
them his own excellent pattern of life. Then he should train them individually 
and collectively on the principles of the Book; so as to make them a model 
society for the rest of mankind.<br><br>Let us now consider this verse (43) from 
another point of view. Just as it cuts at the root of the argumentation of those 
who rejected the Creed that a human Prophet could bring the Book, in the same 
way, it repudiates the view of those who plead that the Book should be accepted 
without any exposition of it from the Prophet. This latter view is contradictory 
to this verse, whatever be the position taken by its exponents. They might 
either be of the opinion that (a) the Prophet did not give any explanation of 
the Book he presented or that (b) the only acceptable thing is the Book and not 
any "Exposition" thereof by the Prophet, or that (c) now the Book alone suffices 
us, for its "Exposition" by the Prophet has lost its utility or that (d) now the 
Book alone is authentic for the "Exposition" by the Prophet has ceased to exist, 
or if it does exists, it cannot be relied upon.<br><br>If they take the position 
(a), it will mean that the Prophet did not fulfill the purpose for which he was 
chosen to be the bearer of the Book: otherwise Allah could send it through an 
angel or directly to each person.<br><br>If they take the position (b) or (c), 
(God forbid) they will be accusing Allah of doing a useless thing by sending His 
Book through a Prophet, when He could have printed copies of the Qur'an and sent 
those directly to the people.<br><br>In case, they take the position (d), they, 
in fact, repudiate both the Qur'an and its "Exposition by the Holy Prophet. Then 
the only rational course left for them would be to accept the view of those who 
believe in the necessity of a new Prophet and a new revelation; whereas Allah 
Himself considers the "Exposition" of the Book by the Prophet as an essential 
thing, and puts it forward as an argument for the necessity of a Prophet. Now if 
the view of the rejectors of Tradition that the Explanation of the Holy Prophet 
has disappeared from the world is to be accepted, then two conclusions are 
inevitable; First, the Prophethood of Muhammad (May Allah's peace be upon him) 
as a pattern for us has ceased to exist, and the only relation we have with him 
is the same that we have with the other former Prophets, e.g. Hud, Salih, 
Shu`aib, etc. (May Allah's peace be upon them). That is, we have only to testify 
that they were Prophets but we have no obligation to follow their patterns, for 
we have none with us. This position obviously leads to the need of a new 
Prophet, for it automatically refutes the doctrine of the Finality of 
Prophethood. The second inevitable conclusion will be that a new Book is needed 
because in that case the Qur'an alone could not, according to its author, 
suffice. Thus in the face of this verse, there is no argument left to prove that 
the Qur'an is self-sufficient to explain itself, for it itself says that there 
is no need of a Prophet to explain it. Thus it is absolutely necessary that a 
new Book must be sent down. May Allah destroy such people ! In their enthusiasm 
to repudiate Tradition, they are really cutting at the very root of Islam 
itself.<br><br>41The argument is this: The fact that everything-a man, an 
animal, a tree or a mountain-casts its shadow, is a clear proof of its material 
nature, and everything which is made of matter, is a creation of Allah and is 
subject to a universal law. In this case the law is that every material thing 
casts its shadow, which is symbolical of its servitude, and it cannot have any 
share whatsoever in Godhead.<br><br>42That is, "Not only all things on the earth 
alone but also all things in the heavens, including all those whom people have 
been regarding as gods and goddesses. and considering to be closely related to 
Allah arc subservient to God, and have no share whatsoever in His Godhead."<br>
<br>Incidentally, it implies the existence of living creatures not only on the 
earth but in the planets, too.<br><br>43Negation of two gods by itself negates 
the existence of more than two gods.<br><br>44In other words it means that the 
whole system of the universe exists on its obedience to Him.<br><br>45That is, 
"When it is so, will you then make the fear of any other than God the basis of 
the system of your life?"<br><br>46That is, "The fact, that you run to Allah for 
help in your distress and not to anyone else, is a clear proof of the Oneness of 
Allah, which has been embedded in your own hearts. At the time of your 
affliction, your true nature, which had been suppressed by the gods you had 
forged, involuntarily comes to the surface and invokes Allah, for it knows no 
other god or lord or master, having any real power. (For further details please 
refer to E.N.'s 29 and 41 of Chapter VI).<br><br>47That is, "At the time of 
showing gratitude to Allah for removing his affliction, he begins to make 
offerings also to some god, goddess or saint to show that Allah's kindness to 
him was due to the intercession of his patron, for he imagines that otherwise 
Allah would not have removed his distress.<br><br>48They assign shares to those 
patrons about whom they have no authentic knowledge that God has made them His 
partners and allotted some duties of Godhead to them and made them governors of 
some territories in His Kingdom.<br><br>49That is, "They set apart a portion of 
their incomes and land products to make offerings of this to their patron."<br>
<br>50This refers to a tradition of the ancient Arabs. They regarded their 
goddesses and angels as daughters of God.<br><br>51That is, "sons."<br><br>
52This attitude of contempt towards daughters has been mentioned to bring home 
to them the height of their folly, ignorance and impudence in regard to God. 
This is why they did not hesitate to assign daughters to Allah, though they 
themselves felt that to have daughters was a matter of disgrace for theta. 
Besides this, it shows that they had a very low estimation of Allah, which had 
resulted from their ways of shirk. So they felt nothing wrong in ascribing such 
foolish and absurd things to Allah Who is above such things.<br><br>53That is, 
"This Book has afforded them an excellent opportunity to resolve their 
differences which have been caused by the superstitious creeds of their 
forefathers, and which have divided, them into warring factions. They can then 
unite on the permanent basis of the Truth presented by the Qur'an, but those 
foolish people preferring their former condition even after the coming of this 
blessing, shall meet with disgrace and torment. On the other hand, only those, 
who believe in this Book, will find the Right Way and blessed with mercy and 
favors from Allah.”<br><br>53aThat is, " Had you listened to the Message of the 
Prophet, and observed those Signs carefully, you would have cried from the core 
of your heart, 'These Signs support his Message' . Year after year you witness 
these Signs. There is the land, all barren before you, without any sign of 
life-no blade of grass, no bud or flower, and no insect. Then comes rain. All of 
a sudden, the same land is covered with life. There crop upon numerous kinds of 
insects of which no vestige had been left. You witness this process of life and 
death, and death and life, repeated year after year. Yet you doubt this when the 
Prophet tells you that Allah will again bring to life all human beings after 
their death. This is because you see these Signs as animals do, who do not see 
the wisdom of the Creator underlying this phenomenon; otherwise you would have 
discovered that these signs support the Message of the Prophet."<br><br>
54"....between filth and blood......":This refers to the most wonderful process 
of the formation of pure milk in the bellies of the she-cattle, for, the fodder 
they eat turns into blood, filth and pure milk, which is altogether different 
from the first two in its nature, color and usefulness. Some she-cattle produce 
milk in such abundance that after suckling their young-ones a large quantity of 
it is left to make excellent human food.<br><br>55Incidentally it implies that 
the juice of the fruits of date-palms and vines contains two things. One is that 
which is pure and wholesome food for man and the other is that which turns into 
alcohol after it becomes rotten. But it has been left to the choice of man to 
obtain pure healthy food from this providence or to drink it as intoxicant wine 
to excite him and make him lose his self-control. This also contains a hint as 
to the prohibition of wine.<br><br>56The lexical meaning of the Arabic word ('wahi 
) is secret inspiration which is felt only by the one who inspires and the other 
who is inspired with. The Qur'an has used this word both for the instinctive 
inspiration by Allah to His creation in general and for the Revelation towards 
His Prophets in particular. Allah sends His "wahi " to the heavens with His 
Command and they begin functioning in accordance with it (XL: 12). He will send 
this to the Earth with His Command and it will relate the story of all that had 
happened on and in it. (XCIX: 4-S). He sends wahi to the bee and inspires it 
with faculties to perform the whole of its wonderful work instinctively (v. 68). 
The same is true of the bird that learns to fly, the fish that learns to swim, 
the newly born child that learns to suck milk, etc., etc. Then, it is also wahi 
with which Allah inspires a human being with a spontaneous idea (XXVIII: 7). The 
same is the case with all the great discoveries, inventions, works of literature 
and art, etc. , which would not have been possible without the benefit of wahi. 
As a matter of fact, every human being at one time or the other feels its mental 
or spiritual influence in the form of an idea or thought or plan or dream, which 
is confirmed by a subsequent experience to be the right guidance from the unseen 
wahi.<br><br>Then there is the wahi (Revelation) which is the privilege of the 
Prophets. This form of wahi has its own special features and is quite distinct 
from all' its other forms. The Prophet, who is inspired with it, is fully 
conscious and has his firm conviction that it is being sent down from Allah. 
Such a Revelation contains doctrines of creed, commandments, laws, regulations 
and instructions for the guidance of mankind. <br><br>57" . . . . follow the 
ways made smooth by thy Lord" : ". . . . . work in accordance with the methods 
which have been taught to thee by Allah's wahi for the smooth running of hive 
life" . It is Allah's wahi (instinctive inspiration) that has taught the bees 
how to build their wonderful factory with separate combs to rear brood, combs to 
turn nectar into honey, combs to store food, in short, separate combs to fulfill 
every aspect of hive life. It is wahi that has taught the bees how to organize 
themselves into a co-operative society for collective effort to run the 
"factory" with the queen and thousands of workers to perform a variety of 
specific tasks. All these things have been made so smooth for them by wahi that 
the bees never feel the necessity of ever thinking about it. They have been 
running smoothly their factory with their collective effort for thousands of 
years with perfect accuracy. <br><br>58Though honey is a wholesome food with a 
sweet taste and has medicinal power as well, its latter quality has been 
mentioned only because the former is too obvious. It is used as a medicine to 
cure several diseases because it contains the juice and glucose of flowers and 
fruits in the best form. Besides this, it is also used in preparing and 
preserving other medicines because it does not rot. It also preserves other 
things from decay. That is why it has been used for centuries as a substitute 
for alcohol. And if the bee-hive is built at a place, which abounds in certain 
medicinal herbs, its honey does not remain mere honey, but becomes also the 
essence of that herb. It is expected that if bees are used methodically for 
extracting essence from herbs, etc. , that essence will prove to be much better 
than the one obtained in the laboratories. <br><br>59This passage (vv. 48-69) 
contains proofs of Tauhid and Life-after death. These were necessitated, for the 
disbelievers and .he mushriks were bitterly opposed to the Holy Prophet mainly 
because of these two doctrines. The acceptance of the first doctrine demolished 
the whole system of life based on shirk or atheism because to acknowledge Allah 
to be the sole Providence, the Helper and the protector left no room for the 
worship of any god or goddess. The proof of Tauhid is based on the observance of 
the structure of the cattle, the bees, the date-palms and vine-yards and their 
usefulness to mankind. Naturally the question arises: Who has designed these in 
the manner and for the purpose they have been created? The only obvious answer 
is that it is the All-Wise and All-Beneficent Allah Who has designed all these 
things for the benefit of mankind to produce such varieties of food that are so 
wholesome and so tasty. The Prophet, therefore, rightly demanded, "When you 
yourselves admit, and you cannot but admit, that it is Allah alone Who has 
provided milk, honey, dates, grapes and the like, He and none but He is worthy 
of your worship, praise, gratitude and allegiance. Why do you then insist on 
making offerings to your self-made gods and goddesses?"<br><br>The second 
doctrine to which the disbelievers took strong objection was that there is 
surely the Life-after-death. They were against this doctrine for its acceptance 
changed the whole moral system and they were not prepared to change their 
immoral ways. Their objection was based on the presumption that it was 
impossible to bring to life anyone after death.<br><br>They have been asked to 
observe that the barren land, which once had been covered with vegetable life, 
was again covered with it after rainfall and they have been watching such 
repetition of life year after year. That Allah, Who could so easily bring to 
life the dead vegetable, could do the same and bring to life all the dead 
without any difficulty at all.<br><br>60It is to emphasize this: Allah not only 
provides you with the necessities and good things of life (as stated in the 
preceding verses), but also has full power over your life and death. None else 
has any power to give lift or cause death.<br><br>61This fact has been mentioned 
to bring home to the disbelievers and the mushriks that knowledge, which gives 
superiority to man over all creatures on this Earth, has been given by Allah, as 
if to say, "You yourselves have seen that when a man, who once possessed much 
knowledge, becomes very old, he is reduced to a mere lump of flesh. Then that 
man who once taught knowledge to others loses all his senses and cannot look 
even after his own self."<br><br>62It will be worthwhile to give deep thought to 
the meanings of this verse, for some modern commentators of the Qur'an have 
founded strange economic theories and systems on it. Their interpretation is an 
instance of perverting the meaning of the Qur'an by isolating verses from their 
context and treating it as a separate whole in order to formulate a new 
philosophy and law of Islamic Economics. In their opinion the verse implies 
this: Those people to whom Allah has given more provisions than others, should 
share these equally with their servants and slaves: otherwise they shall be 
guilty of ingratitude to Allah in regard to the wealth with which He had blessed 
them. This commentary on the verse is obviously wrong and far-fetched because in 
the context it occurs there is no mention at all of any law of economics. The 
whole passage in which this verse occurs deals with the refutation of shirk and 
proof of Tauhid. The same themes are continued in the subsequent verses. There 
seems to be no reason why an economic law should have been inserted here, which 
would have been absolutely irrelevant, to say the least. On the contrary, when 
the verse is considered in its context, it becomes quite obvious that it is no 
more than the statement of a fact to prove the same theme that is contained in 
this passage. It argues like this: "When you yourselves do not make your 
servants and slaves equal partners in your wealth-which in fact is given to you 
by Allah-how is it that you join other gods with God in your gratitude to Him 
for the favors with which He has blessed you. You know that these gods have no 
powers to bestow anything on anyone, and, therefore, have no right in your 
worship of Allah, for they are after all His slaves and servants."<br><br>This 
interpretation of the verse under discussion is corroborated by XXX: 28: "Allah 
sets forth to you an instance from your own selves: Do your slaves share with 
you the wealth We have bestowed on you so that you and they become equals in 
this? And do you fear them as you fear one another? Thus We make clear Our Signs 
to those who use their common sense." A comparison of the two verses makes it 
quite clear that these have been cited to bring home to the mushriks that they 
themselves do not associate their slaves with themselves in their wealth and 
status, but they have the impudence and folly to set up His own creature as 
partner with God.<br><br>It appears that the erroneous interpretation has been 
strengthened by the succeeding sentence: "What! do they then deny to acknowledge 
Allah's favor? As this sentence immediately follows the similitude of the rich 
people and their slaves, they conclude that it will be ingratitude on the part 
of those, who possess more wealth not to share it equally with those who have 
less. As a matter of fact, everyone who has studied the Qur'an critically knows 
that ingratitude to Allah is to show gratitude to others than Allah for His 
blessings. This interpretation is so patently wrong that those who are 
well-versed in the teachings of the Qur'an can have no misconception about it. 
And such verses as these can mislead only those who have a cursory knowledge of 
the Qur'an.<br><br>Now that the significance of the ingratitude towards Allah's 
blessing has become plain, the meaning of the verse will be quite clear, and it 
is this: "When the Mushriks understand the implication of the difference between 
the master and his slave and observe this distinction in their own lives, why do 
they then persist in ignoring the immense difference between the Creator and His 
creatures and set up the latter as His partners and pay homage of gratitude to 
them for the blessings bestowed on them by Allah.<br><br>63" .... they believe 
in falsehood ......": they have this false and baseless belief that there are 
certain gods and goddesses, jinns and saints, dead and alive, who possess the 
power to make or mar their fates, fulfill their desires and answer their 
prayers, give them children, cure their diseases and help them win law suits.<br>
<br>64" .... they deny Allah's favors" by associating others with Allah in 
offering gratitude to Him for His favors, though they did not have any proof or 
authority that their false gods had played any part in regard to those favors. 
The Qur'an considers such an association to be the denial of Allah's favors. It 
puts forward the fundamental principle: It is the denial of the favor of the 
real benefactor to offer gratitude for his favor to anyone who has not done that 
favor, or to presume without any proof or reason that the real benefactor has 
nor granted that favor of his own accord but because of the mediation or regard 
or recommendation or intercession of this or that person.<br><br>Even a little 
thinking will show that both of the above-mentioned fundamental things are 
absolutely just and rational. Let us suppose, for the sake of illustration, that 
A, out of sympathy, helps B, a needy person, but at that very moment B stands up 
in A's presence, and offers gratitude for that kind act to another person who 
had no share at all in it. A being a generous person may not take any notice of 
B's absurd response, and may even continue to help him as before, but he cannot 
help having a very low opinion of B character and considering him to be an 
ungrateful wretch. Then on inquiry reveals that he was grateful to the other 
person for A had done that kindness to B because of him. Naturally A will take 
it ill, for he knows that B's assumption is absolutely wrong: nay, he will take 
this as an insult to himself because it meant that B has a very low opinion of 
him that he is not a generous and kind-hearted man but merely does such deeds to 
please his friends. It means that A helps a needy person only if he brings 
recommendation of his friends; otherwise none can expect any goodness from him.
<br><br>65"Make no comparisons with Allah" : You should not compare Allah with 
others nor consider Him to be unapproachable like worldly kings and rulers, to 
whom none can have access without the mediation and intercession of their 
courtiers and servants. As Allah is not surrounded by angels, saints, favorites, 
etc., everyone can have direct access to Him without mediation by anyone. <br>
<br>66In the preceding verse, the mushriks were told not to make comparisons 
between Allah and His creatures, for there is nothing like Him. As the bases of 
their comparison were wrong, their conclusions were also misleading. In this 
verse appropriate similitudes have been cited and right comparisons have been 
made to lead them to Reality.<br><br>67Between the last question and "May God be 
praised! " there is a gap which is to be filled with the help of the latter. 
When the question was posed, obviously the mushriks could not say that the two 
men were equal. So some of them would have admitted that they were not equal, 
while the others would have kept quiet for fear that in case of admission, they 
would have to abide by its logical conclusion, that is, the admission of 
refutation of the doctrine of shirk. Therefore, the words, "May God be praised 
!" have been put in the mouth of the Prophet in answer to both kinds of the 
response to the question. In the first case, it would mean: "May God be praised! 
you have admitted at least so much" . In the second case, it would mean: "May 
God be praised! you have kept quiet in spite of all your obduracy and have not 
had the audacity to say that both were equal."<br><br>68"...most people do not 
understand (this simple thing)" that while they feel and carefully observe the 
distinction between those who have powers and those who are powerless, they 
neither feel nor observe the clear distinction between the Creator and His 
creation. That is why they associate the creatures with the Creator in His 
Attributes and Powers and show the kind of allegiance to them as is the 
exclusive right of the Creator. The pity is that in their everyday life, they 
would beg for sane thing from the master of the house and not from the servants 
but in contrast to this, they would beg for their needs from the servants of 
Allah and not from Him.<br><br>69In the first similitude, distinction between 
Allah and false gods has been made clear in regard to the possession of powers 
and the lack of these. In the second one, the emphasis is on the use of those 
powers. Allah is not only All Powerful, but also hears all the prayers and 
fulfills all the needs, while the slave is utterly powerless. He does not and 
cannot hear prayers, nor can make a response to them nor has the power to do 
anything at all. He is totally dependent on the Master and quite incapable of 
doing anything by himself. On the other hand, the Master is All-Powerful and 
All-Wise. He enjoins justice on the world: whatever He does is right and 
accurate. Ask them, "Is it then a point of wisdom to regard such Master and such 
a slave as equal?"<br><br>70The subsequent sentence shows that this is the 
answer w a question which was frequently put to the Holy Prophet by the 
disbelievers of Makkah. The question which has not been cited was this: If the 
Resurrection you so often talk of is really coming, let us know the date of its 
coming.<br><br>71That is, "Don't be under the delusion that the Resurrection 
will come gradually and take a long time: you will neither be able to sec it 
coming at a distance nor guard against it and make preparations to meet it. For 
it will come suddenly without any previous notice, in the twinkling of an eye or 
even take less time than this. Therefore, now is the time to consider this 
matter seriously and to decide about your attitude towards it. You should not 
depend upon this false hope that there is still a long time in the coming of the 
Resurrection and you will set matters right with Allah when you will see it 
coming."<br><br>It may be pointed out that the Resurrection has been mentioned 
here during the discussion on Tauhid in order to warn the people that the choice 
between the doctrines of Tauhid and shirk is not merely a theoretical question. 
For that choice determines different courses of life for which they will be 
called to account on the Day of Resurrection. They have also been warned that it 
will come all of a sudden at some unknown time. Therefore, they should be very 
careful to make that choice which will determine their success or failure on 
that Day. <br><br>72This is to remind them that when they were born they were 
more helpless and ignorant than the young-one of an animal, but Allah gave them 
ears to hear, eyes to see and minds to think and reflect. These have enabled 
them to acquire every kind of information and knowledge to carry on their 
worldly affairs efficiently. So much so that these sensory faculties are the 
only means which help man attain so much progress as to rule over everything on 
the earth.<br><br>73That is, "You should be grateful to that Allah Who has 
bestowed upon you such blessings as these. It will be ingratitude on your part 
if you hear everything with your ears except the Word of God, and see everything 
with your eyes except the Signs of Allah and consider seriously about all the 
matters except your Benefactor Who has blessed you with these favors.<br><br>
74Houses: tents of skin which are in common use in Arabia.<br><br>75That is, 
"When you want to start on a journey, you can easily fold your tents and carry 
them, and when you want to make a short halt, you can easily unfold them and 
pitch them for shelter and rest."<br><br>76The Qur'an has not mentioned 
protection from cold for either of the two reasons: (1) Because the use of 
garments in the summer season is a symbol of cultural perfection and obviously 
there is no need to mention the lower stages of culture. Or (2) the use of 
garments in hot countries has specially been mentioned because the main use of 
garments there is for protection from the hot pestilential furious wind. 
Therefore, one has to cover one's head, neck, ears, and the whole of ones body 
to protect it from the hot wind which would otherwise scorch one to death.<br>
<br>77That is, "Armour."<br><br>78"He perfects His blessings on you": Allah 
makes provision for the minutest needs and necessities of every aspect of human 
life. For example, let us take the instance of the protection of the human body 
from external influences. We find that Allah has made such elaborate 
arrangements as require a complete book to relate them. These arrangements reach 
their perfection in the case of clothing and housing arrangement. Or, if we 
consider the food requirements we realize that it is of many varieties which 
fulfill every need. More than this: the means Allah has provided for food 
requirements of man are so numerous that the list of the varieties and the names 
of different kinds of food require a big volume. This is the perfection of the 
blessing of food. Likewise, one would see perfection of the blessings of Allah 
in the fulfillment of each and every human need and necessity.<br><br>79Here the 
denial of the blessings of Allah refers to practical denial by the disbelievers 
of Makkah. For they did not deny that all these blessings were from Allah but 
along with this they believed that their saints and gods also had contributed 
towards them. This is why they associated their intercessors in their gratitude 
to Allah for these blessings. Nay, they were even more grateful to them than to 
Allah. Allah regards this association as denial of His blessings, ingratitude 
and forgetfulness of His favors.<br><br>80The witness will be the Prophet of 
that community or his follower who invited that community to Tauhid and 
God-worship and warned it of the consequences of shirk and superstitious rites 
and customs and cautioned it against the accountability on the Day of 
Resurrection. He will bear witness of the fact that he had conveyed the true 
Message to those people, and that they committed evils deliberately and not in 
ignorance.<br><br>81This does not mean that the criminals will not be given any 
opportunity to clear themselves but it means that their crimes will be proved to 
the hilt by means of irrefutable evidence which will leave no room for excuses.
<br><br>82That is, "They will not be given the opportunity to beg pardon of 
their Lord for their crimes. For that will be the time of judgment as the time 
of begging pardon would have ended long before this." The Qur'an and the 
Traditions are explicit on this point that the place for penitence is this world 
and not the Next World. Even in this world the opportunity is lost as soon as 
signs of death begin to appear, for the penitence at that time will be of no 
avail when a person knows that the time of his death has come. Respite for deeds 
expires as soon as one enters into the boundary of death, and the only thing 
that remains after that is the award of reward and punishment.<br><br>83It does 
not mean that they would deny the fact that the mushriks used to invoke their 
help. They will call them liars in the sense that they had made them deities 
without their knowledge, information and permission, as if to say, "We never 
told you to leave Allah aside and pray to us for help. As a matter of fact, we 
never approved of this, nay, we were utterly unaware of this that you were 
invoking us. It was an utter lie that you considered us to be able to hear your 
prayers, answer them and help you out of your difficulties. As you yourselves 
were responsible for this shirk, why arc you involving us in its consequences?"<br>
<br>84That is, "All those things on which they had relied will prove to be 
false, for they will not find anyone to hear their supplication nor anyone to 
remove their hardships. Nay, there will be none who will come forward and say, 
"These. are my dependents: so no action should be taken against them."<br><br>
85Double torment: one for their own disbelief and the other for hindering others 
from the Way of Allah.<br><br>86The Qur'an makes manifest everything on which 
depends guidance or deviation, success or failure: whose knowledge is essential 
for following the Right Way: which clearly distinguishes Truth from false hood.<br>
<br>In this connection one should guard against that meaning of this sentence 
and the like in the Qur'an according to which some people interpret "everything" 
to mean "the knowledge of all sciences, arts, etc.," and in order to prove the 
correctness of their interpretation, they have to pervert the real meaning of 
the Qur'an. <br><br>87This Book is a guidance for those who surrender to it as a 
Divine Book and follow it in every aspect of life. Then it will bring Allah's 
blessings upon them, and will give them the good news that they will come out 
successful in the Court of Allah on the Day of Judgment. Or. the contrary, those 
people who reject it shall not only be deprived of guidance and blessing but 
will also find it as a testimony against themselves on the Day of Resurrection 
when Allah's Messenger will stand up to testify against them. This Book will 
prove to be a strong argument against them, for Allah's Messenger will say that 
he had conveyed its Message which made manifest the distinction between Truth 
and falsehood.<br><br>88In this brief sentence Allah has enjoined three most 
important things on which alone depends the establishment of a sound and healthy 
society:<br><br>The first of these is justice which has two aspects.<br><br>To 
make such arrangements as may enable everyone to get one's due rights without 
stint. Justice does not, however, mean equal distribution of rights, for that 
would be absolutely unnatural. In fact, justice means equitable dispensation of 
rights which in certain cases may mean equality. For example, all citizens 
should have equal rights of citizenship but in other cases equality in rights 
would be injustice. For instance, equality in social status and rights between 
parents and their children will obviously be wrong. Likewise those who render 
services of superior and inferior types cannot be equal in regard to wages and 
salaries. What Allah enjoins is that the full rights of everyone should be 
honestly rendered whether those be moral, social, economic legal or political in 
accordance with what one justly deserves.<br><br>The second thing enjoined is "ihsan" 
which has no equivalent in English. This means to be good, generous, 
sympathetic, tolerant, forgiving, polite, cooperative, selfless, etc. In 
collective life this is even more important than justice; for justice is the 
foundation of a sound society but ihsan is its perfection. On the one hand, 
justice protects society from bitterness and violation of rights: on the other, 
ihsan makes it sweet and joyful and worth living. It is obvious that no society 
can flourish if every individual insists on exacting his pound of flesh. At best 
such a society might be free from conflict but there cannot be love, gratitude, 
generosity, sacrifice, sincerity, sympathy and such humane qualities as produce 
sweetness in life and develop high values.<br><br>The third thing which has been 
enjoined is good treatment towards one's relatives which in fact is a specific 
form of ihsan. It means that one should not only treat one's relatives well, 
share their sorrows and pleasures and help them within lawful limits but should 
also share one's wealth with them according to one's means and the need of each 
relative. This enjoins on everyone who possesses ample means to acknowledge the 
share of one's deserving relatives along with the rights of one's own person and 
family. The Divine Law holds every well-to-do person in a family to be 
responsible for fulfilling the needs of all his needy kith and kin. The Law 
considers it a great evil that one person should enjoy the pleasures of life 
while his own kith and kin are starving. As it considers the family to be an 
important part of society, it lays down that the first right of needy 
individuals is on its well-to-do members and then on the others. Likewise it is 
the first duty of the well-to-do members of the family to fulfill the needs of 
their own near relatives and then those of others. The Holy Prophet has 
emphasized this fact in many Traditions, according to which a person owes rights 
to his parents, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters, other 
relatives, etc., in accordance with the nearness of their relationships. On the 
basis of this fundamental principle, Caliph Umar made it obligatory on the first 
cousins of an orphan to support him. In the case of another orphan he declared 
that if he had no first cousins he would have made it obligatory on distant 
cousins to support him. Just imagine the happy condition of the society every 
unit of which supports its every needy individual in this way-most surely that 
society will become high and pure economically, socially, and morally.<br><br>
89In contrast to the above-mentioned three virtues, Allah prohibits three vices 
which ruin individuals and the society as a whole:<br><br>(1) The Arabic word 
fahsha applies to all those things that are immodest, immoral or obscene or 
nasty or dirty or vulgar, not fit to be seen or heard, because they offend 
against recognized standards of propriety or good taste, e.g., adultery, 
fornication, homo-sexuality, nakedness, nudity, theft, robbery, drinking, 
gambling, begging, abusive language and the like. Likewise it is indecent to 
indulge in giving publicity to any of these evils and to spread them, e.g., 
false propaganda, calumny, publicity of crimes, indecent stories, dramas, films, 
naked pictures, public appearance of womenfolk with indecent make-ups, free 
mixing of sexes, dancing and the like.<br><br>(2) Munkar applies to all those 
evils which have always been universally regarded as evils and have been 
forbidden by all divine systems of law.<br><br>(3) Baghy applies to those vices 
that transgress the proper limits of decency and violate the rights of others, 
whether those of the Creator or His Creation. <br><br>90In this verse, Allah has 
enjoined three kinds of Covenants which have been mentioned in the order of 
their importance. The first of these Covenants is the one between man and his 
Allah which is the most important of all. The second in importance is the 
Covenant between one man or one group of men and another man or another group of 
men, which is taken with Allah as a witness or in which the name of God has been 
used. The third Covenant is that which has been made without using Allah's name. 
Though this is third in importance, its fulfillment is as important as that of 
the first two and the violation of any of these has been prohibited. <br><br>
91In this connection it should be noted that Allah has rebuked the people for 
the worst form of violation of treaties which has been creating the greatest 
disorder in the world. It is a pity that even "big" people consider it to be a 
virtue to violate treaties in order to gain advantages for their people in 
political, economic and religious conflicts. At one time the leader of one 
nation enters into a treaty with another nation for the interest of his own 
people but at another time the same leader publicly breaks the very same treaty 
for the interest of his people, or secretly violates it. It is an irony that 
such violations are made even by those people who are honest in their private 
lives. Moreover, it is regrettable that their own people do not protest against 
them; nay, they eulogize them for such shameful feats of diplomacy. Therefore, 
Allah warns that every such treaty is a test of the character of those who enter 
into it, and of their nations. They might gain some apparent advantage for their 
people in this way, but they will not escape their consequences on the Day of 
Judgment.<br><br>92This is to warn that decision about differences and disputes 
that lead to conflict, will be made on the Day of Judgment. Therefore, these 
should not be made an excuse to break agreements and treaties. Even if one is 
wholly in the right and the opponent is wholly in the wrong, it is not right for 
the former to break treaties or make false propaganda or employ other deceitful 
methods to defeat the other. If one does so, it will go against him on that Day 
because righteousness demands that one should not only be right in one's 
theories and aims but should also use right methods and employ right means. This 
warning has especially been given to those religious groups and sects who always 
suffer from this misunderstanding that they have a right to defeat their 
opponents because they are on the side of God and their opponents are rebels 
against Allah: therefore, there is no obligation on them to stick to their 
treaties with their opponents. This was what the Arab Jews practiced, declaring, 
"There is no moral obligation on us in regard to the pagan Arabs, and we are 
rightly entitled to practice dishonesty and deceit that might be of advantage to 
us and harmful to the disbelievers."<br><br>93This further supports the previous 
warning. It means that it would be wrong for any champion of Allah's religion to 
arrogate to himself the use of every sort of method and means irrespective of 
whether they are right or wrong to propagate his own religion (considering it to 
be Allah's Religion) and try to destroy opposite religions. For this would be 
utterly against the will of Allah: if Allah had willed that there should be no 
religious differences, He could have deprived mankind of the freedom of choice. 
In that case, there would have been no need for Allah to get help of any such 
up-holder of His Religion, who uses disgraceful means for this purpose. Allah 
could have created all mankind to be inherent believers and obedient servants by 
depriving them of the power and option of disbelief and sin. Then there would 
have been none who could have dared to deviate from belief and obedience. <br>
<br>94This is to show that Allah Himself has given man the power and freedom to 
follow any out of the many ways. That is why Allah makes arrangements for the 
guidance of the one who intends to follow the right way, and lets go astray the 
one who desires to deviate.<br><br>95That is, "Someone,who might have been 
convinced of Islam, seeing your dishonest conduct should become disgusted and 
hold back from joining the Believers." For he might argue like this:"As these 
Muslims are not much different from the disbelievers in their morals and 
dealings, there is no reason why I should join them."<br><br>96That is, "The 
Covenant that you may make in the name of Allah as a representative of His 
religion."<br><br>97It does not mean that they should barter away Allah's 
Covenant for some big gain. What it implies is that any worldly gain howsoever 
great, is insignificant as compared with the worth of Allah's Covenant. 
Therefore, it will be a losing bargain to barter that away for any worldly gain, 
which is after all paltry.<br><br>98Those who practice fortitude are the people 
who will always stand Finn in the struggle between right and truth on one side 
and greed and lust on the other. They bear every loss for the sake of 
righteousness and spurn away every gain that they might obtain by adopting 
unlawful means. They patiently wait for the rewards of their good deeds in the 
Hereafter.<br><br>99This verse removes the wrong notions of both the Muslims and 
the disbelievers who are of the opinion that those who adopt a just honest and 
pious attitude, are most surely losers in this world, though they might be 
gainers in the Hereafter. Allah removes this misunderstanding, as if to say, 
"This presumption of yours is wrong. The righteous attitude not only leads to a 
happy life in the Hereafter, but it also guarantees, by Allah's grace, a pure 
and happy life even in this world. " And this is a fact: those people who are 
sincerely righteous, honest, pure and fair in their dealings. Enjoy a much 
better life in this world, for they enjoy that confidence and real honor and 
respect because of their spotless character, which is not enjoyed by those who 
lack these virtues. They obtain such pure and outstanding successes as are 
denied to those who employ dirty and disgusting ways to win success. Above all, 
they enjoy, even though they might be living in huts, that peace of mind and 
satisfaction of conscience which is denied to the wicked dwellers of mansions 
and palaces.<br><br>100That is, "Their rank in the Hereafter shall be determined 
according to their best deeds". In other words, "If a person has done both small 
and great virtues," he will be awarded that high rank which he would merit 
according to his greatest virtues.<br><br>101This does not mean that one should 
merely repeat the Arabic words: (I seek Allah's refuge against the accursed 
Satan). It means that one should have a sincere desire and do one's utmost to 
guard against Satan's evil suggestions when one is reciting the Holy Qur'an and 
should not allow wrong and irrelevant doubts and suspicions to enter one's 
heart. One should try to sec everything contained in the Qur'an in its true 
light, and refrain from mixing it up with one's self-invented theories or ideas 
foreign to the Qur'an so as to construe its meaning against the will of Allah. 
Moreover, one should feel that the most sinister and avowed design of Satan is 
that the reader should not obtain any guidance from the Quran. This is why Satan 
tries his utmost to delude the reader and pervert him from getting guidance from 
it, and mislead him into wrong ways of thinking. Therefore, the reader should be 
fully on his guard against Satan and seek Allah's refuge for help so that Satan 
should not be able to deprive him of the benefits froth this source of guidance, 
for one who fails to get guidance from this source, will never be able to get 
guidance from any where else. Above all, the one who seeks to obtain deviation 
from this Book, is so entangled in deviation that he can never get out of this 
vicious circle.<br><br>The context in which this verse occurs here is to serve 
as an introduction to the answers to the questions which the mushriks of Makkah 
were raising against the Qur'an. They have been warned that they could 
appreciate the blessing of the Qur'an only if they would try to see it in its 
true light by seeking Allah's protection against Satan's misleading suggestions, 
and not by raising objections against it. Otherwise Satan does not let a man 
understand the Qur'an and its teachings.<br><br>102This may also mean, "To send 
down one Commandment to elaborate upon the other, for the Commandments were sent 
down piecemeal in the Qur'an". For instance, the Commandments about 
"prohibition" and fornication were sent down gradually one after the other 
during several years. But We hesitate to accept this interpretation because An-Nahl 
is a Makki Surah and to the best of our information there is no instance to show 
that Commandments were sent down piecemeal at Makkah. Therefore, we prefer the 
other interpretation. The Qur'an has added details of one theme and explained 
the same with different kinds of illustrations at different places. Likewise it 
has related a story in different words at different places and presented its 
different aspects and details at other places. It has put forward one argument 
at one place to prove a theme and another at another place to prove the same 
theme. It has related one theme concisely at one place and in detail at the 
other. That is what the disbelievers of Makkah put forward as proof that 
Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) forged the Qur'an himself. They argued like 
this: "Had the Qur'an been the Word of Allah it would have related in full one 
thing at one place, for Allah's knowledge is not defective that He should have 
to think out gradually the details of a theme and to give different versions to 
explain the same thing. In contrast to this, the knowledge of a human being is 
defective. A man has to think out gradually as has been done in the case of the 
Qur'an which is a clear proof that you have forged it yourself."<br><br>103The 
Holy Spirit': `fibril'. Instead of using the name of the Angel who brought 
Revelation, his title has been deliberately mentioned to warn the disbelievers 
that the 'Holy Spirit' who brought Revelation, is free from human frailties. He 
is neither dishonest that he should add something to or take away something from 
the Message he brought, nor is he a liar and forger that he should invent and 
state something in the name of Allah. Nor does he suffer from any human lust 
that he should practice a deceit. He is wholly pure and holy and conveys the 
Word of Allah intact.<br><br>104That is, "The fact that Allah sends down His 
Message piecemeal does not mean that Allah's knowledge and wisdom are defective 
as you consider because of your folly. Allah sends His Revelations gradually 
because human intelligence and capacity to grasp are limited and defective which 
do not let him understand the whole theme at one and the same time and make it 
firm in his mind. Therefore, Allah in His wisdom conveyed His Revelation 
piecemeal through the Holy Spirit. He sends a theme gradually and gives its 
details by and by and uses different methods and .ways to make it plain to human 
beings so that they might grasp it according to their abilities and capabilities 
and become firm in their faith and knowledge.<br><br>105The second practical 
wisdom of sending down the Qur'an piecemeal was that those Believers, who 
obediently followed it, should get necessary instructions for the propagation of 
Islam and the solution of other problems of life at the time when they were 
actually needed. It is obvious that if those instructions had been sent down 
before time and at one and the same time they would not have been useful.<br>
<br>106The third practical wisdom of not sending down the Qur'an as a whole at 
one and the same time was to give good tidings and encouragement to the obedient 
servants who were suffering from persecution and encountering great obstacles 
because they needed it over and over again. That is why they were assured of 
ultimate success time and again to fill them with hope to carry on their 
mission.<br><br>107In this connection, traditions mention the names of several 
persons, one of whom (Jabar), according to the disbelievers of Makkah taught the 
Holy Prophet; however, one thing particularly noteworthy about all these persons 
is that they were non-Arab slaves. Whosoever he might be, the fact that he used 
to recite the Torah and the Gospel and had an acquaintance with the Holy 
Prophet, gave an opportunity to the disbelievers for spreading this false report 
that it was the particular slave who was the real author of the Holy Qur'an, but 
Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) presented it as the Word of God. This not 
only shows that his opponents were very impudent in spreading false accusations 
against the Holy Prophet but also that, in general, people are not just in 
judging the worth of their contemporaries. They were ill-treating like this that 
great personality who has had no parallel in history. Nevertheless, these people 
who had become blind in their opposition, preferred to attribute the authorship 
of the matchless Arabic Qur'an to a non-Arab slave who had a smattering of the 
Torah and the Gospel. Instead of accepting the claim of the Holy Prophet, who 
was an embodiment of truth, they attributed its authorship to an insignificant 
foreign slave.<br><br>108This verse can also be rendered like this: "A Prophet 
does not forge any false thing but those, who do not believe in the Revelations 
of Allah, invent falsehoods."<br><br>109This verse deals with the case of those 
Muslims who were being persecuted with cruelty and were being-subjected to 
unbearable torments to force them to give up their Faith. They are being told 
that if at any time they are forced to utter words of disbelief to save their 
lives, when in fact in their hearts they are secure against disbelief, they will 
be pardoned. On the other hand, if they accepted unbelief from the core of their 
hearts, they shall not escape the torment of Allah even if they succeed in 
saving their lives.<br><br>It does not, however, mean that one should utter 
words of disbelief to save one's life. This is merely a permission but not the 
ideal thing for a Believer. According to this permission if one utters such a 
thing, he shall not be taken to account. In fact, the ideal for a Believer is to 
utter words of truth in any case whether his body is cut into pieces. There are 
instances which show that during the period of the Holy Prophet some acted upon 
the ideal while others took advantage of the permission. There was Khabbab bin 
Art (May Allah be pleased with him) who was made to lie on embers of fire until 
the fire was extinguished by the melting of his fat, but he remained firm in his 
Faith. Then there was Bilal Habashi (May Allah be pleased with him) who was made 
to put on an armor and stand in the scorching heat. Then he was dragged on the 
burning sand but he went on saying, "Allah is one." There was another Believer, 
Habib Gin Zaid bin `Asim, whose limbs were cut one by one by the order of 
Musailimah, the Liar. Each time his limb was severed it was demanded of him that 
he should acknowledge the Liar as a prophet but each time he refused to bear 
witness to his claim of prophethood until he breathed his last. On the other 
hand, there was the instance of Ammar bin Yasir (May Allah be pleased with him) 
whose parents were mercilessly butchered before his eyes. After this he himself 
was put to such unbearable torture that, in order to save his life, he had to 
utter the same words of unbelief that were demanded of him. Afterwards when he 
came crying to the Holy Prophet, he said, "O Messenger of Allah, they did not 
let me go until I spoke evil of you and praised their deities" . The Holy 
Prophet asked him, "How do you feel about this, in your heart?" He replied 
humbly, "My heart is fully convinced of the Faith." At this the Holy Prophet 
replied, "If they put you to the same torture again, you may utter the same 
words" . <br><br>110These words apply to those people who gave up their Faith, 
when they felt that they could not bear hardships of the Right Way and so they 
again joined their unbelieving, mushrik people.<br><br>111They were those 
Believers who migrated to Habashah.<br><br>112That habitation has not been 
specified here nor have the commentators definitely pointed out which that 
habitation was. However, there is a saying of Ibn `Abbas (which seems to be 
correct) that the place referred to is Makkah itself. In that case, "hunger and 
fear" will mean the famine which prevailed over the people of Makkah for several 
years during the Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him).<br><br>
113This shows that the above mentioned famine had come to an end at the time of 
the revelation of this Surah. <br><br>114Here the observation of the lawful and 
the unlawful has been made the test of worship of Allah. Those who claim to be 
the servants of Allah will eat what is lawful and pure and show gratitude to Him 
and will scrupulously refrain from what is forbidden and impure.<br><br>
115Please refer also to II: 173, V: 3 and VI: 145.<br><br>116This verse clearly 
shows that none but Allah has the right to declare a thing to be lawful or 
unlawful. Or, in other words, the right of making laws exclusively rests with 
Allah. Therefore, any person, who will dare to decide about the lawful and the 
unlawful, will transgress his powers. Of course, a person, who acknowledges the 
Divine law as the final authority, may deduce from it whether a certain thing or 
action is lawful or unlawful.<br><br>The arrogation of the right of determining 
the lawful and the unlawful has been declared to be a falsehood on Allah for two 
reasons: (1) Such a person, so to say, claims that what he declares to be lawful 
or unlawful disregarding the authority of the Divine Book, has been made lawful 
or unlawful by God or (2) he means to claim that Allah has given up the 
authority of making lawful and unlawful and has thus left man free to make his 
own laws for the conduct of life. It is obvious that each of these claims will 
be a "falsehood" and a false imputation to Allah.<br><br>117In this paragraph 
(vv. 118-124), answers to the objections raised by the disbelievers of Makkah 
concerning the Commandments contained in vv. 114-117 have been given. Their 
first objection was: "Besides the above-mentioned unlawful things, there are 
other unlawful things in the Jewish Law which have been made lawful by you. If 
that law was from Allah and yours is also from Allah why do they then contradict 
each other?" Their second objection was: "You have abrogated the sanctity of the 
Sabbath of the Israelites. Have you done this of your own accord or by Allah's 
Command? In the latter case then will be an obvious contradiction in the two 
laws. Or has Allah Himself given two contradictory Commandments?" <br><br>
118This refers to: "And We prohibited all animals with claws to those people who 
had adopted Judaism...." (VI: 146). In this verse (117) Allah has stated that 
certain things were made unlawful because of the disobedience of the Jews.<br>
<br>Here a question arises: Which of the two Surahs, Al-An`am or An-Nahl, was 
first revealed? This is because in verse 118, a reference has been made to verse 
146 of Al-An`am and in verse 119 of Al-An`am, "And why should you not eat that 
thing over which Allah's name has been mentioned, when He has already given you 
a detail of those things that have been declared to be unlawful for you except m 
case of extremity....?", a reference has been made to verse 115 of AnNahl. This 
is because these are the only two Makki Surahs in which details of unlawful 
things have been given. As regards the question, we are of the opinion that An-NahI 
was revealed earlier than AI-An`am, for verse 119 of the latter contains a 
reference to verse 115 of the former. It appears that after the revelation of 
Surah AI-An`am, the disbelievers raised objections in regard to these verses of 
An-Nahl. So they were referred to verse 146 of AI-An`am in which a few things 
were made unlawful, especially for the Jews. As this answer concerned An-Nahl, 
so verse 118, though it was revealed after the revelation of Al-An`am, was 
inserted as a parenthetical clause in An-Nahl.<br><br>119"Abraham was a 
community in himself" for at that time he was the only Muslim in the whole world 
who was upholding the banner of Islam, while the rest of the world was upholding 
the banner of unbelief. As that servant of Allah performed the Mission which is 
ordinarily carried out by a whole community, he was not one person but an 
institution in himself. <br><br>120This is the complete answer to the first 
objection (E.N. 117) raised by the disbelievers. This has two parts:<br><br>(1) 
There is no contradiction in the Divine Law as you seem to presume on the 
apparent variance in the Jewish and the Islamic Law. As a matter of fact a few 
things had been made unlawful especially for the Jews as punishment to them 
because of their disobedience; therefore, there was no reason why others should 
be deprived of those good things.<br><br>(2) Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be 
upon him) was commanded to follow the way of Abraham and not the way of the 
Jews, and they themselves knew than these things were not unlawful in the law of 
Abraham. For instance, the Jews did not eat the flesh of camel but this was 
lawful according to Abraham. Likewise, ostrich, hare, duck, etc., were unlawful 
in the Jewish law, but they were lawful according to Abraham. Incidentally the 
disbelievers of Makkah have been warned that neither they nor the Jews had any 
relationship with Prophet Abraham for he was not a mushrik while both of them 
were practicing shirk. Prophet Muhammad and his followers were the only true 
followers of Prophet Abraham (Allah's peace be upon them) for there was no tinge 
of shirk in their creed or in their practice.<br><br>121This is the answer to 
their second objection. Obviously, there was no need to state that the 
restrictions about the Sabbath applied only to the Jews and had nothing to do 
with the law of Prophet Abraham, because they themselves knew it. The 
restrictions were imposed upon the Jews because of their mischiefs and 
violations of the law. In order to understand fully the significance of this 
reference one is requested to read those passages of the Bible in which 
Commandments about the Sabbath have been stated, e.g., Exodus 20: 8-11, 23: 
12-13,31: 1-17, 35: 23, and Numbers 15: 32-36. Besides this, one should also be 
acquainted with the impudent violations of the Sabbath. See Jeremiah: 17: 21-27 
and Ezekiel. 10: 18-24.<br><br>122This instruction is very important for those 
who are engaged in the propagation of Islam. They should always keep in view two 
things- "wisdom" and "excellent admonition". "Wisdom" implies that one should 
use discretion in the work of propagation and should not do this blindly like 
foolish people. Wisdom demands that one should keep in view the intelligence, 
capability and circumstances of the addressees and convey the Message in 
accordance with the requirements of the occasion. Moreover, one should refrain 
from applying one and the same method to each and every person or group but 
should first diagnose the real disease of the addressee and then cure it by 
appealing to his head and heart.<br><br>"Excellent admonition" implies two 
things: (1) One should not be content with convincing the addressee with 
arguments alone but should also appeal to his feelings. Likewise one should not 
confine oneself merely to arguments in condemning evils and deviations but 
should try to convince the other of their repugnance that lies embedded in the 
human nature. One should also warn of the worst consequences of those evils. 
Besides, one should not only try to convince the addressee rationally of the 
soundness and excellence of guidance and righteous deeds but should also create 
in him interest and love for them. (2) Admonition should be administered in such 
a manner as to show sincere concern for and the welfare of the addressee. 
Nothing should be said or done to create the impression that the admonisher is 
looking down upon him and taking pleasure in his own feeling of superiority. On 
the contrary, he should feel that the admonisher is filled with the strong 
desire for his reform and welfare.<br><br>123"Best manner" implies that one 
should have a sweet tongue, show noble character and give reasonable and 
appealing arguments, and refrain from indulging in polemics, argumentation and 
controversies. The one who discusses things with people in the best manner, does 
not resort to accusations, crooked arguments, taunts, nor makes fun of the 
opponent in order to defeat him and to win applause for his own superiority in 
argument. For these things will produce obduracy and obstinacy. In contrast to 
this, he will try to convince the other in a simple and humble way, and when he 
feels that the other person has come down to crooked arguments, he will leave 
him alone lest the other should go further and further astray in his deviation.<br>
<br>124"Allah is with those who fear Him" because they scrupulously refrain from 
evil ways and always adopt the righteous attitude, for they know that their 
actions and deeds are not determined by the evils others do to them but by their 
own sense of righteousness; so they return good for evil."</p>
