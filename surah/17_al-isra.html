                  <li class="collection-item"> Glory to (Allah) Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless,- in order that We might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who heareth and seeth (all things).</li><li class="collection-item"> We gave Moses the Book, and made it a Guide to the Children of Israel, (commanding): "Take not other than Me as Disposer of (your) affairs."</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye that are sprung from those whom We carried (in the Ark) with Noah! Verily he was a devotee most grateful.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We gave (Clear) Warning to the Children of Israel in the Book, that twice would they do mischief on the earth and be elated with mighty arrogance (and twice would they be punished)!</li><li class="collection-item"> When the first of the warnings came to pass, We sent against you Our servants given to terrible warfare: They entered the very inmost parts of your homes; and it was a warning (completely) fulfilled.</li><li class="collection-item"> Then did We grant you the Return as against them: We gave you increase in resources and sons, and made you the more numerous in man-power.</li><li class="collection-item"> If ye did well, ye did well for yourselves; if ye did evil, (ye did it) against yourselves. So when the second of the warnings came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disfigure your faces, and to enter your Temple as they had entered it before, and to visit with destruction all that fell into their power.</li><li class="collection-item"> It may be that your Lord may (yet) show Mercy unto you; but if ye revert (to your sins), We shall revert (to Our punishments): And we have made Hell a prison for those who reject (all Faith).</li><li class="collection-item"> Verily this Qur´an doth guide to that which is most right (or stable), and giveth the Glad Tidings to the Believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they shall have a magnificent reward;</li><li class="collection-item"> And to those who believe not in the Hereafter, (it announceth) that We have prepared for them a Penalty Grievous (indeed).</li><li class="collection-item"> The prayer that man should make for good, he maketh for evil; for man is given to hasty (deeds).</li><li class="collection-item"> We have made the Night and the Day as two (of Our) Signs: the Sign of the Night have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten you; that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the number and count of the years: all things have We explained in detail.</li><li class="collection-item"> Every man´s fate We have fastened on his own neck: On the Day of Judgment We shall bring out for him a scroll, which he will see spread open.</li><li class="collection-item"> (It will be said to him:) "Read thine (own) record: Sufficient is thy soul this day to make out an account against thee."</li><li class="collection-item"> Who receiveth guidance, receiveth it for his own benefit: who goeth astray doth so to his own loss: No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another: nor would We visit with Our Wrath until We had sent an messenger (to give warning).</li><li class="collection-item"> When We decide to destroy a population, We (first) send a definite order to those among them who are given the good things of this life and yet transgress; so that the word is proved true against them: then (it is) We destroy them utterly.</li><li class="collection-item"> How many generations have We destroyed after Noah? and enough is thy Lord to note and see the sins of His servants.</li><li class="collection-item"> If any do wish for the transitory things (of this life), We readily grant them - such things as We will, to such person as We will: in the end have We provided Hell for them: they will burn therein, disgraced and rejected.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who do wish for the (things of) the Hereafter, and strive therefor with all due striving, and have Faith,- they are the ones whose striving is acceptable (to Allah).</li><li class="collection-item"> Of the bounties of thy Lord We bestow freely on all- These as well as those: The bounties of thy Lord are not closed (to anyone).</li><li class="collection-item"> See how We have bestowed more on some than on others; but verily the Hereafter is more in rank and gradation and more in excellence.</li><li class="collection-item"> Take not with Allah another object of worship; or thou (O man!) wilt sit in disgrace and destitution.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thy Lord hath decreed that ye worship none but Him, and that ye be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in thy life, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honour.</li><li class="collection-item"> And, out of kindness, lower to them the wing of humility, and say: "My Lord! bestow on them thy Mercy even as they cherished me in childhood."</li><li class="collection-item"> Your Lord knoweth best what is in your hearts: If ye do deeds of righteousness, verily He is Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him again and again (in true penitence).</li><li class="collection-item"> And render to the kindred their due rights, as (also) to those in want, and to the wayfarer: But squander not (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.</li><li class="collection-item"> Verily spendthrifts are brothers of the Evil Ones; and the Evil One is to his Lord (himself) ungrateful.</li><li class="collection-item"> And even if thou hast to turn away from them in pursuit of the Mercy from thy Lord which thou dost expect, yet speak to them a word of easy kindness.</li><li class="collection-item"> Make not thy hand tied (like a niggard´s) to thy neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach, so that thou become blameworthy and destitute.</li><li class="collection-item"> Verily thy Lord doth provide sustenance in abundance for whom He pleaseth, and He provideth in a just measure. For He doth know and regard all His servants.</li><li class="collection-item"> Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you. Verily the killing of them is a great sin.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor come nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful (deed) and an evil, opening the road (to other evils).</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor take life - which Allah has made sacred - except for just cause. And if anyone is slain wrongfully, we have given his heir authority (to demand qisas or to forgive): but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped (by the Law).</li><li class="collection-item"> Come not nigh to the orphan´s property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength; and fulfil (every) engagement, for (every) engagement will be enquired into (on the Day of Reckoning).</li><li class="collection-item"> Give full measure when ye measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight: that is the most fitting and the most advantageous in the final determination.</li><li class="collection-item"> And pursue not that of which thou hast no knowledge; for every act of hearing, or of seeing or of (feeling in) the heart will be enquired into (on the Day of Reckoning).</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor walk on the earth with insolence: for thou canst not rend the earth asunder, nor reach the mountains in height.</li><li class="collection-item"> Of all such things the evil is hateful in the sight of thy Lord.</li><li class="collection-item"> These are among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee. Take not, with Allah, another object of worship, lest thou shouldst be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected.</li><li class="collection-item"> Has then your Lord (O Pagans!) preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself daughters among the angels? Truly ye utter a most dreadful saying!</li><li class="collection-item"> We have explained (things) in various (ways) in this Qur´an, in order that they may receive admonition, but it only increases their flight (from the Truth)!</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: If there had been (other) gods with Him, as they say,- behold, they would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne!</li><li class="collection-item"> Glory to Him! He is high above all that they say!- Exalted and Great (beyond measure)!</li><li class="collection-item"> The seven heavens and the earth, and all beings therein, declare His glory: there is not a thing but celebrates His praise; And yet ye understand not how they declare His glory! Verily He is Oft-Forbear, Most Forgiving!</li><li class="collection-item"> When thou dost recite the Qur´an, We put, between thee and those who believe not in the Hereafter, a veil invisible:</li><li class="collection-item"> And We put coverings over their hearts (and minds) lest they should understand the Qur´an, and deafness into their ears: when thou dost commemorate thy Lord and Him alone in the Qur´an, they turn on their backs, fleeing (from the Truth).</li><li class="collection-item"> We know best why it is they listen, when they listen to thee; and when they meet in private conference, behold, the wicked say, "Ye follow none other than a man bewitched!"</li><li class="collection-item"> See what similes they strike for thee: but they have gone astray, and never can they find a way.</li><li class="collection-item"> They say: "What! when we are reduced to bones and dust, should we really be raised up (to be) a new creation?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "(Nay!) be ye stones or iron,</li><li class="collection-item"> "Or created matter which, in your minds, is hardest (to be raised up),- (Yet shall ye be raised up)!" then will they say: "Who will cause us to return?" Say: "He who created you first!" Then will they wag their heads towards thee, and say, "When will that be?" Say, "May be it will be quite soon!</li><li class="collection-item"> "It will be on a Day when He will call you, and ye will answer (His call) with (words of) His praise, and ye will think that ye tarried but a little while!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Say to My servants that they should (only) say those things that are best: for Satan doth sow dissensions among them: For Satan is to man an avowed enemy.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is your Lord that knoweth you best: If He please, He granteth you mercy, or if He please, punishment: We have not sent thee to be a disposer of their affairs for them.</li><li class="collection-item"> And it is your Lord that knoweth best all beings that are in the heavens and on earth: We did bestow on some prophets more (and other) gifts than on others: and We gave to David (the gift of) the Psalms.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Call on those - besides Him - whom ye fancy: they have neither the power to remove your troubles from you nor to change them."</li><li class="collection-item"> Those whom they call upon do desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord, - even those who are nearest: they hope for His Mercy and fear His Wrath: for the Wrath of thy Lord is something to take heed of.</li><li class="collection-item"> There is not a population but We shall destroy it before the Day of Judgment or punish it with a dreadful Penalty: that is written in the (eternal) Record.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We refrain from sending the signs, only because the men of former generations treated them as false: We sent the she-camel to the Thamud to open their eyes, but they treated her wrongfully: We only send the Signs by way of terror (and warning from evil).</li><li class="collection-item"> Behold! We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round about: We granted the vision which We showed thee, but as a trial for men,- as also the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Qur´an: We put terror (and warning) into them, but it only increases their inordinate transgression!</li><li class="collection-item"> Behold! We said to the angels: "Bow down unto Adam": They bowed down except Iblis: He said, "Shall I bow down to one whom Thou didst create from clay?"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "Seest Thou? this is the one whom Thou hast honoured above me! If Thou wilt but respite me to the Day of Judgment, I will surely bring his descendants under my sway - all but a few!"</li><li class="collection-item"> (Allah) said: "Go thy way; if any of them follow thee, verily Hell will be the recompense of you (all)- an ample recompense.</li><li class="collection-item"> "Lead to destruction those whom thou canst among them, with thy (seductive) voice; make assaults on them with thy cavalry and thy infantry; mutually share with them wealth and children; and make promises to them." But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.</li><li class="collection-item"> "As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them:" Enough is thy Lord for a Disposer of affairs.</li><li class="collection-item"> Your Lord is He That maketh the Ship go smoothly for you through the sea, in order that ye may seek of his Bounty. For he is unto you most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> When distress seizes you at sea, those that ye call upon - besides Himself - leave you in the lurch! but when He brings you back safe to land, ye turn away (from Him). Most ungrateful is man!</li><li class="collection-item"> Do ye then feel secure that He will not cause you to be swallowed up beneath the earth when ye are on land, or that He will not send against you a violent tornado (with showers of stones) so that ye shall find no one to carry out your affairs for you?</li><li class="collection-item"> Or do ye feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea and send against you a heavy gale to drown you because of your ingratitude, so that ye find no helper. Therein against Us?</li><li class="collection-item"> We have honoured the sons of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on them special favours, above a great part of our creation.</li><li class="collection-item"> One day We shall call together all human beings with their (respective) Imams: those who are given their record in their right hand will read it (with pleasure), and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least.</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who were blind in this world, will be blind in the hereafter, and most astray from the Path.</li><li class="collection-item"> And their purpose was to tempt thee away from that which We had revealed unto thee, to substitute in our name something quite different; (in that case), behold! they would certainly have made thee (their) friend!</li><li class="collection-item"> And had We not given thee strength, thou wouldst nearly have inclined to them a little.</li><li class="collection-item"> In that case We should have made thee taste an equal portion (of punishment) in this life, and an equal portion in death: and moreover thou wouldst have found none to help thee against Us!</li><li class="collection-item"> Their purpose was to scare thee off the land, in order to expel thee; but in that case they would not have stayed (therein) after thee, except for a little while.</li><li class="collection-item"> (This was Our) way with the messengers We sent before thee: thou wilt find no change in Our ways.</li><li class="collection-item"> Establish regular prayers - at the sun´s decline till the darkness of the night, and the morning prayer and reading: for the prayer and reading in the morning carry their testimony.</li><li class="collection-item"> And pray in the small watches of the morning: (it would be) an additional prayer (or spiritual profit) for thee: soon will thy Lord raise thee to a Station of Praise and Glory!</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "O my Lord! Let my entry be by the Gate of Truth and Honour, and likewise my exit by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and grant me from Thy Presence an authority to aid (me)."</li><li class="collection-item"> And say: "Truth has (now) arrived, and Falsehood perished: for Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to perish."</li><li class="collection-item"> We send down (stage by stage) in the Qur´an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe: to the unjust it causes nothing but loss after loss.</li><li class="collection-item"> Yet when We bestow Our favours on man, he turns away and becomes remote on his side (instead of coming to Us), and when evil seizes him he gives himself up to despair!</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Everyone acts according to his own disposition: But your Lord knows best who it is that is best guided on the Way."</li><li class="collection-item"> They ask thee concerning the Spirit (of inspiration). Say: "The Spirit (cometh) by command of my Lord: of knowledge it is only a little that is communicated to you, (O men!)"</li><li class="collection-item"> If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We have sent thee by inspiration:then wouldst thou find none to plead thy affair in that matter as against Us,-</li><li class="collection-item"> Except for Mercy from thy Lord: for his bounty is to thee (indeed) great.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "If the whole of mankind and Jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this Qur´an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed up each other with help and support.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We have explained to man, in this Qur´an, every kind of similitude: yet the greater part of men refuse (to receive it) except with ingratitude!</li><li class="collection-item"> They say: "We shall not believe in thee, until thou cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth,</li><li class="collection-item"> "Or (until) thou have a garden of date trees and vines, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst, carrying abundant water;</li><li class="collection-item"> "Or thou cause the sky to fall in pieces, as thou sayest (will happen), against us; or thou bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face:</li><li class="collection-item"> "Or thou have a house adorned with gold, or thou mount a ladder right into the skies. No, we shall not even believe in thy mounting until thou send down to us a book that we could read." Say: "Glory to my Lord! Am I aught but a man,- a messenger?"</li><li class="collection-item"> What kept men back from belief when Guidance came to them, was nothing but this: they said, "Has Allah sent a man (like us) to be (His) Messenger?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Say, "If there were settled, on earth, angels walking about in peace and quiet, We should certainly have sent them down from the heavens an angel for a messenger."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Enough is Allah for a witness between me and you: for He is well acquainted with His servants, and He sees (all things).</li><li class="collection-item"> It is he whom Allah guides, that is on true Guidance; but he whom He leaves astray - for such wilt thou find no protector besides Him. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather, them together, prone on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf: their abode will be Hell: every time it shows abatement, We shall increase from them the fierceness of the Fire.</li><li class="collection-item"> That is their recompense, because they rejected Our signs, and said, "When we are reduced to bones and broken dust, should we really be raised up (to be) a new Creation?"</li><li class="collection-item"> See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, has power to create the like of them (anew)? Only He has decreed a term appointed, of which there is no doubt. But the unjust refuse (to receive it) except with ingratitude.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "If ye had control of the Treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, behold, ye would keep them back, for fear of spending them: for man is (every) niggardly!"</li><li class="collection-item"> To Moses We did give Nine Clear Signs: As the Children of Israel: when he came to them, Pharaoh said to him: "O Moses! I consider thee, indeed, to have been worked upon by sorcery!</li><li class="collection-item"> Moses said, "Thou knowest well that these things have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-opening evidence: and I consider thee indeed, O Pharaoh, to be one doomed to destruction!"</li><li class="collection-item"> So he resolved to remove them from the face of the earth: but We did drown him and all who were with him.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, "Dwell securely in the land (of promise)": but when the second of the warnings came to pass, We gathered you together in a mingled crowd.</li><li class="collection-item"> We sent down the (Qur´an) in Truth, and in Truth has it descended: and We sent thee but to give Glad Tidings and to warn (sinners).</li><li class="collection-item"> (It is) a Qur´an which We have divided (into parts from time to time), in order that thou mightest recite it to men at intervals: We have revealed it by stages.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Whether ye believe in it or not, it is true that those who were given knowledge beforehand, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration,</li><li class="collection-item"> "And they say: ´Glory to our Lord! Truly has the promise of our Lord been fulfilled!´"</li><li class="collection-item"> They fall down on their faces in tears, and it increases their (earnest) humility.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Call upon Allah, or call upon Rahman: by whatever name ye call upon Him, (it is well): for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Neither speak thy Prayer aloud, nor speak it in a low tone, but seek a middle course between."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Praise be to Allah, who begets no son, and has no partner in (His) dominion: Nor (needs) He any to protect Him from humiliation: yea, magnify Him for His greatness and glory!"</li>

The very first verse indicates that this Surah was revealed on the occasion of 
Mi`raj (Ascension). According to the Traditions and books on the life of the 
Holy Prophet, this event happened one year before Hijrah. Thus, this Surah is 
one of those which were revealed in the last stage of Prophethood at Makkah.<br>
<br><strong>Background</strong><br><br>The Holy Prophet had been propagating 
Tauhid for the previous twelve years and his opponents had been doing all they 
could to make his Mission a failure, but in spite of all their opposition, Islam 
had spread to every corner of Arabia and there was hardly any clan which had not 
been influenced by his invitation. In Makkah itself the true Believers had 
formed themselves into a small community and were ready and willing to face 
every danger to make Islam a success. Besides them, a very large number of the 
people of Aus and Khazraj (two influential clans of Al-Madinah) had accepted 
Islam. Thus the time had come for the Holy Prophet to emigrate from Makkah to 
Al- Madinah and there gather together the scattered Muslims and establish a 
state based on the principles of Islam.<br><br>These were the conditions when 
Mi`raj took place and on his return the Holy Prophet brought down the Message 
contained in this Surah.<br><br><strong>Theme and Topics</strong><br><br>This 
Surah is a wonderful combination of warning, admonition and instruction, which 
have been blended together in a balanced proportion.<br><br>The disbelievers of 
Makkah had been admonished to take a lesson from the miserable end of the 
Israelites and other communities and mend their ways within the period of 
respite given by Allah, which was about to expire. They should, therefore, 
accept the invitation that was being extended by Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon 
him) and the Quran. Otherwise they shall be annihilated and replaced by other 
people. Incidentally, the Israelites, with whom Islam was going to come in 
direct contact in the near future at Al-Madinah have also been warned that they 
should learn a lesson from the chastisements that have already been inflicted on 
them. They were warned, "Take advantage of the Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's 
peace be upon him) because that is the last opportunity which is being given to 
you. If even now you behave as you have been behaving, you shall meet with a 
painful torment."<br><br>As regards the education of mankind, it has been 
impressed that human success or failure, gain or loss, depends upon the right 
understanding of Tauhid, life-after- death and Prophethood. Accordingly, 
convincing arguments have been put forward to prove that the Quran is the Book 
of Allah and its teachings are true and genuine the doubts of the disbelievers 
about these basic realities have been removed and on suitable occasions they 
have been admonished and rebuked in regard to their ways of ignorance.<br><br>In 
this connection, those fundamental principles of morality and civilization on 
which the Islamic System of life is meant to be established have been put 
forward. Thus this was a sort of the Manifesto of the intended Islamic state 
which had been proclaimed a year before its actual establishment. It has been 
explicitly stated that that was the sketch of the system on which Muhammad 
(Allah's peace be upon him) intended to build human life first in his own 
country and then in the outside world.<br><br>Besides these, the Holy Prophet 
has been instructed to stick firmly to his stand without minding the opposition 
and difficulties which he was encountering and should never think of making a 
compromise with unbelief. The Muslims who sometimes showed signs of impatience, 
when they met with persecution, calumny, and crooked arguments, have also been 
instructed to face adverse circumstances with patience and fortitude and keep 
full control over their feelings and passions. Moreover, salat was prescribed in 
order to reform and purify their souls, as if to say, "This is the thing which 
will produce in you those high qualities of character which are essential for 
everyone who intends to struggle in the righteous way Incidentally, we learn 
from Traditions that Mi'raj was the first occasion on which the five daily 
Prayers were prescribed to be offered at fixed times.</p>
<hr>
<p>The event referred to in this verse is known "Mi`raj" and "Isra"'. According 
to authentic traditions, this took place a year before Hijrah. In the 
traditional and biographical literature, its details have been related by a 
large number (25) of the Companions. Anas bin Malik, Malik bin Sa`asa`ah, Abuzar 
Ghifari, and Abu Hurairah (Allah be pleased with them all) have related details 
of the event. Besides them, `Umar, `Ali, `Abdullah bin Mas`ud...........(Allah 
be pleased with them) have also related some parts of this event.<br><br>In this 
verse, the Qur'an mentions only a part of the Journey, i.e., from Masjid-i-Haram 
to the Temple at Jerusalem. The object of this journey as stated here was that 
Allah willed to show His servant some of His signs. The Qur'an does not give any 
details other than this but we find further details in the traditions, which are 
to this effect:<br><br>One night the Angel Jibril transported the Holy Prophet 
on al-Buraq from Masjid-i-Haram to Masjid-i-Aqsa (the Temple). There the Holy 
Prophet offered his prayers along with the other Prophets. Then he took him 
towards the higher spheres, where he met some of the great Prophets in different 
spheres. At last he reached the Highest Place in the Heavens, and was received 
in audience by Allah. It was there that besides other important instructions 
five daily Prayers were prescribed. Then he returned to the Temple and from 
there came back to Masjid-i-Haram. During this Journey, according to many 
traditions, Paradise and Hell were shown to him. We also learn from authentic 
traditions that on the following day when he mentioned this event, the 
disbelievers of Makkah scoffed at him, and some of the Muslims also were 
skeptical about this.<br><br>The above additional details based on the 
traditions cannot be said to be against the Qur'an, for these are additions to 
the details given in the Qur'an; therefore, the details related in the 
traditions cannot be. rejected on the plea that they are against the Qur'an. 
Nevertheless, if one rejects any part of those details which are given in the 
traditions, one cannot be declared a renegade. On the other hand, if one rejects 
the details given in the Qur'an, one does become a renegade.<br><br>There are 
different versions of this Journey. Some say that this happened in a dream, 
while others are of the opinion that the Holy Prophet was fully awake and went 
on the Journey with his own physical body; some others say that it was merely a 
mystic vision which was shown to him. The opening words of this verse: "Glory be 
to Him, who transported His Servant..." however, clearly show that it was a 
super-natural event which was brought about by the unlimited power of Allah. It 
is quite obvious that if the event had been merely a mystic vision, it would not 
have been introduced by the words which imply that the Being Who brought about 
this event is free from each and every kind of weakness and defect. Again the 
words "transported His servant one night" also show that this was not a dream or 
a vision but a physical journey in which Allah arranged that the Holy Prophet 
should make observation of His Signs with his physical eyes. Therefore, one is 
bound to admit that this was not a mere spiritual experience but a physical 
journey and visual observation which Allah arranged for His Prophet.<br><br>It 
is strange that some people are of the opinion that this extraordinary journey 
could not be possible, but now when man with his limited-very limited power has 
been able to reach the moon, it is absurd to deny that Allah with His limitless 
powers could enable His Messenger to make this journey in the extraordinary 
short time it took.<br><br>Above all, the question whether a thing is possible 
or not, can arise only in the `case of human beings whose powers are after all 
limited, but such questions cannot be raised where the All-Powerful Allah is 
concerned. Only such a person who does not believe that Allah is able to do 
everything can raise objections against this wonderful Journey about which Allah 
Himself says that He transported His Servant one night from Masjid-i-Haram to 
Masjid-i-Aqsa. Likewise all the objections raised against the various details 
which are given in the traditions are frivolous, except two, which are 
plausible:<br><br>First, if we accept these details, then we shall have to admit 
drat Allah is confined to a certain place: otherwise there was no need that His 
Servant should be transported for this purpose to a certain place. Secondly, 
according to traditions, the Holy Prophet was enabled to observe Paradise and 
Hell where he saw some people suffering from torment. The objection is: why 
should sane people be awarded punishments or rewards before the Final Judgment 
after Resurrection?<br><br>As regards the first objection, it is true that Allah 
is Infinite by Himself, but in dealing with His creation, He employs those means 
which suit His imperfect creation not because of any limitation of His, but 
because of the limitations of His creation. For instance, when He speaks to any 
of His creature, He adopts the same limited mode of conversation as the 
addressee can understand, though He has limitless modes of speech. Likewise, 
when He desires to show some of the wonderful Signs of His Kingdom to a servant. 
He transports him to the place where the' Signs are to be shown. It is obvious 
that the servant cannot see at one and the same time the whole of the universe 
as Allah does, for Allah has no need to go to any place at all for this purpose 
but the servant has. The same applies to the appearance of the servant before 
the Creator. Though Allah is not confined to any locality, it is necessary for 
the servant to go to the place where His manifestations have been concentrated 
for his observation because it is not possible for the servant with his limited 
powers to go in His Presence in His Infinite Capacity.<br><br>As regards the 
second objection, it is based on the lack of understanding the thing: many of 
the Signs which were shown to the Holy Prophet were symbolical. For instance, a 
small hole from which a fat ox came out but could not go back into it, 
represented mischief personified. In the same way the adulterers were shown as 
if they had fresh meat before them but instead of that they were eating rotten 
flesh. Similarly punishments for evil deeds shown to him were only symbolic 
observations of the punishments in the Hereafter so that he might see in advance 
the things which would take place in the Hereafter.<br><br>In regard to the Mi 
`raj it should be kept in view that all the Prophets were enabled by Allah to 
see His Signs in the heavens and the earth according to their ranks. And for 
this purpose all the material curtains were lifted so that they could see with 
their naked eyes the unseen realities, to which they were required to invite the 
people.<br><br>This was done so that the Prophets could say with full conviction 
what they had seen with their own eyes. For this experience would distinguish 
there from a philosopher who bases all his theories on guess-work and cannot say 
that he bears witness to what he claims. In contrast to philosophers, Prophets 
could say that they bore witness to the things which they presented because they 
had seen them with their own eyes.<br><br>2As this verse has no apparent 
connection with the event of Mi'raj, it may appear to a cursory reader that 
either of the two verses has been misplaced here. But if we try to understand 
the matter in the context of the theme of the whole Surah, we can easily 
understand the connection between the two. .The main object of this Surah is to 
give a warning to the disbelievers of Makkah. That is why the mention of Mi`raj 
has been made in the very first verse, as if to say, "The person whom you dub as 
an impostor and reject the Book sent down to him, has just now seen with his 
naked eyes great Signs of Allah. So you should learn a lesson from the history 
of the Israelites who discarded the Book of Allah and therefore, were given 
painful punishment."<br><br>3The Arabic word "vakil" (guardian) denotes a person 
who is trustworthy and can be depended upon in regard to one's affairs and may 
be turned to for guidance and help. <br><br>4That is, "You are the descendants 
of Noah and his companions;" therefore ,you should behave in a manner as 
behooves such people. You should make Allah alone your Guardian, for your 
ancestors escaped death from the flood only because they had made Allah their 
Guardian."<br><br>5The original Arabic word "Al-kitab"does not stand here for 
the Torah but for all the Divine Books.<br><br>6Such warnings have been given in 
different Books of the Bible. As regards their first mischief and its evil 
consequences, the Israelites were warned in the Psalms, Isaiah, Jeremiah and 
Ezekiel and the warnings about their second mischief and its severe punishments 
are found in Matthew and Luke. Below are given extracts to confirm this 
statement of the Qur'an.<br><br>Prophet David was the first to warn the 
Israelites in his Psalms of their first mischief:<br><br>"They did not destroy 
the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them: But were mingled among the 
heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols which were a snare 
unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, And 
shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters 
....Therefore, was the. wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, insomuch 
that he abhorred his own inheritance. And he gave them into the hand of the 
heathen;" Psalms: Chapter 106, vv. 34-38, 40; 41. The above events have been 
described in the past tense as if they had already actually happened. The 
Scriptures employ this mode of expression to emphasize the importance of the 
prophesies.<br><br>When this mischief actually carne to pass, Prophet lsaiah 
warned them of its ruinous consequences: "Ah sinful nation, a people laden with 
iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that arc corrupters: they have forsaken 
the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone 
away backward. Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: 
How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; 
righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. Thy princes are rebellious, and 
companions of thieves: everyone loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they 
judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. 
Therefore, saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel. Ah I 
will case me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies: they be 
replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they 
please themselves in the children of strangers. Their land also is full of 
idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers 
have made: Moreover the Lord saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, 
and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they 
go, and making a tinkling with their feet: Therefore, the Lord will smite with a 
scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover 
their secret parts. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. 
And her gates shall lament and mourn: and she being desolate shall sit upon the 
ground. Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the 
river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he 
shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: That this is a 
rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the 
Lord: Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us 
right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: Wherefore thus 
saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in 
oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon: Therefore, this iniquity shall be 
to you as a breach ready to fall, . . . . And he shall break it as the breaking 
of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that 
there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shred to take fire from the 
hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit." (lsaiah, Chapter 1:verses 4-5; 
21-24,Chapter 2:verses 6,8; Chapter 3: verses 16-17, 25-26; Chapter 8: verse 7; 
Chapter 30: verses 9-10, 12-14.)<br><br>After this Prophet Jeremiah raised his 
voice when the flood of corruption swept away everything before it.<br><br>"Thus 
saith the Lord, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone 
far from me, and have walked after vanity and are become vain?<br><br>And I 
brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness 
thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an 
abomination. For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy hands: and 
thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every 
green tree thou wanderest,,playing the harlot. As the thief is ashamed when he 
is found. so is the house of Israel ashamed: they, their kings, their princes, 
and their priests, and their prophets, Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; 
and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto 
me, and not their face but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, 
and save us. But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if 
they can save thee in the time of thy trouble; for according to the number of 
thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. The Lord said also unto me in the days of 
Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? She is 
gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath 
played the harlot. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. And I saw, when for 
all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, 
and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, 
but went and played the harlot also. And it came to pass through the lightness 
of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones 
and with sticks. Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see 
now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if can find a man, if there 
be any that executeth judgments that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it. 
How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by 
them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed 
adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses. They were 
as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbor's wife. Shall 
I not visit for these things? Saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged 
on such a nation as this? Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house 
of Israel, saith the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a 
nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understand what they say. Their 
quiver is an open sepulchre, they arc all mighty men. And they shall eat up 
thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should cat: they 
shall cat up thy flocks and thine herds; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig 
trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the 
sword. And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the 
heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away. Then 
will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of 
Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of- the 
bridegroom and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.<br><br>
And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? 
then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the Lord; Such as are for death, to death; 
and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to 
the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity. And I will 
appoint over them four kinds, saith the Lord: the sword to slay, and the dogs to 
tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and 
destroy." (Jeremiah, Chapter 2: verses 5-7, 20, 26-28; Chapter 3: verses 6-9; 
Chapter 5: verses 1,7-9 15-17; Chapter 7: verses 33, 34; Chapter 15: verses 2, 
3.)<br><br>Then Prophet Ezekiel was raised to warn them in time. Addressing 
Jerusalem he said:<br><br>The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her 
time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself. Behold, the 
princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. In thee 
they have set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt 
by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the 
widow. Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my Sabbaths. In 
thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the 
mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness. In thee have they 
discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set 
apart for pollution. And one hath committed abomination with his neighbor's 
wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee 
hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. In thee have they taken gifts to 
shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of 
thy neighbors by extortion and hast forgotten me, can thine hands be strong, in 
the days that I shall deal with thee? And I will scatter thee among the heathen, 
and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee. 
And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, 
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord." (Ezekiel, Chapter 22: verses 3, 6-12, 
14-16.)<br><br>Besides the above mentioned warnings which were given to 
Israelites at the time of their first mischief, Prophet Jesus Christ warned them 
of the consequences of their second' great mischief. In a forceful address he 
criticized their morel degeneration like this:<br><br>"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, 
thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how 
often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gatherth her 
chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you 
desolate. Verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon 
another, that shall not be thrown down. " (Matthew, Chapter 23: verses 37, 38; 
Chapter 24: verse 2. )<br><br>Then, when the Roman officials were taking Prophet 
Jesus out for crucifixion, and a great company of people including women were 
following him bewailing and lamenting, he addressed them and gave his final 
warnings:<br><br>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep 
not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For, behold, the 
days are coming, in which they shall say; Blessed are the barren, and the wombs 
that never bore, and the paps which never gave suck. Then shall they begin to 
say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. (Luke, Chapter 23: 
verses 2830. ) <br><br>7This refers to the terrible destruction that the 
Israelites suffered at the hands of the Assyrians and Babylonians. One cannot 
fully appreciate the historical background of this merely from the extracts that 
have been reproduced above from the Books of the Prophets. A brief history of 
the Israelites is also needed so that a student may become acquainted with all 
the causes and circumstances on account of which Allah removed this nation, that 
professed to believe in a revealed Book, from the leadership of mankind and 
turned it into a humiliated, condemned and backward community.<br><br>When, 
after the death of Prophet Moses, the Israelites entered Palestine it was 
inhabited by the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzittes, Hivites, Jebusites, 
the Philistines, etc. These communities had adopted the worst kind of idolatry, 
their supreme deity being Ayl whom they regarded as the father of gods and who 
was usually represented by the bull-images. His consort was called Asherah from 
whom had descended a whole line of gods and goddesses, about 70 in number. The 
most powerful god among them was Baal who was regarded as the god of rain and 
growth and the lord of the earth and heavens. In the northern regions his 
consort was called Anathoth and in Palestine Ashtaroth. These two were the 
goddesses of love and procreation. Besides them, there was a god of death, a god 
of disease and famine, and a goddess of health, and thus all the worldly powers 
and agencies stood divided among a large number of deities. The people had 
ascribed such dirty and base qualities and acts to these deities that even a 
worst offender against morality would shun being known by them. Obviously the 
people who have adopted such mean deities for worship and devotion cannot remain 
secure from the worst kind of moral degeneration and the modern excavations have 
shown this conclusively.<br><br>Child sacrifice was a common thing among them. 
Their places of worship had turned into brothels, where women were kept as 
religious prostitutes and illicit relations with them were regarded as a part of 
worship and devotion.<br><br>The Israelites had clearly been told in the 
instructions given in the Torah that they should destroy those communities and 
wrest the land of Palestine from them, and that they should avoid mixing up with 
those people and ward off their moral and ideological weaknesses:<br><br>But 
when the Israelites entered Palestine they set this guidance aside. They not 
only did not establish a united kingdom of their own but fell a prey to tribal 
parochialism. Each of their tribes was content to take a part of the captured 
land and become a separate and independent state. This disunity among them did 
not leave any of the tribes strong enough to purge its territory completely of 
the idolaters, and therefore they had to allow them to live side by side with 
them in the same land. Not only this, but there had remained in the conquered 
territories a cumber of small city states of these idolatrous communities which 
the Israelites had nor been able to subjugate. It is this very thing which has 
been complained against in the extract of the Psalms reproduced above in the 
beginning of E.N. 6.<br><br>The first consequence of intermixing with those 
communities, was that the Israelites also became idolatrous, and gradually began 
to adopt other moral evils also. This has been complained about in the Book of 
Judges as below: "And the children of Israel did evil, in the sight of the Lord, 
and served Baalim: And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought 
them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, the gods of the people 
that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the 
Lord to anger. And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth". 
(Judges, 2: 11-13.)<br><br>The second consequence suffered by the Israelites was 
that the communities whose city-states they had left unconquered and the 
Philistines whose land they had not at all touched set up a united front against 
them and drove them out of a major part of Palestine by incessant attacks, so 
much so that they deprived them of the Holy Ark of their Lord. At last, the 
Israelites felt the need of Establishing a united kingdom of their own under one 
ruler, and on their request Prophet Samuel appointed Saul as their king in 1020 
B.C. (For details see vv. 246-48 and E.N.'s. 268-270 of AI-Baqarah.)<br><br>This 
united kingdom was ruled by three kings: Saul (1020 B.C. to 1004. B.C.), Prophet 
David (1004 to 965 B.C.) and Prophet Solomon (365 to 926 B.C.). These kings 
brought to completion the mission that had been left incomplete by the 
Israelites after the death of Prophet Moses. They annexed all the territories 
except the Phoenician state on the northern and the Philistine state on the 
southern coast, which, of course, became tributaries.<br><br>After the death of 
Prophet Solomon the Israelites again adopted the ways of the world and fought 
among themselves and split into two independent kingdoms, the kingdom of Israel 
in the northern Palestine and Jordan with Samaria ,as its capital, and the 
kingdom of Judah in the southern Palestine and Edom with Jerusalem as its 
capital. These kingdoms were strife-ridden from the very . beginning and this 
state of affairs persisted till the end.<br><br>The rulers and people of the 
kingdom of Israel were the first to be affected grievously by the ideological 
and moral weaknesses of the neighboring communities. Specially after the 
marriage of its ruler, Ahab, with the idolatrous princess Jezebel of Zidon, 
idolatry and other evils began to spread unchecked among the Israelites under 
the official patronage. Prophets Elias and Elisha tried their very best to check 
this deluge but the Israelites who were rapidly degenerating, did not heed their 
warning. At last the wrath of Allah overtook the kingdom of Israel in the shape 
of the Assyrians who started subjecting Palestine to incessant attacks from 900 
B.C. downward. During this period, Prophet Amos (787-747 B.C.) and them Prophet 
Hosea(747-735 B.C.) rose and warned the Israelites again and again but the 
wretched, depraved people did not heed their warnings at all, and transgressed 
all limits. Prophet Amos was banished by the king of Israel from the realm of 
Samaria and warned not to preach his mission in the country Not very long after 
this the wrath of Allah burst upon the kingdom of Israel and its people. The 
Assyrian king Sargon took Samaria in 721 B.C.and put an end to this northern 
kingdom. Thousands of Israelites were put to the sword and 27 thousand of their 
leading men were driven out of their homeland and scattered in the eastern 
districts of the Assyrian empire and replaced by settlers from other parts of 
the empire. When the remaining Israelites intermixed with the settlers they also 
lost gradually their national and cultural identity.<br><br>The other kingdom of 
the Israelites, called the kingdom of Judah, which was set up in southern 
Palestine also began to adopt godless ways soon after the death of Prophet 
Solomon, though its moral degeneration took place at a slower pace than that of 
Israel. Therefore, it was allowed to exist for a longer period. Then, like the 
kingdom of Israel, it also began to be subjected to continual attacks, its 
cities ruined and its capital besieged, but this kingdom could not be wholly 
destroyed by the Assyrians; it only became a tributary. Afterwards, when in 
spite of the best reformatory efforts of Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah the people 
of Judah did not give up idol-worship and other moral evils, king Nebuchadnezzar 
of Babylon attacked and captured the whole of Judah in 598 B.C. including 
Jerusalem and took the king of Judah as prisoner. Even then the Israelites did 
not mend their ways and paid no heed to the warnings and guidance of Prophet 
Jeremiah: Instead of reforming their ways, they started making plans to change 
their fate by revolting against Babylon. At last in 587 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar 
punished them heavily by invading Judah and destroyed all its important cities. 
He razed Jerusalem and Solomon's Temple to the ground and did not leave a wall 
of it standing in place. He drove a large part of the Israelite population out 
of their land and scattered them into the adjoining countries. The people who 
were left behind were cursed and subjected to all kinds of humiliations by the 
neighboring communities.<br><br>This was the first calamity that came as a 
warning to the Israelites and the first chastisement that they suffered as a 
result therof.<br><br>8This refers to the lease of time that the Israelites 
(That is the people of Judah) got after their release from the captivity of 
Babylon. As for the people of Israel and Samaria, they did not rise again after 
their moral and spiritual degeneration. But among the people of Judah there 
still were some people who practiced the truth and invited others also to follow 
it. They carried on their work of invitation to the truth among the remaining 
Israelites in Judah and exhorted those also to repent and follow the truth who 
had been driven out into Babylon and other lands. At last the mercy of Allah 
came to their help. The downfall of Babylon started. The Persian king, Cyrus, 
took Babylon in 539 B.C. and in the following year issued a decree allowing the 
Israelites to return to and re-settle in their homeland. The Israelites began to 
return home in caravan after caravan, and ties continued for along time. Cyrus 
also allowed the Israelites to rebuild the Temple of Solomon but the neighboring 
communities who had settled in this land resisted it. At last Darfius I 
appointed Zerubbabel, a grandson of the last king of Judah, governor of Judah in 
522 B.C. who got the Temple rebuilt under the care of Prophet Haggai, Prophet 
Zechariah and Joshua. In 458 B.C. Ezra arrived in Judah along with an exiled 
group and the Persian king Artaxerxes made the following decree.<br><br>"And 
thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thine hand, set magistrates 
and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such 
as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.<br><br>And 
whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the king let judgment be 
executed speedily upon him whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to 
confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. "(Ezra, 7:25-26).<br><br>Taking 
advantage of this decree, Ezra carried out the revival of the religion of 
Prophet Moses. He gathered together all the righteous and good people from the 
Israelites and set up a strong organization. He compiled and spread the 
Pentateuch which contained the Torah, made arrangements for the religious 
education of the Israelites, enforced the law and started purging the people of 
moral and ideological weaknesses which the had adopted by intermixing with the 
other communities. He compelled they Jews to divorce the idolatrous wives they 
had married, and took a covenant from them that they would worship God alone and 
follow His Law only.<br><br>In 455 B.C. an exiled group came back to Judah under 
Nehemiah whom the Persian king appointed as the ruler of Jerusalem and ordered 
him to build the wall round the city. Thus, after 150 years the Holy city was 
fully restored and became the center of Jewish religion and culture, But the 
Israelites of northern Palestine, and Samaria did not benefit by the work of 
revival done by Ezra. They built a rival sanctuary on Mount Gerizim, and tried 
to make it the religious center for the people of the Book. This caused a 
further, and perhaps the final, split Between the Jews and the Samaritans.<br>
<br>The Jews suffered a set-back for a while with the fall of the Persian Empire 
and the conquests of Alexander the Great and the rise of the Greeks. After the 
death of Alexander, his kingdom was subdivided into three empires. Syria tell to 
the lot of the Seleucide empire, with Antioch as its capital, whose ruler 
Antiochus III incorporated Palestine into his dominions in 198 B.C. These Greek 
conquerors who were idolatrous by precept and freelance morally felt greatly ill 
at ease with the Jewish religion and culture. So, they began to propagate the 
rival Greek way of life and culture by political and economic pressure, and were 
able to win over a strong section of the Israelites who became their helpers. 
This external interference caused a split in the Jewish nation. One group among 
them readily adopted the Greek dress, the Greek language, the Greek way of life 
and the Greek sports, while the other persistently stuck to their own culture 
and way of life.<br><br>In 175 B.C. when Antiochus IV (who was called Epiphanes, 
that is, the manifestation of God) came to the throne, he used all his power and 
authority to stamp out the Jewish religion and culture. He got idols installed 
in the Holy Temple at Jerusalem and forced the Jews to prostrate themselves 
before them. He strictly forbade the rite of offering the sacrifices at the 
altar, and commanded the Jews to offer sacrifices to idolatrous deities instead. 
He proposed death penalty for those who would keep the Torah in their houses, or 
observe the Sabbath or perform circumcision of their children. But the Jews did 
not yield to this coercion, and started a powerful resistance movement, known in 
history as the revolt of the Maccabees. Though in this struggle the sympathies 
of the Greece-oriented Jews were with the Greeks, and they fully cooperated with 
the despots of Antioch to crush the Maccabean revolt, the common Jews who still 
retained the religious fervor of the days of Ezra sided with the Maccabees, who 
were ultimately able to drive out the Greeks and establish a free religious 
state which remained in power till 67 B.C This state prospered and in time 
extended to all those territories which had once been under the control the 
kingdoms of Judah and Israel. It was able to annex a part of the land of the 
Philistines which had remained unconquered even in the days of Prophets David 
and Solomon (Peace be upon them).<br><br>This is the historical background of 
the verse of the Qur'an under commentary. <br><br>9The historical background of 
the second degeneration and its chastisement is as follows:<br><br>The moral and 
religious fervor with which the Maccabees had started their movement gradually 
cooled down and was replaced by love of the world and empty external form. A 
split appeared among them and they themselves invited the Roman General, Pompey, 
to come to Palestine. Pompey turned his attention to this land in 63 B.C. and, 
taking Jerusalem, put an end to the political freedom of the Jews. But the Roman 
conquerors preferred to rule their dominions through the agency of the local 
chiefs rather than by direct control. Therefore, a local government was set up 
in Palestine which eventually passed into the hand of Herod, a clever Jew, in 40 
B.C. This ruler is well known as Herod the Great. He ruled over the whole of 
Palestine and Jordan from 40 to 4 B.C. On the one hand Herod patronized the 
religious leaders to please the Jews, and on the other, he propagated the Roman 
culture and won the goodwill of Caesar by showing his loyalty and faithfulness 
to the Roman Empire. During, his reign, the Jews degenerated and fell to the 
lowest ebb of moral and religious life.<br><br>On the death of Herod his kingdom 
was subdivided into three parts. His son, Archelaus, became the ruler of 
Samaria, Judea and northern Edom. In A.D. 6. however, Caesar Augustus deprived 
him of his authority and put the state under his Roman governor, and this 
arrangement continued up till A.D. 41. This was precisely the time when Prophet 
Jesus (Peace be upon him) appeared to reform the Israelites whose religious 
leaders opposed him tooth and nail and even tried to get him the death sentence 
by the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.<br><br>The second son of Herod, Herod 
Antipas, became the ruler of Galilee and Jordan in northern Palestine, and he 
was the person who got Prophet Yahya (John) (Peace be upon him) beheaded at the 
request and desire of a dancing girl.<br><br>Herod's third son, Philip, 
succeeded to the territories bounded on one side by river Yermuk and on the 
other by Mount Hermon. Philip had been much more deeply influenced by the Roman 
and Greek cultures than his father and brothers. Therefore the preaching of the 
truth could not have even so much effect in his land as it had in the other 
parts of Palestine.<br><br>In A.D. 41, the Romans appointed Herod Agrippa, the 
grandson of Herod the Great, ruler of the territories that had once been under 
Herod himself. Coming into power this man did whatever he could to persecute the 
followers of Prophet Jesus (Peace be upon him) and used all the forces at his 
disposal to crush the movement that was functioning under the guidance of the 
Disciples to inculcate fear of God in the people and reform their morals.<br>
<br>In order to have a correct estimate of the condition of the common Jews and 
their religious leaders, one should study the criticisms leveled by Prophet 
Jesus on them in his sermons contained in the four Gospels. Even a religious man 
like Prophet John was beheaded before their eyes and not a voice was raised in 
protest against this barbarity. Then all the religious leaders of the community 
unanimously demanded death sentence for Prophet Jesus, and none but a few 
righteous men were there to mourn this depravity. Above all, when Pontius Pilate 
asked these depraved people, ' which condemned prisoner he should release, 
according to the custom, at Passover, Jesus or Barabbas the robber', they all 
cried with one voice 'Barabbas'. This was indeed the last chance Allah gave to 
the Jews, and then their fate was sealed.<br><br>Not long after this, a serious 
conflict started between the Jews and the Romans, which developed into an open 
revolt by the former between A.D. 64 and G6. Both Herod Agrippa II and the Roman 
procurator Floris failed to put down the rebellion. At last, the Romans crushed 
it by a strong military action and in A.D. 70 Titus took Jerusalem by force. 
About 1,33,000 people were put to the sword, 67 thousand made slaves, and 
thousands sent to work in the Egyptian mines and to other cities so that they 
could be used in amphitheaters for being torn by wild beasts or become the 
"practice-target" for the sword fighters. All the tall and beautiful girls were 
picked out for the army of conquest and the Holy City of Jerusalem and the 
Temple were pulled down to the ground. After this the Jewish influence so 
disappeared from Palestine that the Jews could not regain power for two thousand 
years, and the Holy Temple could never be rebuilt.. Afterwards the Roman 
Emperor, Hadrian, restored Jerusalem but renamed it Aelia. The Jews, however, 
were not allowed to enter it for centuries. This was the calamity that the Jews 
suffered on account of their degeneration for the second time.<br><br>10Though 
this admonition has been given as a parenthesis at the end of the address to the 
children of Israel, it does not mean that this and the address itself are solely 
meant for them. As a chatter of fact, the whole address is really directed 
towards the disbelievers of Makkah but, instead of addressing them directly, 
some important historical events from the history of the children of Israel have 
been cited in order to serve as admonition for them.<br><br>11This means to warn 
those persons or people or nations who do not take a lesson from the admonitions 
of the Qur'an to be ready to undergo that chastisement which Israelites had to 
suffer.<br><br>12This is in answer to the foolish demands of the disbelievers of 
Makkah who repeatedly demanded from the Holy Prophet to bring about that torment 
with which he threatened them. It is closely connected with the preceding verse, 
as if to say, "O foolish people instead of asking goodness you demand the 
torment: can't you realize the sufferings of the community which is visited by 
God's torment?"<br><br>It also contains a subtle warning to those Muslims who 
prayed for punishment for those disbelievers who persecuted them and rejected 
the Message obdurately; there were still among those disbelievers many such 
people who afterwards embraced Islam and became its standard bearers in the 
world. That is wiry Allah says, "Man does so because he is very hasty and 
impatient; " He prays to Allah for all such things as are the immediate need of 
the time, though often subsequent experience shows that if Allah had granted his 
prayer, it would have been very harmful to him.<br><br>13Allah invites man to 
study the wisdom that underlies variety in the world and not get confused and 
long for monotonous uniformity. In fact, the whole system is based on variety, 
distinctiveness and diversity in things. For the sake of illustration let us 
take the case of the signs of day and night: "You see these underlying opposite 
things daily in your life. If you just consider the underlying wisdom, you will 
find that without this variety there would have been hardly any activity in the 
world. Likewise great wisdom lies in the creation of the people with different 
temperaments, thoughts and inclinations. If Allah had made all men righteous by 
birth or annihilated disbelievers and wicked people and left only believers and 
submissive people in the world, the purpose of men's creation could not leave 
been realized. Therefore, . it is wrong to desire that there should only be day 
and no night. The righteous thing is that these people, who have got the light 
of guidance, should exert their utmost to remove the darkness of deviation. It 
is their duty that if they find darkness like that of night, they should pursue 
it like the sun so that the light of guidance should re-appear."<br><br>14"We 
have fastened the augury of every man to his own neck": therefore one does not 
need to take omens from a bird. : This is to remove the superstition of the 
disbelievers who used to take omens from birds etc., as if to say, "The causes 
and consequences of good fortune or bad fate exist in man's own person. He 
merits good fortune because of his own good conduct and good judgment, and 
likewise, suffers the consequences of evil fate by the lack of these". This was 
necessitated because foolish people always try to attribute their misfortunes to 
external causes, when in fact our fate depends on our own deeds, good or bad. If 
they probe into the causes, they will find that their fate was decided by their 
own good or bad qualities and judgments.<br><br>15This is to impress that if a 
person adopts the right way, he does not do any favor to God or His Messenger or 
a reformer but he himself gets its benefits. On the other hand, if a person 
deviates from the right way, he can do no harm to God or His Messenger or a 
reformer, for they desire only to protect men from wrong ways and guide him on 
to the Right Way, and not for any selfish ends. Therefore, the right course for 
a wise man is to adopt the righteous way, when it becomes distinct to him what 
is truth and what is falsehood. On the other hand, if he rejects Truth because 
of his prejudices and self-interest, he will be his own enemy and not a 
well-wisher.<br><br>16The Qur'an has laid great stress on the doctrine of 
personal responsibility at several places, for one cannot follow the Right Way 
scrupulously without understanding fully its implication. It means that, 
everyone is solely responsible for one's moral conduct and is accountable to God 
as an individual in one's own person and no other person can share the burden of 
responsibility with him. As an instance, we they take the case of a particular 
action or a particular way of conduct in which a generation or a community or a 
large number of people had collaborated. When the people will assemble before 
Allah on the Day of Judgment their collective action will be analyzed so as to 
lay the burden of its responsibility on each and every person who had been 
conducive to it, and rewarded or punished in accordance with it. Neither will a 
person be punished for. the part another had played in its performance nor shall 
the burden of the sin of one individual laid on the shoulders of another. This 
doctrine has been emphasized over and over again so that a wise man should not 
act in imitation of another or justify Iris own conduct by similar deeds of 
others. If a particular person feels the sense of his own responsibility, he 
will act in such a way as to come out successful on the Day of Judgment, 
regardless of what the others do.<br><br>17This is another doctrine which has 
been impressed on the minds by the Quran in different ways. This is to emphasize 
the basic importance that a Messenger has in the dispensation of Divine justice 
because this is determined in the light of the Message brought by him. This will 
be employed as an argument in favor of or against the concerned people. 
Otherwise the infliction of punishment on the people would be unjust for in that 
case they could argue that they should not be punished as the knowledge of the 
righteous way had not been conveyed to them. But after the Message had been 
conveyed to a particular people, and they had rejected it, there would be left. 
no excuse for them.<br><br>It is an irony that instead of accepting the Message 
some foolish people are misled by reading verses like these and they ask such 
absurd questions: "What will be the position of those, who might not have 
received the message of any Prophet?" The wise course for such persons would 
have been to ask themselves what their own position will be on the Day of 
Judgment, because they themselves had received the Message. As regards other 
people, Allah knows best who has received the Message, and when, how and to what 
extent and what attitude a certain person adopted towards it. In short, Allah 
alone is aware of whether a particular person received the Message in such a way 
as to fulfill the required condition for punishment.<br><br>18Here a definite 
form of Divine procedure for the destruction of a people has been stated. When 
the well-to-do people of a habitation become disobedient, it is a portent that 
it is doomed to destruction. After their persistent and continuous 
transgression, the well-to-do people become so obdurate in their disobedience 
that they begin to discard the instinctive dictates of their conscience. The 
same thing has been stated in v. 16: "When We decree that a habitation should be 
destroyed We give Commands to its well-to-do people and they show disobedience." 
This is because Allah has created conscience for the guidance of man. Therefore, 
the dictates of conscience are really the commands of Allah. Thus it has become 
quite obvious that by "When We decree that a habitation should be destroyed" is 
not meant that Allah intends to destroy it without any reason. It is destroyed 
because after their disobedience "that habitation incurs Our just wrath and We 
totally exterminate it." The habitation deserves such a punishment because its 
common people follow the well-to-do people who are the factual leaders of a 
community and are mainly responsible for the corruption of the community. At 
first the well-to-do people commit acts of disobedience, wickedness, mischief, 
cruelty and tyranny and then the common people follow them and incur the torment 
of Allah. Incidentally, this is a warning for every community that it should be 
very discreet and prudent in choosing and electing its leaders and rulers, for 
if the latter are mean and wicked, they will inevitably lead the community to 
destruction.<br><br>19The Arabic word Ajilah literally means something which can 
be had immediately, but the Qur'an employs it as a term for "This World" which 
yields its advantages and results in this worldly life. Its antonym is Akhirat 
(Hereafter) which will yield its advantages and results after death in the life 
of the Next World.<br><br>20The person who does not believe in the life of the 
Hereafter deserves Hell, because he strives only for the successes and good 
things of this world and his endeavors are confined to material objects. 
Consequently, such a person becomes a mere worshiper of this world and adopts 
wrong conduct, for he has no sense of personal responsibility and accountability 
to God and ultimately deserves the torment of Hell.<br><br>21"His endeavors will 
be appreciated": he will be rewarded for the efforts he had made for success in 
the Hereafter.<br><br>22Allah gives the provisions of this world both to those 
who strive for this world and to those who strive for the Hereafter, but it is 
the gift of Allah alone and not of anyone else. It does not lie in the power of 
the worshipers of the world to deprive the seekers after the Hereafter of these 
provisions: nor have the seekers after the Hereafter any power to withhold these 
provisions from the worshipers of the world.<br><br>23This is to show that the 
seekers after the Hereafter have been exalted over the worshipers of the world 
even in this worldly life. However, this exaltation is not in regard to the good 
things of this world -rich food and dress, palatial dwellings, limousines, 
helicopters and other grand things, but it is from another point of view. They 
enjoy that true honor, love and good-will which is denied to the tyrants and the 
rich people in spite of the fact that they may be indigent. This is because 
whatever the seekers after the Hereafter get in this world, it is earned in 
righteous and honest ways, while the worshipers of the world amass wealth by 
employing dishonest and cruel ways. Then the former spend what they get with 
prudence and righteousness. They fulfill the obligations they owe to others. 
They spend their money in the Way of Allah and to please Allah on the needy .and 
the indigent. In contrast to them, the worshipers of this world spend their 
money in .the enjoyment of luxuries, wicked works, corruption and spreading 
other evil things. This makes the former models of God-worship and purity in 
every respect and distinguishes them so clearly, from the worshipers of the 
world that they shine in exaltation over the latter. These things clearly 
indicate that in the next world the grades of the seekers after the Hereafter 
will be far greater and their superiority far higher than those of the 
worshipers of the world.<br><br>24Or it can be rendered like this: "Do not 
invent another deity besides Allah", or "Do not set up another as a deity beside 
Allah."<br><br>25In the succeeding verses, those main basic principles have been 
put forward on which Islam desires to build the whole structure of human life. 
These form, so to say, the Manifesto of the Invitation of the Holy Prophet 
declared by him at the end of the Makki stage of his mission, on the eve of the 
new stage at AI-Madinah so that it should be known to all that the new Islamic 
Society and State were going to be built on such and such ideological, moral, 
cultural economic and legal principles. (Please also refer to vv. 151-153 and 
E.N.'s thereof of Chapter VI).<br><br>26This commandment is very comprehensive. 
It prohibits not only the worship of anyone except Allah but also implies that 
one should obey and serve and submit to Allah alone without question: one should 
accept His Commandments and Law alone to be worthy of obedience and His 
authority to be supreme above all. This was not merely an instruction confined 
to a religious creed and individual practice but it served as the foundation of 
the moral, cultural, and political system which was practically established in 
Al-Madinah by the Holy Prophet. Its first and foremost principle was that Allah 
alone is the Master, Sovereign and Law-giver. <br><br>27This verse enjoins that 
after Allah's right, the greatest of all the human rights is the right of 
parents: therefore, the children should obey and serve and respect their 
parents. The collective morality of society should make it incumbent on children 
to be grateful and respectful to their parents, they should serve them as they 
nursed and brought them up in their childhood. Above all, this verse is not 
merely a moral recommendation but is the basis of the rights and powers of 
parents the details of which we find in the Books of Hadith and Fiqh. Moreover, 
respectful behavior and obedience to and observance of the rights of parents 
comprise the most important element of the material education and moral training 
in the Islamic Society and civilization. Incidentally, all these things have 
determined for ever the principle that the Islamic State shall make the family 
life sound and secure by laws, administrative regulations and educational policy 
and prevent its disintegration.<br><br>28These three articles (3-5) are meant to 
impress that a man should not reserve his earnings and his wealth exclusively 
for his own person. He should do his utmost to fulfill his own necessities of 
life in a moderate way and render the rights of his relatives, neighbors and 
other needy persons as well. This attitude will help create the spirit of 
cooperation, sympathy and justice in the collective Islamic life. Thus every 
relative will cooperate with the other and every well-to-do person will help the 
needy in Iris neighborhood and a wayfarer would find himself an honorable guest 
among generous hosts. The conception of rights should be so extensive that every 
person should consider that all other human beings have rights on his person and 
his property so that he should serve them with the idea that he is rendering 
their rights and is not doing any favor to them. In that case one would beg 
pardon of the other if one was unable to serve him and would pray to God to send 
his blessings upon him to enable him to serve His servants.<br><br>These 
articles of the Islamic Manifesto were not merely confined to moral teachings 
but these formed the basis of the Commandments of Zakat and voluntary charity. 
The laws of inheritance and of making will and endowments were based on these 
articles. The rights of the orphans were determined by these and it was made 
obligatory on every habitation to entertain a wayfarer gratis for at least three 
days. Subsequently the whole moral system was formed so as to create the 
feelings of generosity, sympathy and cooperation. So much so that the people 
began to realize the importance of and observe voluntarily the moral rights 
which could neither be demanded legally nor enforced by law.<br><br>29"Do not 
tie your hand to your neck" is the 'literal translation of the Text which means: 
"Do not be parsimonious" ; "nor stretch it without any restraint" means, "Do not 
be extravagant" . If verses 27 and 29 are read together, it becomes obvious that 
the Qur'an desires the people to follow the golden mean, i.e., they should 
neither be so parsimonious as to prevent the circulation of wealth nor so 
extravagant as to destroy their own economy. On the contrary, they should learn 
to behave in a balanced manner so that they should spend money wherever it 
should be spent and refrain from becoming spendthrifts so as to involve 
themselves into trouble. As a matter of fact, it is ingratitude towards Allah's 
favor to spend money for the sake of show, luxury and sinful acts and similar 
things which are neither man's real necessities nor useful. Therefore, those 
people who spend money lavishly on such things as these are the brethren of 
Satan<br><br>These clauses coo, are not merely meant to be moral instructions 
for individuals. They are intended to safeguard the Islamic Society against 
extravagance by moral instruction, collective pressure and legal restrictions. 
Accordingly, in the Islamic State of Al-Madinah practical steps were taken to 
safeguard the community against extravagance. First, many forms of extravagance 
and luxury were forbidden by law. Secondly, legal measures were taken against 
it. Thirdly. social reforms were introduced to put an end to those customs which 
involved extravagance. The Government was empowered to prevent people from the 
obvious forms of extravagance. Above all, Zakat and voluntary charity helped to 
break parsimony and the lust of hoarding money. Besides these measures, a public 
opinion was created that enabled the people to discriminate between generosity 
and extravagance and thrift and parsimony: so much so that parsimonious people 
were looked down upon as ignominious and the thrifty people were regarded as 
honorable. This moral and mental attitude became a part and parcel of the Muslim 
society, and even today the parsimonious people and boarders are looked down 
upon in the Muslim society, while the generous people are respected everywhere.<br>
<br>30That is, "Man cannot realize the wisdom of the disparity of wealth among 
the people" : therefore, man should not try to interfere by artificial means 
with the natural distribution of wealth. It is wrong to level down natural 
inequality or to aggravate it by artificial means so as to make it unjust. Both 
the extremes are wrong. The best economic system is that which is established on 
the Divine Way of the division of wealth.<br><br>As a result of the realization 
of the wisdom of economic disparity, no such problems arose which might have 
made that disparity an evil in itself so as to demand the creation of a 
classless society. On the contrary, in the righteous society established at Al-Madinah 
on these Divine principles which are akin to human nature, the economic 
differences were not artificially disturbed. But by means of moral and legal 
reforms these became the means of many moral, spiritual and cultural blessings 
and benefits instead of becoming the means of injustice. Thus, the wisdom of the 
disparity created by the Creator of the Universe was practically demonstrated at 
Al-Madinah. <br><br>31This verse cuts at the very root of the movement of birth 
control, which has been going on from ancient times to our present age. It was 
the fear of want that induced people to kill their children or resort to 
abortion. In our age another plan has been added to these, i.e., contraception. 
This article of the Islamic Manifesto prohibits the people from reducing the 
number of mouths by artificial means taut exhorts them to increase the means of 
production according to the natural methods enjoined by .Allah. According to 
this article, it is one of the biggest mistakes of man to check birth rate as a 
solution to the want and scarcity of provisions: therefore, it warns him, as if 
to say, "O man, it is not you who make arrangement for food, but Allah, Who 
settled you in the land and has been providing for you and will provide for 
those who will come after you". History tells us that the food resources have 
always expanded in proportion to the number of inhabitants of a country: nay, 
often they have exceeded far snore than the needs of the inhabitants. Thus it is 
a folly on the part of man to interfere with the arrangements of Allah.<br><br>
It is very significant that as a result of this teaching no movement has ever 
been started to control birth nor has there been any inclination to infanticide 
among the Muslims ever since the revelation of the Qur'an.<br><br>32"Do not even 
go near fornication." This commandment is meant both for individuals and society 
as a whole. It warns each individual not only to guard against adultery or 
fornication itself but against all those things that lead to or stimulate it. As 
regards society as a whole the commandment enjoins it to make such arrangements 
as prevent adultery and eradicate the means and stimulants that lead to 
adultery. Therefore, the society should employ all those legal and educative 
means that help develop such an environment as prevents and eradicates 
indecency.<br><br>Finally, this article formed the basis of laws and regulations 
of the Islamic system of life. In order to fulfill its implications adultery and 
false accusation of adultery were made criminal offenses: regulations about 
"Purdah" were promulgated: the publication of indecent things was banned and 
drinking of intoxicants was made unlawful: restrictions on music, dancing and 
pictures which are conducive to adultery were imposed. Then such laws were 
enacted as made marriage easy, and cut at the root of adultery.<br><br>33"Do not 
kill any soul" includes not only the prohibition of the killing of other souls 
but also one's own soul as well for it is also included in the prohibition that 
immediately follows this command. Thus suicide is regarded as heinous a sin as 
murder. Some foolish people object to the prohibition of suicide saying that 
they themselves are the masters of their souls. Therefore, there is nothing 
wrong in killing one's own self or in destroying one's own property. They forget 
that every soul belongs to Allah, and none has any right to destroy it, nay, 
even to abuse it, for this world is a place of trial, where we should undergo 
the test up to the end of our lives in accordance with the will of Allah. It 
does not matter whether our circumstances are favorable or adverse for trial. 
Therefore, it would be wrong to run away from the place of test, not to speak of 
committing such a heinous crime as suicide (which Allah has prohibited) to 
escape it, for it means that the one who commits suicide tries to run away from 
small troubles and ignominies towards greater affliction and eternal torment and 
ignominy.<br><br>34When the Islamic State was established, "killing by right" 
was confined to five cases only: To punish (1) a willful murderer for 
retribution, (2) opponents of the true religion during war, (3) those who 
attempt to overthrow the Islamic system of government, (4) a man or woman guilty 
of adultery and (5) an apostate.<br><br>35We have translated the Arabic word 
"sultan" into "the right of retribution". Here it stands for "a ground for legal 
action". This also lays down the legal principle that in a case of murder, the 
real plaintiff is not the government but the guardian or the guardians of the 
murdered person who are authorized to pardon the murderer or receive blood-money 
instead of taking his life.<br><br>36Transgression in killing would be to kill 
more persons than the murderer or to kill the criminal by degrees with torment 
or to disfigure his dead body or to kill him after receiving blood-money, etc. 
All these things have been forbidden.<br><br>37It has not been defined how 
succor will be given because at the time of its revelation the Islamic State had 
not yet been established. After its establishment it was made clear that a 
guardian was not authorized to enforce retribution by murdering the criminal. 
The Islamic Government alone is legally authorized. to take retribution; 
therefore, succor for justice should be demanded only from it.<br><br>38This 
too, was not merely a moral instruction. When the Islamic State was established, 
legal and administrative methods were adopted to safeguard the rights of 
orphans, the details of which are found in the literature of Hadith and Fiqh. 
Then this principle was extended to cover the cases of all those citizens who 
were unable to safeguard their own rights. The Holy Prophet himself declared, "I 
am the guardian of the one who has no guardian" . And this is the basis of many 
rules and regulations of the Islamic Law. <br><br>39"Fulfillment of pledges" was 
not meant to be merely a moral instruction for individuals but afterwards when 
the Islamic State was established, this became the guiding principle for the 
conduct of all internal; and external affairs by the Muslim Community and the 
Islamic Government.<br><br>40This instruction was not confined to individuals 
only but it has been made a part of the duties of an Islamic Government to 
supervise transactions in the markets and streets to see that exact measures and 
weights are being observed, and prevent their breach and violation by the force 
of law. Afterwards it was made one of the duties of the government to eradicate 
dishonesty in all commercial dealings and economic transactions.<br><br>41That 
is, "Its end will be best in this world and it will be best in the Hereafter." 
It is best in this world because it produces mutual rust between sellers and 
buyers. As a result of this, commerce prospers and there is a general 
prosperity. As regards the Hereafter, there the end depends wholly on honesty, 
piety and fear of God.<br><br>42The meanings of "Do not follow that of which you 
have no knowledge" are very comprehensive. It demands that both in individual 
and collective life, one should not follow mere guess work and presumption 
instead of "knowledge". This instruction covers all aspects of Islamic life, 
moral, legal, political, administrative and applies to science, arts and 
education. It has thus saved the society from numerous evils which are produced 
in human life by following guesswork instead of knowledge. The Islamic moral 
code demands: Guard against suspicion and do not accuse any individual or group 
without proper investigation. In law, it has been made a permanent principle 
that no action should be taken against anyone without proper investigation. It 
has been made unlawful to arrest, beat or imprison anyone on mere suspicion 
during investigation. In regard to foreign relations, the definite policy has 
been laid down that no action should be taken without investigation, nor should 
rumors be set afloat. Likewise in education the so-called sciences based on mere 
guess-work, presumptions and irrational theories have been disapproved. Above 
all, it cuts at the very root of superstitions, for this instruction teaches the 
Believers to accept only that which is based on the knowledge imparted by Allah 
and His Messenger. <br><br>43This instruction warns against the ways of tyrants 
and vain people and is not merely meant for the individual but also for the 
collective conduct of the Muslim Community. It was because of this guidance that 
the rulers, governors and commanders of the Islamic State which was established 
on the basis of this Manifesto, were free from every tinge of tyranny, 
arrogance, haughtiness, pride and vanity, so much so that even in the 
battlefield they never uttered a word which had the slightest indication of any 
of these vain things. Their gait, dress, dwelling and conveyance showed 
humility. In short, their ways of conduct were not those of "big ones" but those 
of humble persons. That is why they never tried to overawe the people of a 
conquered city by show of pomp and pride.<br><br>44That is, "Allah disapproves 
of the commission of anything that has been prohibited" or, in other words, "He 
disapproves of disobedience to any of these Commandments."<br><br>45Though this 
has been addressed to the Holy Prophet, the real addressee is every human being 
as in the case of many such verses.<br><br>46Please refer to verses 57-59 and 
their E.N's. <br><br>47That is, "They would have themselves tried their best to 
become masters of the Throne". This is because if there had been more than one 
partners in Godhead, it would produce one of the two results: (1) If they were 
all independent gods, it was not conceivable that they would agree and 
co-operate with one another in the management of the boundless universe and 
there could never have been unanimity, uniformity and balanced proportion in its 
functioning. There would have been conflict at every step and everyone would 
have tried to dominate others in order to become its sole master. or (2) if one 
of them had been the supreme god and the others his obedient servants whom he 
had delegated some of his powers, then, according to the maxim "power corrupts", 
they would never have been content with remaining obedient servants of the 
supreme god and would have conspired to become the supreme god themselves.<br>
<br>Whereas the fact is that in this universe not even a grain of wheat or a 
blade of grass can grow unless and until everything in the earth and the heavens 
cooperate with one another for its production. Therefore, only an utterly 
ignorant and block headed person can conceive that there are more than one 
independent or semi-independent rulers, who carry on the management of this 
universe. Anyone who has tried to understand the nature and functioning of the 
universe will most surely arrive at the conclusion that there is One and only 
One Sovereign ruling over this universe, and there is absolutely no likelihood 
of any one else to be a co-partner in this at any stage.<br><br>48That is, "The 
whole of the universe and everything in it bear witness to the fact that their 
Creator and Guardian is free from each and every fault, defect and weakness, and 
that He is far above this that there should be any partner or associate in His 
Godhead.<br><br>49Everything is not only singing hymns of the glory of its 
Creator but is affording the proof that He is perfect in every respect and 
worthy of all praise. Everything is an embodiment of the proof that its Creator 
and Administrator is the one in whom there is perfection of every quality. 
Therefore, He alone is worthy of praise.<br><br>50That is, "It is due to His 
forbearance and forgiveness that though you are persistently insolent to Him and 
go on inventing one false thing or the other against Him, He forbears and 
forgives you,. He neither withholds provisions from you nor deprives you of His 
favors nor strikes an insolent person instantly dead with a thunderbolt. Above 
all, He is so forbearing and forgiving that He gives long enough respite to the 
individuals and communities to mend their ways, sends His prophets and reformers 
for their admonition and guidance and forgives all the past mistakes and errors, 
if one sincerely repents and adopts the Right way.<br><br>51This refers to the 
Divine law according to which those people, who do not believe in the Hereafter, 
cannot benefit from the Qur'an. Allah has attributed this law to Himself, as if 
to say, "The natural result of disbelief in the Hereafter is that the heart of 
such a man becomes dull and his ears become deaf to the Message of the Qur'an, 
for Qur'an bases its invitation on the belief in the Hereafter. So it warns the 
people that they should not be deluded by this apparent aspect of the worldly 
life if there appears to be none to call them to account here; for it does not 
mean they are not at all accountable and answerable to anyone. Likewise if Allah 
allows freedom of belief to practice shirk, atheism, disbelief or Tauhid with 
impunity in this world, and their practice does not appear to make any practical 
difference in this world, it does not mean that these things do not produce any 
results at all. For, in fact, everyone shall be accountable and answerable but 
after death in the Next World. Then every one will realize that the doctrine of 
Tauhid alone is true and all other doctrines are false. For, if at present the 
consequences of deeds do not appear after death they shall inevitably appear, 
but now the Reality has been hidden behind an invisible curtain. There is an 
inevitable moral law according to which submission to it will bear its fruit and 
disobedience shall incur its losses. As decisions according to this moral law 
will be made in the Hereafter, you should not be enticed by the charms of this 
transitory life. You should, therefore, keep in view that ultimately you shall 
have to render an account of all your deeds in this world before your Lord, and 
adopt that true creed and moral attitude which may be conducive to your success 
in the Hereafter."<br><br>From this it must have become obvious that if a man 
does not believe in the Hereafter, he will never consider the message of the 
Qur'an worth his while but will hanker after this world and its joys which he 
can feel and experience. Naturally his ears will not listen to the Message and 
it will never reach the depths of his heart. Allah has stated this psychological 
fact in this verse.<br><br>In this connection, it should be remembered that the 
words contained in this verse were uttered by the disbelievers of Makkah as 
quoted in verse 5 of Surah 41: "They say, O Muhammad, a covering has fallen over 
our hearts, and our ears are deaf for the Message you give and there is a 
curtain between you and us. You may go on with your work and we will do whatever 
we desire." Here the same words have beer cited, as if to say, "You consider 
this state of yours to be a virtue, whereas this is a curse which has fallen on 
you according to the Divine Law because of your disbelief of the Hereafter."<br>
<br>52That is, "They do not like it at all that you should consider Allah alone 
as your Lord and not mention the Lords they have set up. " They seem to think it 
strange that one should go on praising Allah and never mention the "miracles" of 
their elders and saints nor praise them for their favors. For, according to 
them, Allah has delegated the powers of His Godhead to their great ones. 
Therefore, they say, "What a strange fellow he is! He believes that the 
knowledge of the unknown, and all the power and authority belong to One Allah 
alone. Why does he not pay tribute to those who give us children, cure us of 
diseases, and help make our commerce flourish, in short, fulfill all our wishes 
and desires?"<br><br>53This refers to those devices which they conspired against 
the Message of the Holy Prophet. They would secretly listen to him, and then 
hold consultations in order to counteract this. Sometimes it so happened that 
they suspected that someone had been influenced by the Qur'an. Then they would 
sit together and try to dissuade him, saying, "How is it that you have been 
influenced by a person who himself is bewitched by some enemy and talks like 
this?"<br><br>54This is to say that they expressed different opinions at 
different times which contradicted each other. Sometimes they said, "You are a 
sorcerer" and at other times, "You have been bewitched by someone, or you are a 
poet or you are possessed of some evil spirit." These contradictory things were 
a proof that they did not know the reality. Otherwise, they would not have 
invented a different name to suit each occasion. This also shows that they 
themselves were not sure of the `charge' they leveled against him. If they 
called him by one epithet one day, they themselves felt afterwards that it did 
not fit in. Then they would invent the second epithet and then the third and so 
on. Thus every new epithet contradicted the previous ones and showed that there 
was no truth in them, but in their enmity they were inventing one falsehood 
after the other.<br><br>55"They will shake their heads at you" in astonishment 
or to express doubt or disapproval or to scoff at you.<br><br>56That is, "You 
will feel as if the intervening period between death and coming again to life on 
the Day of Resurrection was only a few hours or so, for you will think that you 
had just woken up after a short sleep by the sudden noise produced on the Day."<br>
<br>As regards "......you will rise up praising Him," it is a subtle hint 
towards a great reality: at the time of rising up from death both the believer 
and the unbeliever will be uttering the praise of Allah. The believer will do so 
because in the worldly life also he believed in this creed and practiced it. As 
regards the unbeliever, he will have the urge to do so because of the inherent 
and ingrained tendency in him which he had been suppressing by his folly. In the 
new life all those deliberate suppressions will vanish away and he will 
involuntarily utter the praise of Allah.<br><br>57"The believers."<br><br>58The 
believers have been enjoined to say only the best things even in their 
discussion with the disbelievers and other opponents of their Faith. They should 
neither use harsh words nor make exaggerated statements. They should be cool in 
their conversation and say only what is true and dignified in spite of the 
provoking behavior of the opponents.<br><br>59The believers have been forewarned 
to guard against the provocations of Satan, as if to say, "While answering your 
opponents, if you feel that you are being aroused to anger, you should at once 
understand that it is Satan who is exciting you in order to do harm to your 
dispute, in which he wants to engage human beings for sowing discord between 
them."<br><br>60This is to warn the believers to refrain from making claims of 
piety so as to assign Paradise to themselves and Hell to their opponents. It is 
Allah alone Who has the power to decide these things because He is fully aware 
of the known and secret and the present and future things about all human 
beings. It is He Who will decide whether to show mercy to anyone or give 
chastisement. However, a man may say in the light of the Divine Book that a 
certain kind of human beings deserve mercy and another kind of people incur 
chastisement but none has any right to say specifically that a particular man 
will be given chastisement and another will get salvation.<br><br>61This is to 
declare that a Prophet is sent to convey the Message and not to decide whether a 
person will receive mercy or get chastisement. It does not, however, mean that, 
God forbid, the Holy Prophet himself did such a thing and Allah had to warn him. 
In fact, this is to warn the Muslims that when the Prophet himself is not in a 
position as to decide the fates of the people, they should never think of such a 
thing as to assign Paradise and Hell to anyone.<br><br>62Though this has 
apparently been addressed to the Holy Prophet, in fact the real addressees arc 
the disbelievers of Makkah. This is to rebuke them for the low opinion they held 
in regard to the Holy Prophet. As it commonly happens contemporaries, in 
general, and opponents, in particular, do not see anything great and noble in a 
person of their own time. The same was the case with the contemporaries of the 
Holy Prophet who could not see anything extraordinary or great in him. He 
appeared to be merely a common man of their habitation. On the other hand, they 
were full of praise in regard to the famous personalities who had lived in the 
past few centuries and imagined them to be the perfection of greatness. That is 
why, they raised frivolous objections against his claim to Prophethood, as if to 
say, "Look at this man who considers himself to be a Prophet whereas he cannot 
stand in comparison with the former great Prophets who are held in high esteem 
by all. " Allah has answered their objection, as if to say, "We are fully aware 
of all Our creatures in the heavens and the earth, and We know their ranks but 
you do not know. We know whom to favor with Prophethood, as We have been 
favoring the former Prophets and exalting some Prophets above others in rank."<br>
<br>63It appears that Prophet David has been particularly mentioned to show that 
Prophethood does pot mean that one should have nothing to do with the life of 
this world. This was the answer to the objection they were raising against the 
claim to Prophethood by Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), that he was a man 
of the world. It means to say, "Though David was a king who had to engage 
himself in worldly affairs more than a common man, he was favored by Allah with 
Prophethood, and given the Book, the Psalms. Likewise Muhammad (Allah's peace be 
upon him) could be favored with Prophethood in spite of the fact that he had 
wife and children and passed his life like other common people and was engaged 
in buying and selling in the market, in short, in performing all those duties 
that a man of the world has to perform to meet his necessities of life. This was 
necessitated because according to the disbelievers of Makkah, such a man of the 
world could not be considered to be even a pious man, much less a Prophet, for 
pious people should have nothing to do with the worldly affairs but should sit 
in seclusion and remember God whereas the Holy Prophet had to work to fulfill 
the necessities of life.<br><br>64This warning helps to elaborate the Doctrine 
of Tauhid and negate shirk. According to this, shirk is not confined merely to 
falling prostrate before any other than Allah but it is also shirk to pray to or 
invoke the help of any other than Allah; for praying to or calling for help any 
other than Allah is in reality a kind of worship. Therefore, the one who invokes 
for help any other than Allah is as much guilty of shirk as the worshiper of an 
idol. This verse also shows clearly that none other than Allah has any power to 
attend to prayers and relieve any one of trouble or alter any one's bad 
condition. Hence, if one believes that some one other than Allah has any power, 
he shall be guilty of shirk.<br><br>65The words of the text are a clear proof 
that the deities and the helpers referred to in this verse were not idols of 
stone but were either angels or dead saints. It is clearly implied in this that 
no prophet, no saint and no angel, whom the people invoke for help, has the 
power to hear prayers and help anyone. They themselves hope for mercy from Allah 
and dread His punishment and vie with one another in seeking means for nearness 
to Him.<br><br>66This is to remove the delusion of the disbelievers that their 
habitations were immune from danger or chastisement. This verse warns that every 
habitation will be destroyed as a matter of course or by Allah's chastisement.<br>
<br>67Here "Signs" mean those visible miracles which are presented as a proof of 
Prophethood. The disbelievers from among the Quraish were demanding such Signs 
over and over again.<br><br>68This is to warn the disbelievers, as if to say, 
"It is the mercy of Allah that He is not showing such a Sign so that you might 
mend your ways but in your folly you presume that such a Sign cannot be 
presented. You should know that a Sign is not being sent because its denial 
inevitably brings chastisement and the community is annihilated. You can learn 
from the past History that those communities which disbelieved in the open Signs 
were utterly destroyed, such as the people of Thamud.<br><br>69That is, 
"Miracles are not shown for fun. These are meant to warn the people that the 
Prophet is being helped by the Almighty and that they should realize the 
terrible consequences of disobedience."<br><br>70That is, "At the very beginning 
of your Prophethood, when the disbelievers of the Quraish had started opposition 
to your message, We declared that We are encircling them. They might try their 
worst to obstruct your Message, but they will inevitably fail in this and your 
Mission will succeed in the teeth of opposition. Can't they see that this 
declaration has come out true as a miracle, for their opposition has failed to 
hinder your Message, and they have not been able to do any harm to you at all ? 
This was a clear Sign of the fact that the Mission of the Holy Prophet was being 
supported by the Almighty God."<br><br>As regards the declaration that Allah is 
encircling the disbelievers and helping he mission of the Prophet, it occurs in 
several Surahs of the first stage of Prophethood at Makkah. For instance, in vv. 
17-20 of LXXV, Allah says, "These disbelievers do not learn a lesson from the 
stories of the people of the Pharaoh and Thamud but are rejecting the Message 
here as Allah is encircling them on all sides."<br><br>71This refers to Mi`raj 
(Ascension) for here word "ru'ya " does not mean "seeing things in a dream" but 
seeing things actually with physical eyes. It is quite obvious that if it had 
been a mere "dream" and the Holy Prophet had presented it as a dream to the 
disbelievers, there was no reason why it should have become a trial for them. 
Everyday people see strange dreams and relate them to the people but these 
dreams never become such a curious thing as to make people scoff at the dreamer 
and accuse him of making a false claim or of being a mad person.<br><br>72This 
cursed tree, Az-Zaqqum " which has been mentioned in vv 43-4 of Surah XLIV, 
grows at the bottom of Hell and its dwellers shall have to eat it. This has been 
called a cursed tree because it is not given to people to eat as a mercy from 
Allah but as a symbol of His curse so that the accursed people should eat it and 
get more sore, for this will, so to speak, burn in their bellies like the 
boiling water.<br><br>73That is, We showed you such things during the Mi'raj so 
that they should have the first hand knowledge of the Reality from a truthful 
and honest man like you and be warned by it to the Right Way. They, however, 
began to make fun of you, though We had already warned them through you that 
their evil ways would force them to eat of the Az-Zaqqum. Instead of this they 
began to scoff at you, saying, Just consider the logic of this man: on the one 
hand, he says that there an awful fire burning in Hell and, on the other, he 
says that trees are growing in it."<br><br>74Please also refer to II: 30-39, IV: 
117-122, VII: 11-25, XIV: 22, XV:26-43<br><br>This story has been cited here to 
impress upon the disbelievers that their attitude of arrogance and indifference 
towards Allah is exactly the same as was adopted by Satan; As a matter of fact, 
they were following Satan who is the avowed enemy of man, and were being 
entangled in the snare spread by him who had challenged the progeny of Adam at 
the very beginning of human history that he would allure and ruin them.<br><br>
75That is, "I will uproot them from the high position of Divine Vicegerency 
which demands steadfastness in obedience. Their removal from that high position 
is just like the tearing of a tree from its roots."<br><br>76The literal meaning 
of the Arabic Text is, "You may sweep away those whom you find superficial and 
weak-minded."<br><br>77Here, Satan has been likened to that robber who assaults 
a habitation with horsemen and footmen, and orders one to rob this thing add the 
other to plunder that thing and so on-The horsemen and the footmen of Satan are 
those jinns and human beings who are engaged in numerous forms and positions in 
carrying out his mission.<br><br>78This is a very meaningful sentence which 
depicts a true and perfect picture of the relationship between Satan and his 
followers. On the one hand, Satan becomes a partner with the one who follows him 
in the earning and spending of his money without putting in any labor in it; on 
the other, he does not become a partner in bearing the consequences of his 
error, crime and sin. But his foolish dupe follows his instructions as if he 
were a partner, nay, a stronger party. Again in regard to the children of such a 
man, the father himself bears the whole burden of bringing them up, but under 
the misguidance of Satan he trains them in wrong and unmoral ways as if he alone 
was not their father but Satan as well was a partner in it.<br><br>79Satan 
entices them with false promises of success and entangles them in the snare of 
false expectations.<br><br>80It has two meanings: (1) "You will have no power 
over human beings to force them to follow your way. What you are allowed to do 
is that you may delude them by false counsel and entice them by false promises, 
but they will have the option to follow or not to follow your counsel. You will 
not have the power over them to force them to follow your way against their 
will. " (2) "You will not succeed in 'alluring My righteous people. Though the 
weak-minded will be enticed by you, My righteous people who are steadfast in My 
obedience will not succumb to you."<br><br>81That is, "Those who will trust in 
Allah and believe in His guidance and help, will not stand in need of any other 
support in their trial by Satan for Allah will guide them, protect them and help 
them to be safe from his allurements. On the other hand, those people, who will 
place their trust in their own power or that of any other than Allah, will not 
come out successful in their trial by Satan."<br><br>82This passage (vv. 66-72) 
is closely connected with the previous one. It tells man that if he wants to 
protect himself from the allurements, temptations and false promises of Satan 
who has been his avowed enemy from the day of his creation, he should recognize 
his real Lord and be steadfast in His obedience. Satan intends to prove that man 
is not worthy of the honor with which Allah has blessed him. Therefore if he 
follows any other way he cannot escape the snares of Satan.<br><br>In this 
passage, arguments of Tauhid have been put forward in order to make man 
steadfast in his Faith and refrain from shirk.<br><br>83That is, "Try to avail 
of the economic, social, educational and intellectual benefits which are 
provided by the sea voyages."<br><br>84That is, "This is a proof of the fact 
that your real nature knows no other Lord than Allah, and you feel in the depths 
of your hearts that He alone possesses the real power of every gain or loss. Had 
it not been so, man would never have invoked Allah at the time when he realized 
that no other helper could remove his misfortune."<br><br>85That is, "It is an 
obvious fact that the superiority man enjoys over all other beings on the Earth 
and all that is in it, has not been bestowed upon him by a jinn or an angel or a 
prophet. Most surely that is Allah's blessing and favor. Is it not then the 
height of folly and ignorance that after having achieved such a high rank, man 
should bow down before any creature of Allah instead of Him?"<br><br>86We learn 
from the Qur'an that on the Day of Resurrection, the righteous people will be 
given their records in their right hands and they will be overjoyed to have a 
look at it and will show it to others. As regards the wicked people, they will 
get their records in their left hands and in their shame will try to hide it 
behind their backs. (Please refer to LXIX: 19-28, LXXXIV: 7-13).<br><br>87In 
order to understand the significance of this verse. we should keep in view the 
circumstances through which the Holy Prophet had been passing at Makkah during 
the preceding decade or so. The disbelievers of Makkah were exerting their 
utmost to turn the Holy Prophet awry, somehow or other, from his Message of 
Tauhid, which he was presenting, and to force him to make a compromise with 
shirk and the customs of ignorance. In order to achieve this end, they tempted 
him in several ways. They practiced deception upon him, and tempted him with 
greed, held out threats, and raised a storm of false propaganda against him, and 
persecuted him and applied economic pressure and social boycott against him. In 
short, they did all that could be done to defeat his resolve.<br><br>88This 
review implies two things: (1) "If you had compromised with falsehood after 
recognizing the Truth, you might have pleased your degenerate people but would 
have incurred the wrath of Allah and would have received double chastisement 
both in this world and in the Hereafter." (2) "No man, not even a Messenger of 
Allah, can fight single-handed against the deceitful methods of falsehood, 
unless he receives the succor of Allah." It was the fortitude which Allah had 
bestowed upon the Holy Prophet, which helped him to retrain steadfast on the 
right position he had taken, so that no persecution, howsoever great, could turn 
him away in the least from that position.<br><br>89This was a clear prophecy 
which was made at the time when it appeared to be no more than a mere threat, 
but it was fulfilled literally in a decade or so. A year after the revelation of 
this Surah, the disbelievers of Makkah compelled the Holy Prophet to Leave his 
home. Then within eight years he entered Makkah as a conqueror, and within two 
years after this, the whole of Arabia was totally freed from mushriks. Then 
whosoever stayed in that country, he remained there as a Muslim and not as a 
mushrik.<br><br>90That is, "This is how Allah has always dealt with the people 
who killed or exiled His Messengers. They never survived in the land after this. 
They were either annihilated by the scourge of Allah or were brought under the 
sway of an enemy or wen subdued by the followers of the Messenger."<br><br>91The 
Muslims have been commanded to establish Salat immediately after the mention of 
obstacles and adversities. This implies that the perseverance required to face 
adverse circumstances is obtained by the establishment of Salat.<br><br>92We 
have translated the words of the Arabic Text into "the declining of the sun." 
Though some of the Companions and their followers are of the opinion that it 
means "the sunset", the majority of them are of the opinion that it means "the 
declining of the sun from its zenith." Caliph 'Umar, Ibn `Umar, Anas bin Malik, 
Abu Barza-tal-Aslami, Hasan Basri, Sha'abi, Ata', Mujahid and, according to a 
Tradition, Ibn `Abbas (Allah be pleased with them all) are of this opinion and 
Imam Muhammad Baqir and Imam Ja`afar Sadiq also are of the same opinion. Besides 
this, there are some Traditions from the Holy Prophet to the same effect, though 
they are not so authentic.<br><br>93According to some, the original words of the 
Arabic text mean "complete darkness of the night", while others take it to mean 
"midnight" If the first opinion is accepted, it will imply the beginning of the 
time of the 'Isha' Prayer and according to the other it will mean "the last 
limit of the time of "Isha."<br><br>94The literal meaning of the word fajr is 
"dawn", that is, "the beginning of the morning after the darkness of night."<br>
<br>Here the "recital of the Qur'an in the morning" stands for the Morning 
Prayer. At some places the Quran has used the word Salat for 'Prayer' and at 
other places a particular part of Salat for Prayer as a whole, e.g., tasbih, 
hamd, zikr, qayam, ruku', sajud etc. Likewise, here "recital of the Qur'an at 
dawn" does not mean the mere recital of the Qur'an but its recital during the 
Prayer. Thus, the Qur'an has also incidentally referred to the different parts 
of which Salat is composed and these guided the Holy Prophet to prescribe the 
definite form of Salat in which it is performed by the Muslims to-day.<br><br>
95The recital of the Qur'an at dawn is witnessed by the angels of Allah to 
testify it, as has been explained in the Traditions. Though the angels witness 
each prayer and each good deed the special mention of their being witnesses at 
the time of the recital of the Qur'an during the Morning Prayer gives it a 
particular Importance. That is why the Holy Prophet used to recite long passages 
from the Qur'an during the Morning Prayer. His example was followed by the 
Companions, and the succeeding Muslim scholars held it to be a desirable thing.
<br>In this verse, it has been briefly stated how to establish Salat which was 
made obligatory on the occasion of Mi `raj at the prescribed timings. It has 
been ordained that the first Prayer is to be offered before the sunrise and the 
remaining four after the declining of the sun till the darkness of the night. 
Afterwards Angel Jibril was sent to the Holy Prophet to define the limits of the 
timings of each Prayer. According to a Tradition of Abu Da'ud and Tirmizi 
related by Ibn 'Abbas, the Holy Prophet said, "Jibril led me in the five Prayers 
twice near the Ka`abah. On the first day, he offered the Dhuhr Prayer just after 
the declining of the sun, when the shadow of everything was the shortest. Then 
he offered the 'Asr Prayer when the shadow of each thing was equal to its own 
length; then the Maghrib Prayer at the time when one breaks one's fast, and the 
'Isha' Prayer was offered just at the time when twilight had disappeared, and 
Faj rPrayer at the time when it becomes unlawful to eat and drink anything for 
the one who intends to observe a Fast. The next day he offered the Dhuhr Prayer 
at the time when the shadow of each thing became equal to its own length and the 
'Asr Prayer when the shadow had doubled. The Maghrib Prayer was offered as on 
the previous day and the Isha' Prayer when one-third of the night had passed 
away, and the Morning Prayer when light had spread all over. After this Jibril 
turned towards me and said. 'O Muhammad, these are the timings of Salat of the 
Prophets and the right tunings are between these two extreme limits."<br><br>The 
Qur'an has also pointed to these five times of Salat on different occasions:<br>
<br>(1) "And listen; establish Salat at the two ends of the day and in the early 
parts of the night..." (IX: 114).<br><br>(2) "...And glorify your Lord with His 
praise before the sunrise (Fajr) and before sunset ('Asr) and then glorify Him 
during the night (`Isha') and then at the ends of the day (Fajr, Dhuhr and 
Maghrib)..." (XX: 130).<br><br>(3) "So glorify Allah when it is evening for you 
(Maghrib), and when it is morning (Fajr). praise is only for Him in the heavens 
and the earth and glorify him in the later part of the afternoon ( 'Asr) and in 
the afternoon (Dhuhr). "(XXX. 17-18).<br><br>There is great wisdom in this 
system of the timings of Salat. One of these is to avoid the timings of the 
worship of the sun-worshipers. This is because the sun has always been in every 
age one of the greatest deities of the mushriks, who worshiped it especially at 
the time of sunrise and sunset. Therefore, these two times have totally been 
forbidden for Salat. Besides this, they worshiped the sun at the time of its 
zenith. That is why Islam has ordained that the Muslims should offer their two 
Prayers during the day-time after the sun has declined and the Fajr Prayer 
before the sunrise. The Holy Prophet himself has stated this wisdom of the 
timings of Prayer in several Traditions. For instance, in the Tradition related 
by 'Amar bin `Abasah, the Holy Prophet is reported to have replied to a qua"soon 
to this effect: "Offer your Morning Prayer, but refrain from it when the sun is 
about to rise until it has risen high. For the sun rises between the horns of 
Satan and the unbelievers fall prostrate before it at that time.<br><br>Then 
after mentioning the `Asr Prayer, he said:<br><br>"After `Asr Prayer, refrain 
from any Prayer until the sunset, for during that time the sun sets between the 
horns of Satan and the unbelievers fall prostrate before it."<br><br>The rising 
and the setting of the sun between the horns of Satan is a symbolic expression 
that has been used in this Tradition. This implies that both these times are 
used by Satan as temptations for the people. This is, as if to say, that Satan 
is so pleased with the worship of the unbelievers at the time of sunrise and 
sunset that he appears to carry the sun on his head as a mark of approval. This 
interpretation of the Tradition is based on this remark of the Holy Prophet: 
"The unbelievers fall prostrate before it."<br><br>96The literal meaning of "Tahajjud" 
is to rise up by breaking sleep. Therefore, the sentence has been translated 
into "Offer Tahajjud Prayer", which means "Rise up from sleep after the passing 
of a part of night and then offer your Prayer."<br><br>97"Nafl" literally means 
"something done in addition to an obligatory duty". This shows that the Tahajjud 
Prayer is in addition to the five prescribed Prayers. <br><br>98"...may exalt 
you to a laudable position" = "You may attain such a high position in this world 
and in the next world that people from everywhere may be full of praise for you, 
and you may become a praiseworthy personality." This is, as if to say, "Now your 
opponents are engaged in calling you names and arc trying to defame you 
throughout the country, and have raised a storm of false accusations against you 
but that time is not far when the world will ring with the echoes of your praise 
and in the Hereafter you will become worthy of praise by all creatures. " The 
exaltation of the Holy Prophet to the high position of intercession on the Day 
of Resurrection is also a part of that "laudable position."<br><br>99This prayer 
clearly shows that the time of Hijrah (Migration) had come near. That is why 
Allah has instructed the Holy Prophet to this effect: You should follow the 
truth wherever and in whatever condition you be. If you migrate from a place, 
you should migrate for the sake of the truth, and wherever you go, you should go 
for the sake of the truth.<br><br>100That is, "Either grant me power and 
authority or make some government my helper so that I may use its power to 
reform the corrupt world. " This is because power is required to check indecency 
and sin and to enforce the law of justice.<br><br>Hasan Basri and Qatadah have 
made the same interpretation of this verse, and the great commentators like Ibn 
Jarir and Ibn Kathir have adopted the same. This is supported by a Tradition of 
the Holy Prophet: "Allah eradicates by the power of government those evils, 
which arc not eradicated by the teachings of the Qur'an." This is a clear proof 
that according to Islam, political power is also required to introduce reform, 
for admonition alone is not enough for this. Besides this, when Allah Himself 
has taught this prayer to His Prophet for the establishment of His Way and 
enforcement of His Law, it is not only lawful but desirable to acquire power and 
those, who consider this to be a worldly thing, are obviously in the wrong. What 
is really "worldliness" is that one should desire and acquire power for one's 
own interest. On the contrary. the desire of power for the sake of Allah's Way 
is not the worship of the world but the worship of God. <br><br>101At the time 
of this declaration, the persecution of the Muslims was at its height. A large 
number of them had emigrated to Habash, and those who had remained behind were 
suffering from untold hardships at Makkah and its suburbs: so much so that the 
life of the Holy Prophet himself was always in danger. Therefore, to all 
appearances, falsehood was prevailing everywhere and there was no sign to show 
that the truth would ever overpower falsehood. That is why the disbelievers took 
it for a boastful talk and scoffed at it when this declaration was trade. But 
this prophecy of victory did come out true in less than a decade when the Holy 
Prophet entered the same city of Makkah as a conqueror, and entered the Ka'abah 
where he made the same declaration while he was breaking the three hundred and 
sixty idols. According to a Tradition of Bukhari, related by Hadrat 'Abdullah 
bin Mas`ud, "On the day of the conquest of Makkah the Holy Prophet went on 
striking idols and uttering these words: “The Truth has come and falsehood has 
vanished; for falsehood is a thing that must by its nature vanish. The Truth has 
come and falsehood will never reappear nor return.”<br><br>102That is, "Those 
people who make the Qur'an their guide and their book of law, are favored with 
the blessing of Allah and arc cured of all their mental, psychological, moral. 
and cultural diseases. On the other hand, those wicked people who reject this 
and turn their back on its guidance, in fact, are unjust to themselves. 
Therefore, the Qur'an does not allow them to remain even in that bad condition 
in which they were before its revelation or its knowledge but involves them in a 
greater loss than before. This is because before the revelation of the Qur'an or 
their acquaintance with it, they suffered from ignorance alone but when the 
Qur'an came before them and made distinct the difference between Truth and 
falsehood, no excuse was left with them to remain in their previous condition 
of. ignorance. After this, if they reject its guidance and persist in their 
deviation, it is a clear proof that they are not ignorant but workers of 
iniquity and worshipers of falsehood, which arc averse to the Truth. For then 
their position is of the one who, when presented both poison and elixir, makes a 
choice of poison. Therefore, they themselves are in that cast fully responsible 
for their deviation and whatever crimes they commit after that, shall incur 
their full punishment. It is obvious that the consequent loss of wickedness must 
be far greater than the loss of ignorance. The Holy Prophet has summed this up 
in this concise and comprehensive sentence: "The Qur'an is either an argument in 
your favor or against you."<br><br>103It is generally understood that the Arabic 
word "Ruh"stands here for "soul"' as if the people asked the Holy Prophet about 
the soul of man in regard to its nature, and the answer was that it came by the 
Command of Allah. But we have great hesitation in accepting this meaning for it 
could be taken only if the verse be isolated from its context; otherwise these 
words would become quite incoherent for there is no reason why the question 
about "soul" should have intervened between the preceding three verses and 
following verses which deal with the theme of the Qur'an.<br><br>If we read the 
verse in its context, it becomes quite obvious that here the word "Ruh" (The 
Spirit) stands for the angel who brings Revelation. This was in answer to the 
question of the mushriks, "Where from do you bring the Qur'an?" as if to say, "O 
Muhammad, these people ask you about "The Spirit', that is, the source of the 
Qur'an or the means of acquiring it", so tell them, "This Spirit comes to me by 
the Command of my Lord but your knowledge is so little that you cannot 
distinguish between the nature of human words and the Divinely revealed words. 
That is why you suspect that this has been fabricated by some man."<br><br>The 
above interpretation is to be preferred, because it fits in excellently between 
the preceding and the succeeding verses. This is also supported by the Qur'an 
itself: " ...He sends down by His Command ` The Spirit" to any of His servants 
He wills so that they should warn the people of the Day, when they shall be 
assembled together." (XL: 15) "And likewise We have sent down "The Spirit' to 
you by Our Command: you did not know what the Book was and what the Faith ..." 
(XLII: 52).<br><br>Besides this, Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and Hasan Basri (may Allah 
bestow His mercy upon them all) have also adopted the same interpretation. Ibn 
Jarir has attributed the same thing to Ibn `Abbas on the authority of Qatadah, 
but at the same time he tells a strange thing that Ibn `Abbas stated this thing 
only in secret. Again the author of Ruh-ul-Ma'ani cites these words of Hasan and 
Qatadah: "By ruh is meant Jibril: the question was about the nature of his 
coming down and inspiring the heart of the Holy Prophet with Revelation."<br>
<br>104Though these words arc apparently addressed by the Holy Prophet, they are 
in fact meant for the disbelievers who considered the Holy Qur'an to be either 
the invention of the Holy Prophet himself or of some other man, who secretly 
taught him the Qur'an. They are being told that this is the Word of Allah, as if 
to say, "Our Prophet has not fabricated the Qur'an but We have bestowed this on 
him, and if We take it back from him, the Prophet has no power to invent such a 
thing nor has any other man the power to help the Prophet to present such a 
miraculous Book."<br><br>105This challenge occurs at several other places in the 
Qur'an: (II: 23, X: 38-39, XL: 13-14, LII: 33-34). At all these places, this has 
been cited as an answer to the charge of the disbelievers that Muhammad (Allah's 
peace be upon him) has himself invented the Qur'an but is presenting it as 
Allah's Word. Besides this, the same has also been refuted in X: 16: “Say also, 
“Had not Allah willed that I should recite the Qur'an to you, I could not have 
recited it to you, nor could I have been able to give you any information about 
it: already have I lived a lifetime among you before its revelation. Do you not 
use your common sense?”<br><br>Now let us turn to the three arguments contained 
in these verses as a proof that the Qur'an is the Word of Allah.<br><br>(1) The 
Qur'an is such a miracle in regard to its language, style, arguments, themes, 
topics, teachings and prophecies that it is beyond any human power to produce 
the like of it, as if to say, "You say that a man has invented this but We 
challenge that even the whole of mankind combined cannot produce a Book like 
this: nay, even if the jinns, whom the mushriks worship as deities and whom this 
Book openly attacks, should come to the help of the disbelievers, they cannot 
produce a Book like this to refute this challenge."<br><br>(2) As regards the 
charge that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) has himself invented this Book, 
the Qur'an refutes their claim, as if to say, "Muhammad is one of you and not a 
foreigner. He has lived among you for forty years before the revelation of the 
Qur'an. Did you ever hear words like those of the Qur'an from him even a day 
before his claim of Prophethood, or did you ever hear him discussing themes and 
problems contained in the Qur'an? If you consider the matter from this point of 
view, it will become obvious to you that the sudden change which has come about 
in the language, ideas, information, style and the way of thinking of Muhammad, 
could not take place without Divine Guidance."<br><br>(3) "Can you not see that 
after the recital of the Qur'an he does not disappear but lives among you? You 
hear other things than the Qur'an from him. Do you not notice that the 
distinction between the two different styles of expression is so obvious that no 
man can successfully adopt the two styles at one and the same time?" The 
distinction can also be noticed, even today, between the language of the Qur'an 
and that of the Traditions of the Holy Prophet. Anyone well-versed in the Arabic 
language and literature notices the difference which is so marked that one can 
categorically say that these modes of expression cannot belong to one and the 
same person. (For further reference please also see E.N. 21 of X 16).<br><br>
106This is the second answer to the demand of the disbelievers for a miracle. 
The first answer is contained in V. 59. The eloquence of this concise answer is 
above praise: "You demand from me that I should cause a spring to gush forth, or 
in the twinkling of an eye should bring into being a garden in full bloom with 
canals flowing in it: or I should cause the heaven to fall into pieces on those 
of you who are rejecting the message: or I should cause to build a furnished 
palace of gold: or I should call Allah and the angels to stand before you and 
testify to this effect: ' We Ourselves have sent down Muhammad as Our Messenger' 
: or I should go up to the sky in your presence and bring down, addressed to 
you, the letter of authority of my appointment duly signed by Allah so that you 
may touch it with your hands and read it with your own eyes. " The concise 
answer to these big demands was this, "My Lord be glorified! Have I ever claimed 
to be anything more than a human Messenger?" It may be expanded like this: "O 
foolish people! have 1 claimed to be God that you are demanding such things from 
me? Did I ever say that I am all-powerful and am ruling over the Earth and the 
Heavens? From the very first day my claim has been that I am a human being who 
is bringing the Message from God. Therefore, if you want to judge the 
authenticity of my claim, you may judge it from my Message. If you are convinced 
that it is based on the Truth and is absolutely rational, then you should 
believe in it without making foolish demands. On the other hand, if you find any 
defect in it, you may reject it. If you want to test whether my claim is based 
on truth, you should judge it by the standard of my conduct and morals as a 
human being and my mission. Is it not a folly that, instead of this, you are 
demanding from me to cleave the earth and cause the sky to fall? Is there any 
connection whatsoever of Prophethood with things like that?"<br><br>107It 
implies that this misunderstanding has always been common among the ignorant 
people of every age that a human being could not be a Messenger of Allah: They 
rejected a Messenger just because he was a human being and took his meals and 
had wife and children like themselves. In contrast to this, after the passage of 
the time the credulous followers of a Messenger began to claim that he was not a 
human being at all because he was a Messenger. That is why some people made 
their Messenger their God, others the son of God and still others the 
incarnation of God. In short, the ignorant people had never been able to 
understand that a human being could be a Messenger of Allah.<br><br>108This is 
to say that Messenger does not merely convey the Message but is sent to reform 
human life in accordance with it. He has to apply the principles of the Message 
to the circumstances of human beings and has himself to demonstrate practically 
those principles. Moreover, he has to remove the misunderstandings of those 
people who try to listen w and understand his Message. Besides this, he has to 
organize and train the Believers to create a society based on the teachings of 
his Message. He has to struggle against those who reject and oppose his Message 
in order to subdue those powers that are bent upon corruption, and bring about 
that reformation for which Allah has sent His Messenger. As all these things 
have to be done in a society of human beings only a human Messenger can perform 
the mission. If an angel had been sent as a Messenger, the most he could have 
done was to convey the message, for he could not live among human beings and 
share their life and problems in order to reform them. It is thus clear that a 
human Messenger only could be suitable for this purpose.<br><br>109That is, 
"Allah is fully aware of all my efforts which I am expending in order to reform 
you, and He is fully aware of the efforts you are making against my mission. His 
witness is sufficient because He will pass the final judgment."<br><br>110In 
this verse, the Qur'an has enunciated a Divine principle. Allah guides to the 
Right Way only that person who intends to follow His Guidance, and lets go 
astray that person who intends W go astray. Thereafter none is able to bring 
back to the Right Way the one against whom Allah has closed the door of guidance 
because of his own persistent deviation and obduracy. It is obvious that if a 
man turns his back against the truth and rests content with falsehoods there is 
no power in the world to make him turn away from falsehood and come to the 
truth.<br><br>This is because after this depravity Allah provides for that 
wicked person such means as increase his aversion to truth and his love for 
falsehood.<br><br>111On the Day of Resurrection, they will be raised up blind, 
dumb and deaf because they behaved like such people in this world and would not 
see the Truth nor listen to the Truth nor speak the Truth.<br><br>112This verse 
also suggests the same thing that has already been mentioned in V . 55. This 
hints at the real psychological reason why the disbelievers of Makkah were not 
inclined to accept Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), their contemporary, as 
a Prophet. For thus they would have to acknowledge his superiority and one does 
not easily acknowledge the superiority of one's contemporary. This verse may be 
expanded like this: "Those people who are so narrow-minded that they are 
unwilling even to acknowledge the real superiority of another, cannot be 
expected to be generous in spending on others, if they possessed the keys of the 
treasures of Allah's blessings."<br><br>113It should be noted that this is the 
third answer to the demand of the disbelievers of Makkah for Signs. They said, 
"We will not believe in you until you do this and do that before our eyes." In 
answer to this demand, they are being warned: "Nine clear Signs, like the ones 
you are demanding, were shown one after the other to Pharaoh before you and you 
also know full well what he said, simply because he did not want to believe in 
Moses; you also know that when he rejected the Prophet, even after seeing the 
Signs, We drowned him."<br><br>The nine Signs mentioned here have also been 
mentioned in VII: 133. These were: (1) The staff which turned into a monster 
snake. (2) Moses' bright hand which shone like the sun. (3) The public defeat of 
the sorcery of the magicians. (4)Universal famine. (5) Storm. (6) Locusts. (7) 
Lice. (8) Frogs. (9) Rain of blood.<br><br>114This has been particularly 
mentioned here because the mushriks of Makkah attributed the same epithet to the 
Holy Prophet as contained in V. 47. "These wrong-doers say to each other, 'The 
man, you are following, is a bewitched person' . "Here they are being warned 
that in this they were following Pharaoh, who gave the same epithet to Prophet 
Moses.<br><br>In this connection, we want to make a brief reference to an 
objection which has been raised by the modernists against a Tradition according 
to which the Holy Prophet once came under the influence of sorcery. They say 
that this Tradition confirms that the epithet "bewitched" applied to the Holy 
Prophet by the Quraish was correct, whereas the Qur'an refutes this as false: 
They forget that the same argument could be applied to the case of Prophet Moses 
whom Pharaoh accused of being bewitched, for the Qur'an says, in XX: 66-67: 
"When the magicians threw down their cords and rods (instruments of their 
sorcery), it seemed to Moses as if they were running, as a result of which Moses 
conceived in his mind a sort of fear. " If the words of the Tradition were to be 
considered against the Qur'an, do not these words of the Qur'an contradict its 
own words that the charge of Moses being bewitched was false? Do these 
modernists consider this verse to confirm Pharaoh's charge?"<br><br>As a matter 
of fact, these objectors do not know the sense in which the disbelievers of 
Makkah and Pharaoh called the Holy Prophet and Prophet Moses (Allah's peace be 
upon them) bewitched. What they meant was that some enemy had so bewitched them 
that they had lost their senses and so in their insanity claimed to be prophets 
and delivered a curious message. The Qur'an refutes this charge as false. As 
regards the temporary influence of magic on same person or a part of him has not 
been denied, for the influence of magic is like the effect produced on a person 
who is hit with a stone. The fact that some prophet was temporarily influenced 
by magic, does not in any way affect his prophethood adversely. Just as poison 
produced its effect on a prophet, or a prophet was wounded, so a prophet could 
also temporarily come under the influence of magic. Such a temporary magic could 
not cause any defect in his prophethood. God forbid, had magic produced any 
adverse effect on his reasoning and thinking faculties, one might have been 
skeptical about the authenticity of the Message. And when Pharaoh and the 
disbelievers of Makkah said that Prophet Moses and the Holy Prophet were 
bewitched, they meant that they had lost their senses under the influence of 
magic. The Qur'an refutes this charge brought against the Prophets.<br><br>
115Moses could say these words categorically that the Signs were from the Lord 
of the Universe because the calamities which visited Egypt could not be brought 
about by magic or by any human device. For it is not possible for any human 
power to bring about frogs over vast areas or to cause all granaries in the land 
to be eaten up by weevils. Then it should also be kept in view that Prophet 
Moses warned beforehand of an impending Sign, warning Pharaoh to give up his 
obduracy, and the calamity did come exactly as he had predicted. In these 
circumstances only a mad or obdurate person could say that those calamities were 
sent by any other than the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth.<br><br>116That is, 
"I am not a bewitched man but you are indeed a doomed person. As you have been 
persistent in your disbelief even after seeing such obvious Divine Signs, you 
are surety doomed to destruction."<br><br>117This part of the story of Pharaoh 
has been related here because it applied exactly to the mushriks of Makkah who 
were doing their worst to uproot the Holy Prophet and the Believers from the 
land of Arabia. This story, so to say, tells them, "Pharaoh resolved to uproot 
Moses and the Israelites but was himself completely annihilated along with his 
followers and Moses and his followers settled down in the land. Likewise, if you 
persist on the same way, you will surely meet with the same end."<br><br>118That 
is, "It is not your responsibility to cause, in a supernatural manner, springs 
to gush forth or gardens to grow or pieces of the sky to fall down in order to 
convince those people who do not fudge the Qur'an by its teachings nor decide 
between the Truth and falsehood on merit. As the Qur'an has been sent down with 
truth, you should present it before the people and tell them plainly that the 
one, who believes, does so for his own good and the one who rejects it, does it 
at his own peril."<br><br>119This is an answer to this objection: "Why has not 
Allah sent down His Message as a whole? Why is He sending it piecemeal? Has 
Allah any need to think deliberately what to send down?" As the answer to this 
objection has been given in XVI: 101-102 and in the Explanatory Notes 104-106 
added to them, there is no need to repeat the same here.<br><br>120This refers 
to those people of the Book who were well-versed in the Scriptures and could 
judge them from their themes and wording.<br><br>121That is, "When they listen 
to the Qur'an, they at once recognize that its bearer is the promised Prophet 
mentioned in the Books of the former Prophets."<br><br>122This attitude of the 
righteous people of the Book has been mentioned at several places in the Qur'an, 
e.g., III: 113-114, 199, V: 83-84.<br><br>123This is the answer to another 
objection of the disbelievers. They said, "We have heard the name Allah for the 
Creator but where from have you brought the name Rahman?" This was because the 
name "Rahman " was not used for Allah and they did not like it.<br><br>124This 
instruction was given at Makkah. Ibn 'Abbas relates that when the Holy Prophet 
or his Companions offered their Prayers, they recited the Qur'an jn a loud 
voice. At this the disbelievers would raise a hue and cry and often called them 
names. Therefore, they wen enjoined that they should neither say their Prayers 
in such a loud voice as might incite the disbelievers nor should they say it in 
such a low voice that their own Companions might not hear it. This instruction 
was discontinued under the changed conditions at Al-Madinah. However, if the 
Muslims they have to face the same conditions, at any place or at any time, they 
should observe the same instruction.<br><br>125A subtle sarcasm is implied in 
the sentence. The mushriks believed that Allah had appointed assistants and 
deputies for the administration of His Kingdom. Obviously this meant that Allah 
was helpless and powerless to carry out the administration of His Kingdom: 
therefore, He needed supporters to help Him in the work of His Godhead. This 
sentence negates their false creeds, saying, “He does not stand in need of any 
gods and saints in order to delegate to them the different departments of His 
Godhead or make them governors in different parts of His Kingdom.”<br></p>
