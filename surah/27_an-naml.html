Moses said to his family: "I perceive a fire; soon will I bring you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning brand to light our fuel, that ye may warm yourselves.</li><li class="collection-item"> But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard: "Blessed are those in the fire and those around: and glory to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</li><li class="collection-item"> "O Moses! verily, I am Allah, the exalted in might, the wise!....</li><li class="collection-item"> "Now do thou throw thy rod!" But when he saw it moving (of its own accord)as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not his steps: "O Moses!" (it was said), "Fear not: truly, in My presence, those called as messengers have no fear,-</li><li class="collection-item"> "But if any have done wrong and have thereafter substituted good to take the place of evil, truly, I am Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> "Now put thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain (or harm): (these are) among the nine Signs (thou wilt take) to Pharaoh and his people: for they are a people rebellious in transgression."</li><li class="collection-item"> But when Our Signs came to them, that should have opened their eyes, they said: "This is sorcery manifest!"</li><li class="collection-item"> And they rejected those Signs in iniquity and arrogance, though their souls were convinced thereof: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly!</li><li class="collection-item"> We gave (in the past) knowledge to David and Solomon: And they both said: "Praise be to Allah, Who has favoured us above many of his servants who believe!"</li><li class="collection-item"> And Solomon was David´s heir. He said: "O ye people! We have been taught the speech of birds, and on us has been bestowed (a little) of all things: this is indeed Grace manifest (from Allah.)"</li><li class="collection-item"> And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts,- of Jinns and men and birds, and they were all kept in order and ranks.</li><li class="collection-item"> At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said: "O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it."</li><li class="collection-item"> So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: "O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants."</li><li class="collection-item"> And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: "Why is it I see not the Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?</li><li class="collection-item"> "I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty, or execute him, unless he bring me a clear reason (for absence)."</li><li class="collection-item"> But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: "I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba with tidings true.</li><li class="collection-item"> "I found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite; and she has a magnificent throne.</li><li class="collection-item"> "I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides Allah: Satan has made their deeds seem pleasing in their eyes, and has kept them away from the Path,- so they receive no guidance,-</li><li class="collection-item"> "(Kept them away from the Path), that they should not worship Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what ye hide and what ye reveal.</li><li class="collection-item"> "Allah!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme!"</li><li class="collection-item"> (Solomon) said: "Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied!</li><li class="collection-item"> "Go thou, with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them: then draw back from them, and (wait to) see what answer they return"...</li><li class="collection-item"> (The queen) said: "Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy of respect.</li><li class="collection-item"> "It is from Solomon, and is (as follows): ´In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful:</li><li class="collection-item"> "´Be ye not arrogant against me, but come to me in submission (to the true Religion).´"</li><li class="collection-item"> She said: "Ye chiefs! advise me in (this) my affair: no affair have I decided except in your presence."</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "We are endued with strength, and given to vehement war: but the command is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command."</li><li class="collection-item"> She said: "Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make the noblest of its people its meanest thus do they behave.</li><li class="collection-item"> "But I am going to send him a present, and (wait) to see with what (answer) return (my) ambassadors."</li><li class="collection-item"> Now when (the embassy) came to Solomon, he said: "Will ye give me abundance in wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift!</li><li class="collection-item"> "Go back to them, and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they will never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace, and they will feel humbled (indeed)."</li><li class="collection-item"> He said (to his own men): "Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Said an ´Ifrit, of the Jinns: "I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose, and may be trusted."</li><li class="collection-item"> Said one who had knowledge of the Book: "I will bring it to thee within the twinkling of an eye!" Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before him, he said: "This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free of all Needs, Supreme in Honour !"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "Transform her throne out of all recognition by her: let us see whether she is guided (to the truth) or is one of those who receive no guidance."</li><li class="collection-item"> So when she arrived, she was asked, "Is this thy throne?" She said, "It was just like this; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this, and we have submitted to Allah (in Islam)."</li><li class="collection-item"> And he diverted her from the worship of others besides Allah: for she was (sprung) of a people that had no faith.</li><li class="collection-item"> She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it, she thought it was a lake of water, and she (tucked up her skirts), uncovering her legs. He said: "This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass." She said: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do (now) submit (in Islam), with Solomon, to the Lord of the Worlds."</li><li class="collection-item"> We sent (aforetime), to the Thamud, their brother Salih, saying, "Serve Allah": But behold, they became two factions quarrelling with each other.</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to the good? If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive mercy.</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee". He said: "Your ill omen is with Allah; yea, ye are a people under trial."</li><li class="collection-item"> There were in the city nine men of a family, who made mischief in the land, and would not reform.</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "Swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his people, and that we shall then say to his heir (when he seeks vengeance): ´We were not present at the slaughter of his people, and we are positively telling the truth.´"</li><li class="collection-item"> They plotted and planned, but We too planned, even while they perceived it not.</li><li class="collection-item"> Then see what was the end of their plot!- this, that We destroyed them and their people, all (of them).</li><li class="collection-item"> Now such were their houses, - in utter ruin, - because they practised wrong-doing. Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We saved those who believed and practised righteousness.</li><li class="collection-item"> (We also sent) Lut (as a messenger): behold, He said to his people, "Do ye do what is shameful though ye see (its iniquity)?</li><li class="collection-item"> Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women?

<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>The Surah takes its name from the phrase wad-in-naml 
which occurs in verse 18, implying that it is a Surah in which the story of An-Naml 
(the Ant) has been related.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>
The subject matter and the style bear full resemblance with the Surahs of the 
middle Makkan period and this is supported by traditions as well. According to 
Ibn Abbas and Jabir bin Zaid, "First the Surah Ash-Shu`araa' was sent down, then 
the Surah An Naml and then Al-Qasas."<br><br><strong>Theme and Topics</strong><br>
<br>The Surah consists of two discourses, the first from the beginning of the 
Surah to the end of verse 58, and the second from verse 59 to the end of the 
Surah.<br><br>The theme of the first discourse is that only those people can 
benefit from the guidance of the Quran and become worthy of the good promises 
made in it, who accept the realities which this Book presents as the basic 
realities of the universe, and then follow up their belief with obedience and 
submission in their practical lives as well. But the greatest hindrance for man 
to follow this way is the denial of the Hereafter. For it makes him 
irresponsible, selfish and given to worldly life, which in turn makes it 
impossible for him to submit himself before God and to accept the moral 
restrictions on his lusts and desires. After this introduction three types of 
character have been presented.<br><br>The first type is characterized by Pharaoh 
and the chiefs of Thamud and the rebels of the people of Lot, who were all 
heedless of the accountability of the Hereafter and had consequently become the 
slaves of the world. These people did not believe even after seeing the 
miracles. Rather they turned against those who invited them to goodness and 
piety. They persisted in their evil ways which are held in abhorrence by every 
sensible person. They did not heed the admonition even until a moment before 
they were overtaken by the scourge of Allah.<br><br>The second type of character 
is of the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon him), who had been blessed by God with 
wealth and kingdom and grandeur to an extent undreamed of by the chiefs of the 
disbelievers of Makkah. But, since he regarded himself as answerable before God 
and had the feeling that whatever he had was only due to Allah's bounty, he had 
adopted the attitude of obedience before Him and there was no tinge of vanity in 
his character.<br><br>The third type is of the queen of Sheba, who ruled over a 
most wealthy and well known people in the history of Arabia. She possessed all 
those means of life, which could cause a person to become vain and conceited. 
Her wealth and possessions far exceeded the wealth and possessions of the 
Quraish. Then she professed shirk, which was not only an ancestral way of life 
with her, but she had to follow it in order to maintain her position as a ruler. 
Therefore, it was much more difficult for her to give up shirk and adopt the way 
of Tauhid than it could be for a common mushrik. But when the Truth became 
evident to her, nothing could stop her from accepting it. Her deviation was, in 
fact, due to her being born and brought up in a polytheistic environment and not 
because of her being a slave to her lusts and desires. Her conscience was not 
devoid of the sense of accountability before God.<br><br>In the second 
discourse, at the outset, attention has been drawn to some of the most glaring 
and visible realities of the universe, and the disbelievers of Makkah have been 
asked one question after the other to the effect : "Do these realities testify 
to the creed of shirk which you are following, or to the truth of Tauhid to 
which the Qur'an invites you?" After this the real malady of the disbelievers 
has been pointed out, saying, "The thing which has blinded them and made them 
insensitive to every glaring reality is their denial of the Hereafter. This same 
thing has rendered every matter and affair of life non-serious for them. For, 
when according to them, everything has to become dust ultimately, and the whole 
struggle of life is purposeless and without an object before it, the truth and 
falsehood are equal and alike. Therefore, the question whether one's system of 
life is based on the right or wrong foundations, becomes meaningless for him."<br>
<br>But the discourse, as outlined above, is not meant to dissuade the Prophet 
and the Muslims from calling the obdurate and heedless people to the way of 
Tauhid; it is, in fact, intended to arouse them from their slumber. That is why 
in vv. 67-93 certain things have been said repeatedly in order to produce in the 
people a sense of the Hereafter, to warn them of the consequences of being 
heedless of it, and to convince them of its coining, like an eye witness of 
something, who convinces the other person of it, who has not seen it.<br><br>In 
conclusion, the real invitation of the Quran that is, the invitation to serve 
One Allah alone, has been presented in a concise but forceful manner, and the 
people warned that accepting it would be to their own advantage and rejecting it 
to their own disadvantage. For if they deferred their faith until they saw those 
Signs of God after the appearance of which they would be left with no choice but 
to believe and submit, they should bear in mind the fact that that would be the 
time of judgment and believing then would be of no avail.</p>
<hr>
<p>1Kitab-i-mubin has three meanings: (1) This book presents its teachings and 
instructions and injunctions plainly; (2) it distinguishes between the Truth and 
falsehood clearly; and (3) its being a Divine Book is obvious: whoever studies 
it with open eyes will realize that it has not been composed and forged by the 
Holy Prophet himself. <br><br>2That is, the verses themselves are a "guidance" 
and "good news", because they give guidance and convey good news in a most 
excellent manner. <br><br>3That is, "These verses of the Qur'an give guidance 
and convey the good news of a good end only to those people who possess these 
two qualities: (1) They should affirm faith, that is, accept the invitation of 
the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and 
blessings), believe In one God as their only Deity and Lord, accept the Qur'an' 
as the Book of Allah, acknowledge the Holy Prophet as a true Prophet and their 
Leader, and also adopt the belief that after this life there is another life, in 
which man has to render his full account of deeds and be rewarded or punished 
accordingly. (2) They should not only profess faith verbally, but should also be 
inclined to follow and obey the Divine Commands practically, and the first 
indication of this inclination is that they should establish the Salat and pay 
the Zakat. The verses of the Qur'an will show the right way of life only to 
those people who fulfill these two conditions; they will explain to them the 
difference between the right and the wrong at every stage on the way, protect 
them against the wrong ways at every turn of the way, and bless them with the 
satisfaction that whatever be the consequences of following the Right Way in the 
world, in the Hereafter they will certainly attain the eternal and everlasting 
success and the good will of Allah only through it. For in order to derive full 
benefit from the teaching of a teacher, one has first to have faith in him, then 
accept to be his student, and then work according to his instructions. 
Similarly, a patient who wants to be benefited by a doctor has first to accept 
him as a physician, and then follow his instructions with regard to medical 
dosage, prevention, etc. Then only he can assure the patient of the desired 
results.<br><br>Some people have interpreted the words yu'tun-az-zakat in this 
verse to mean that they should adopt moral purity. But, wherever in the Qur'an 
the word ita-i-zakat has occurred along with the word iqamat-i-salat, it means 
payment of the Zakat, which is the second pillar of Islam after the Salat. 
Moreover, the Qur'an has used the word tazakka for adopting piety and purity and 
not ita' which is specifically used for the payment of the Zakat. In fact, what 
is meant to be impressed here is this: In order to benefit fully by the guidance 
of the Qur'an, it is imperative that one should adopt the attitude of submission 
and obedience in practical life as well after the affirmation of the Faith, and 
the establishment of the Salat and the payment of the Zakat is the first 
indication that one has actually adopted such an attitude. If there is no such 
indication, it will become obvious that one is rebellious: he might have 
acknowledged a ruler as such, but he is not inclined to carry out his commands.<br>
<br>4Although belief in the Hereafter is an article of the Faith, and a believer 
will also believe in it along with believing in Tauhid and the Prophethood, here 
it has been specially mentioned separately in order to bring out its unique 
importance. The object is to impress that for those people who do not believe in 
the Hereafter, it is impossible to follow, even tread, the way taught by the 
Qur'an. For the people of this way of thinking naturally determine their 
criterion of good and evil by the results that appear, in this world. For them 
it is not possible to accept any admonition or guidance which seeks to determine 
the good and evil by the criterion of the gain and loss in the Hereafter. Such 
people in the first instance do not at all heed the teachings of the Prophets, 
but if for some reason, they also get included among the believers, they find it 
difficult to take even the initial steps on the way of the Faith and Islam 
because of the lack of faith in the Hereafter. For as soon as they will 
encounter the first situation where the demands of the worldly gains and the 
losses of the Hereafter will pull them in opposite directions, they will freely 
allow themselves to be pulled towards the worldly gains without caring in the 
least for the losses of the Hereafter, even though they may be making all sons 
of claims to be the believers. <br><br>5That is. "This is God's Law of Nature 
and the natural logic of human psychology that when man thinks that the results 
of his life's struggle are confined to this world only when he does not believe 
in the existence of any court where his life's work has to be scrutinized and 
judged finally for good and evil, and when he does not believe in any life 
hereafter when he will be requited strictly in accordance with the real worth of 
his life's deeds, he will inevitably develop in himself a material outlook on 
life, and every kind of conflict between the Truth and falsehood, good and evil, 
morality and immorality, will appear utterly meaningless to him. Then, whatever 
earns him pleasure and enjoyment, material progress and prosperity, power and 
authority, will be the good for him, no matter it be any philosophy of life, any 
way of life and any system of morality. He will have no concern for truth and 
reality. His real ambition will be to win successes and earn adornments only of 
this worldly life, and their pursuit will lead him astray into every valley. 
Then, whatever he does with this object in view. will be a thing of beauty for 
him, and he will regard all those others as foolish, who are not absorbed like 
him in seeking the world, and doing anything and everything without any moral 
qualm and inhibition.<br><br>6Nothing definite has been said about the form, 
time and place of this "evil chastisement." For it is imposed in this world also 
on different persons and groups and' nations in countless different ways; a part 
of it is also experienced by the wicked when they are about to leave the world; 
man experiences it also in the intermediary state between death and 
Resurrection; and then after Resurrection it will become endless and 
everlasting.<br><br>7That is, the things being mentioned in the Qur'an are not 
imaginary nor are they based on the presumptions and opinions of a man, but they 
are being revealed by the One Who is All-Wise and All-Knowing, Who is perfect in 
Wisdom and Knowledge, Who has full knowledge of the affairs of His creation and 
of its past and present and future, and Whose Wisdom devises the best schemes 
for the reform and guidance of His servants. <br><br>8This happened at the foot 
of Mount Tur when the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) was traveling along with 
his family in search of a suitable place for settlement, after passing eight to 
ten years in Madyan (Midian). From Madyan, whose territory lay on both sides of 
the Gulf of `Aqabah, on the sea-shores of Arabia and the Sinai Peninsula, he 
reached the place called Mt. Sinai and Jabal Musa in the southern part of the 
Peninsula, which at the time of the revelation of the Qur'an was well known as 
Tur. (See also The Meaning of Qur'an, Vol. VIII Ash-Shu'araa', E.N. 115). The 
details of this story have already been given in Surah Ta Ha: 9-24 above and 
will, follow in Surah Al-Qasas: 29-36 below. <br><br>9The context shows that it 
was a cold wintry night and the Prophet Moses was passing through unfamiliar 
land. Therefore, he said to his family, "Let me go and find out what habitation 
it is where a fire is alight, and get some information about the traveling 
routes and the nearby habitations. I shall at least bring a few embers for you 
to light a fire and warm yourselves."<br><br>The place where the Prophet Moses 
had seen a burning bush is situated at about 5,000 ft. above sea level at the 
foot of Mt. Tur. Constantine, the first Christian Emperor of the Roman Empire, 
had a church built in about 365 A.D. right at the spot where this event had 
occurred. Two hundred years later Emperor Justinian had a monastery built which 
included the church built by Constantine as well. Both the monastery and the 
church stand even today and are under the control of the monks of the Greek 
Orthodox Church.<br><br>10According to AI-Qasas: 30, the voice was calling out 
from a tree. What one understands from this is this: A sort of a fire was alight 
on the ground on the edge of the valley, but neither was anything burning nor 
any smoke arising. In the midst of the fire there stood a lush green tree from 
which a voice started calling out this all of a sudden.<br><br>This is a strange 
thing which the Prophets of Allah have been experiencing. When the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (may Allah's peace be upon him) was first blessed with Prophethood, an 
Angel appeared before him in the solitude of the Gave of Hira' and started 
delivering Allah's Message. A similar thing happened with the Prophet Moses 
also. A journeying person has halted at a place, sees a fire at a distance, 
approaches it in order to get some information abort the route, or to pick a 
burning ember, and suddenly Allah, Lord of the Worlds, the Infinite, the 
Inconceivable Being, starts speaking to him. On such occasions, there exists 
externally as well as within the Prophets' own selves an extraordinary state 
which fills them with the assurance that it is not a jinn or a satan or an 
illusion of their own mind, nor are their senses being deceived, but it is the 
Lord of the universe, or His Angel, who is speaking to them. (For further 
explanation, see E.N. 10 of An-Najm). <br><br>11Here the use of the words Subhan 
Allah (glorified is Allah) is meant to warn the Prophet Moses to this effect: 
"You should never think that Allah, Lord of the universe, is sitting in the 
tree, or has entered into it, or that His absolute Light has concentrated itself 
into the limited sphere of your sight, or some tongue is functioning in some 
mouth to produce speech, but it is Allah, Who is Pure and Free from all such 
limitations, Who is Himself speaking to you." <br><br>12In Surahs Al-A`raf and 
Ash-Shu`araa', the snake has been called thu`ban (a large serpent) but here 
jaann, a small snake. The reason is that in physical size it was a serpent but 
in movement it was swift like a small snake. The same thing has been expressed 
by hayyatun tas `a (a running snake) in Ta Ha: 20. <br><br>13That is, "In My 
Presence there is no danger of any harm to the Messenger. When I call someone 
into My Presence to appoint him to the high office of Prophethood, I Myself 
become responsible for his safety. Therefore, the Messenger should remain 
fearless and confident in every kind of unusual situation: it will never harm or 
hurt him in any way. "<br><br>14This exception can be contiguous as well as 
remote. In the first case it will imply that there can be a genuine cause of 
fear if the Messenger has committed an offense; in the second case it will mean: 
"None should have any cause of fear in My Presence, unless, of course, someone 
has committed an offense."<br><br>15That is, "If even an offender repents and 
reforms himself and does good instead of evil, I will pardon him. ¦ This implied 
both a warning and a good news. The Prophet Moses had killed a Copt 
inadvertently and fled from Egypt. This was an offense to which a subtle 
reference was made. When this offense was committed un-intentionally by the 
Prophet Moses, he had immediately offered repentance to Allah, saying, "O my 
Lord! I have sinned against myself, so forgive me." So, "Allah forgave him" 
there and then. (Al-Qasas: 16). Here the good news of the same forgiveness has 
been given him, as if to say, "O Moses, there could be a genuine cause for you 
to feel afraid in My Presence, because you had committed an offense, but when 
you have changed the evil into good, I have nothing but forgiveness and mercy 
for you. I have not called you here at this time to punish you, but I am going 
to send you on a great mission with wonderful miracles."<br><br>16According to 
Surah Bani Isra'il:101, the Prophet Moses had been granted nine clearly visible 
Signs, which according to the details given in AI-A`raf were the following: (1) 
The staff's turning into a serpent, (2) the shining hand when it was drawn out 
of the armpit, (3) public triumph over the magicians, (4) occurrence of a 
widespread famine in the land as foretold by the Prophet Moses, (5) the storm, 
(6) the locusts, (7) the incidence of weevils in the grain stores and of lice 
among human beings and animals, (8) the frogs, and (9) the rain of blood. (Far 
explanation, see E.N. 43 of Az Zukhruf).<br><br>17As mentioned at other places 
in the Qur'an, whenever a plague befell Egypt as foretold by the Prophet Moses, 
Pharaoh would say, "O Moses, pray to your Lord to remove this plague; then we 
shall submit to what you say." But as soon as the plague was removed, Pharaoh 
would break his promise. (Al-A'raf: 134, Az-Zukhruf: 49-50). The Bible also has 
mentioned it (Exodus. 8 to 10), and otherwise also it could not be imagined that 
the occurrence of a famine throughout the country and the coming of a violent 
storm and the incidence of the locusts and the frogs and the weevils in such 
abundance could be due to any trick of magic. The miracles were so manifest that 
even a stupid person could not help realizing that the occurrence of the plagues 
on such a large scale and their removal at the Prophet's prayer could be only 
due to Allah, Lord of all Creation's power and authority. That is why the 
Prophet Moses had told Pharaoh plainly: "You know it full well that none but the 
Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these Signs." (Bani 
lsra'il:102). But the reason why Pharaoh and his chiefs rejected Moses knowingly 
was: "What! should we believe in these two men who are human beings like 
ourselves and whose people are our bondsmen'?" (Al Mu'minun: 47) <br><br>18That 
is, the knowledge of the Reality, the knowledge that whatever they have is not 
theirs but the gift of Allah and whatever rights they have been granted over 
those things should be used strictly according to Allah's will, for they will be 
held answerable before Allah, the real Owner, for the right and wrong use of 
those rights. This knowledge is the opposite of the ignorance in which Pharaoh 
was involved. The type of character built on the ignorance has been presented in 
the preceding verses. Now, in the following verses, the model of the character 
built on the knowledge is being presented. The sort of kingdom, wealth, power 
and grandeur were common on both the sides. The Pharaoh had been given these as 
well as the Prophets David and Solomon. But the distinction of the ignorance and 
the knowledge built and molded them into entirely different personalities. <br>
<br>19That is, "There were other believing, servants as well, who could be 
blessed with vicegerency. But it is only Allah's favor, not due to any special 
quality in ourselves, that He has chosen us to be rulers over this kingdom."<br>
<br>20Succession here does not mean inheritance of wealth and properties, but 
the succession to the Prophet David in the Prophethood and vicegerency. For the 
wealth and possessions, if at all transferred, could not be transferred to the 
Prophet Solomon only, because Prophet David had other children also. Therefore, 
this verse cannot be cited to refute the Hadith reported from the Holy Prophet, 
saying, "The inheritance left by us, the Prophets, is not divided as such. 
whatever we leave behind is charity." (Bukhari) And: "There is no heir to a 
Prophet. Whatever he leaves behind, is divided among the needy and the indigent 
of the Muslims." (Musnad Ahmad. Traditions from Abu Bakr, Ahadith No. 60 and 
78).<br><br>The Prophet Solomon was the youngest son of the Prophet David. His 
Hebrew name Solomon is a synonym of Salim (right-minded, affable). He succeeded 
the Prophet David in 965 B.C. and ruled his kingdom for forty years, till 
926B.C. For other details of his life and works, see E. N.'s 74-75 of Al Anbiyaa 
in The Meaning of the Qur'an, Vol. VII). Our commentators have greatly 
exaggerated' the vastness of his kingdom, and have held that he ruled over a 
large part of the world. The fact, however. is that his kingdom comprised only 
the present Palestine and Transjordan and a part of Syria. (See Map: Kingdom of 
the Prophets David and Solomon, The Meaning of the Qur'an, Vol. II, Bani Israel 
E. N. 7). <br><br>21There is no mention in the Bible that the Prophet Solomon 
had been taught speech of the birds and animals, though the Israelite traditions 
contain a reference to it. (Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. Xl.p. 598)<br><br>22That 
is, "Allah has bestowed on us all sorts of things." This, however, should not be 
understood literally; it only means the abundance of the wealth and the means of 
life granted by Allah. This was not said proudly by Prophet Solomon but only to 
express his gratitude to Allah for His grace and bounty and favors.<br><br>23The 
Bible does not either make any mention that there were jinns also in the Prophet 
Solomon's armies, and he took service from them; but the Talmud and the 
rabbinical traditions contain details of this. (Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. XI, p. 
440). Some of the present-day writers have strained every nerve to prove that 
the words jinn and fair do not refer to the jinns and birds but to men who 
performed different duties in the Prophet Solomon's army. They say that the Jinn 
haply the people of the mountain tribes whom Prophet Solomon had subdued and who 
performed teats of great strength and skill under him; and fair implies cavalry 
which could move much faster than the infantry. But these are indeed the worst 
examples of misinterpreting the Qur'an. The Qur'an here mentions three distinct 
kinds of the army consisting of the men, the jinns and the birds, and all the 
three gave been qualified by the prefix a1 (alif-lam) to denote a class. 
Therefore, al jinn and al-tair could not be included in al-ins (the men), but 
could be two separate and different classes from the men. Moreover, a person who 
has a little acquaintance with Arabic cannot imagine that in this language the 
mere word a/ Jinn could ever imply a group of the men, or al-tair troops mounted 
on horses, nor could any Arab understand these meanings from these words. 
Calling a man a jinn only figuratively because of some supernatural feat of his, 
or a woman a fairy because of her beauty, or a fast moving person a bird dces 
not mean that the words Jinn and fairy and bird will henceforth be taken to mean 
a powerful man and a beautiful woman and a fast moving person respectively. 
These are only the metaphoric and not the real meanings of these words. In a 
discourse, a word is used in its figurative instead of its real meaning, and the 
listeners also will take it in that meaning, only when there exists in the 
context a clear pointer to its being figurative. What, after all, is the pointer 
in the context here from which one may understand that the words jinn and tair 
have been used not in their real and lexical meaning but in their figurative 
meaning? Contrary to this, the work and the state of a member each of the two 
groups that have been mentioned in the following verses, fall entirely against 
the purport of this interpretation. If a person does not want to believe in 
something stated in the Qur'an, he should frankly say that he does not believe 
in it. But it would be moral cowardice and intellectual dishonesty if one should 
force the clear words of the Qur'an to give the meaning that he wants them to 
give, and tell the world that he believes in what the Qur'an says, whereas he 
does not, in fact, believe in it but believes in his own distorted meaning. <br>
<br>24This verse also has been greatly misconstrued by some commentators of the 
present day. They say that wad-in naml does not mean "valley of the ants", but 
it is the name of a valley that was in Syria, and namlah does not mean an ant 
but it is the name of a tribe. Thus, according to them, the verse means this: 
"When the Prophet Solomon reached the valley of the ants, a Namilite said, 'O 
people of the Naml tribe ......" But this also is an interpretation which is not 
supported by the words of the Qur'an. Even if we took wad-in-naml to be the name 
of a valley and supposed that it was inhabited by the tribe of Bani an-Naml, it 
would be against the Arabic idiom and usage to speak of a member of the tribe as 
namlah. Although there are many Arab tribes which have been named after the 
animals, e.g. Kalb (dog), Asad (lion), etc"., yet no Arab would ever say in 
respect of a member of the Kalb or the Asad tribe: "A dog said, or a lion said, 
etc. Therefore, it would be against the Arabic idiom to say in respect of a 
member of the Naml tribe: "A namlah (ant) said this." Then a member of the Naml 
tribe's warning the people of his tribe, saying, "O Namilites, get into your 
houses lest Solomon's hosts should trample you down without even knowing it," 
becomes meaningless, It has never happened that an army of men should have 
trampled down a group of men without knowing it. If the army has come with the 
intention of an attack, it would be useless for the other side to get into their 
houses, for in that case the invaders would follow them into their houses, and 
trample them more ruthlessly. And if the army is only on the routine march, it 
is just enough to clear off the way for it. Human beings may be harmed by the 
marching columns, but it can never happen that the soldiers on the march would 
trample down other men without knowing it. Therefore, if Bani an-Naml were a 
tribe of human beings, and one of its members were to warn his people, then in 
case of an attack, he would have said, "O Namilites, flee your houses and take 
refuge in the mountains lest Solomon's armies should destroy you. " And in case 
there was no danger of an attack, he would have said, "O Namilites, clear off 
the way lest one of you should be harmed by the marching columns of Solomon's 
armies."<br><br>This error in the interpretation is on account of the Arabic 
idiom and the subject-matter. As for the name of the valley and the tribe of 
Bani an-Naml inhabiting it, it is a mere hypothesis for which there exists no 
scientific proof. Those who hold that wad-in -naml was the name of a valley have 
themselves pointed out that it had been so named because of the abundance of 
ants in it. Qatadah and Muqatil say, "It is a valley in the land of Syria where 
ants are found in abundance. But in no book of history and geography and in no 
archaeological research it is mentioned that it was inhabited by a tribe called 
Bani an-Naml. Thus, it is merely a concoction that has been invented to support 
one's own interpretation.<br><br>This story is also found in the Israelite 
traditions but its latter portion falls against the Qur'an as well as against 
the regal dignity of the Prophet Solomon. According to it, when the Prophet 
Solomon was passing through a valley which abounded in ants, he heard an ant 
calling out to the other ants to say, "Get into your holes, otherwise you will 
be trampled down by Solomon's hosts." At this, Prophet Solomon displayed great 
vanity before the ant to which the ant rejoined, " What are you?-the product of 
a mere sperm-drop! " Hearing this the Prophet Solomon felt greatly ashamed. 
(Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. X1, p. 440). This shows how the Qur'an corrects the 
wrong traditions of the Israelites, and cleanses the filthy spots with which 
they had themselves branded the characters of their Prophets. It is these 
traditions about which the Western orientalists shamelessly claim that the 
Qur'an has plagiarized them for its narratives.<br><br>Rationally also it is not 
at all inconceivable that an ant should warn members of its' own species of an 
impending danger and tell them to get into their holes. As for the question as 
to how the Prophet Solomon heard it, the answer is: It is not all difficult to 
understand the crude speech of an ant for a person whose senses can comprehend 
and receive a subtle message like the Word of Revelation <br><br>25"Restrain 
me...thanks to Thee" means this: "O my Lord! the wonderful powers and abilities 
that You have given me are such that if I become even a little forgetful and 
heedless, I might transgress the bounds of service and be puffed up with pride 
and go astray. Therefore, O my Lord, restrain me so that I may remain grateful 
to You for all Your blessings instead of being ungrateful."<br><br>26"Admit 
me..righteous servants" probably implies this: "I should be included among the 
righteous in the Hereafter and should enter Paradise along with them." For a 
person who does righteous acts will automatically be righteous, but one's entry 
into Paradise in the Hereafter cannot come about merely on the strength of one's 
good works, but it will depend on Allah's mercy. According to a Hadith, the Holy 
Prophet once said, "Merely the deeds of any one of you will not enable him to 
enter Paradise." It was asked, "In your case too, O Messenger of Allah?" He 
replied, "Yes, I also shall not enter Paradise only on the strength of my deeds, 
unless Allah Almighty covers me with His mercy."<br><br>This prayer of the 
Prophet Solomon on this occasion becomes irrelevant if an Naml is taken to mean 
a vibe of human beings and namlah a member of that tribe. After all, there could 
be nothing extraordinary in the warning given by a member of a human tribe to 
the people of his vibe about the approaching troops of a powerful king that it 
should have induced the king to make such a prayer to Allah. However, a person's 
having such a wonderful power of comprehension that he may hear the speech of an 
ant from a distance and also understand it, is certainly something 
extraordinary, which can involve a person in self-conceit and vanity. In such a 
case only the prayer of the Prophet Solomon can be relevant."<br><br>27That is, 
the birds whose troops, as mentioned above, were included in the armies of 
Prophet Solomon like the troops of the men and jinns. It is just possible that 
the Prophet Solomon had employed them for communicating messages, hunting and 
performing other such services. <br><br>28Some people of the modern time say 
that the hud-hud (hoopoe) does not mean the bird commonly known by this name, 
but is the name of a man who was an officer in the army of Solomon. This claim 
is not based on any historical research in which they might have found a person 
named hud-hud included in the list of the officers of the government of the 
Prophet Solomon, but they base their claim on the argument that the custom of 
naming human beings after animals is prevalent in Arabic as in other languages 
and was also found in Hebrew. Moreover, the, work that has been ascribed to the 
hud-hud in the following verses and its conversation with the Prophet Solomon, 
can, according to them, be only performed by a human being. But if one keeps in 
view the context in which this thing occurs in the Qur'an, it becomes evident 
that this is no commentary of the Qur'an but its distortion. After all, why 
should the Qur'an put the intellect and intelligence of man to the test by using 
enigmatic language '? Why should it not clearly say that a soldier of the 
Prophet Solomon's cavalry, or platoon, or communication department, was missing, 
whom he ordered to be searched out, and who came and gave this news and whom he 
dispatched on such and such a mission? Instead, it uses such language that the 
reader, from the beginning to the end, is compelled to regard it as a bird. Let 
us, in this connection, consider the tarts in their sequence as presented in the 
Qur'an.<br><br>First of all, the Prophet Solomon expresses his gratitude to 
Allah for His this bounty: "We have been taught the speech of the birds." In 
this sentence, firstly, the word Lair has been used absolutely which every Arab 
and scholar of Arabic will take in the meaning of a bird, because there is 
nothing in the context that points to its being figurative; secondly, if tair 
implied a group of men and not a bird, the ward language or tongue would have 
been used concerning it and not speech. 'Then, a person's knowing the tongue of 
another people is not so extraordinary a thing that it should be specially 
mentioned. Today there are among us thousands of men and women, who can speak 
and understand many foreign languages. This is in no way an unusual achievement 
which may be mentioned as an extraordinary gift of God.<br><br>Then the Qur'an 
says, "For Solomon were gathered hosts of jinns and then and birds." In this 
sentence, firstly, the words Jinn and ins (men) and tair have been used as names 
for three well-known and distinct species denoted by these words in Arabic. Then 
they have been used absolutely and there is nothing in the context that may 
point to any of them being used metaphorically, or as a simile. hecause of which 
one may take them in another meaning than their well- known lexical meaning. 
Then the word ins has occurred between the words jinn and Lair which does not 
allow taking it in the meaning that the Jinn and the tair were, in tact, two 
groups included in the species of ins (men). Had this been meant the words would 
have been: ul jinn wat-tair min-al-ins and not min-al- Jinn wal-ins Wat-tair.<br>
<br>A little further un the e Qur'an says that the Prophet Solomon said this 
when-during his review of the birds hr found the hud-hud missing. If the fair 
were human beings and hud-hud also was the name of a man, a word or two should 
Dave been there to indicate this so that cite poor reader should not have taken 
the word for a bird. When the group being mentioned is clearly of the birds and 
a number of it is called hud-hud. how can it be expected that the reader will of 
his own accord understand them to be human beings'?<br><br>Then the Prophet 
Solomon says, "I will punish him severely, or even slaughter him, unless he 
presents before me a reasonable excuse." A man is killed, or hanged, or 
sentenced to death, but never slaughtered. Some hard-hearted person may even 
slaughter another person out of vengeance, but it cannot be expected of a 
Prophet that he would sentence a soldier of his army to be slaughtered only for 
the offense of desertion, and Allah would mention this heinous act of the 
Prophet without a word of disapproval.<br><br>A little further on we shall again 
see that the Prophet Solomon sends the same hud-hud with a letter to the queen 
of Sheba and tells him "to cast it before her". Obviously, such an instruction 
can be given to a bird but not at all to a man when he is sent as an envoy or 
messenger. Only a foolish person will believe that a king would send his envoy 
with a letter to the queen of another country and tell him to cast or throw it 
before her. Should we suppose that the Prophet Solomon was not aware of the 
preliminary social etiquette which even common people like us also observe when 
we send our servant to a neighbor? Will a gentleman tell his servant to carry 
his letter to the other gentleman and throw it before him?<br><br>All these 
things show that the word hud-hud here has been used in its lexical meaning, 
showing that he was not a man but a bird. Now, if a person is not prepared to 
believe that a hud-hud can speak those things that have been ascribed to it in 
the Qur'an, he should frankly say that he does not believe in this narrative: of 
the Qur'an. It is sheer hypocrisy to misconstrue plain and clear words of the 
Qur'an according to one's own whims only in order to cover up one's lack of 
faith in it. <br><br>29Saba' were a well-known commercial people of southern 
Arabia, whose capital city of Ma'rib lay about 55 miles to the north-east of 
San`a', the present capital of Yaman. They rose to power after the decline of 
the Minaean Kingdom in about 1100 B.C. and flourished for a thousand years in 
Arabia. Then in 115 B.C. they were replaced by the Himyarites, the other 
well-known people of southern Arabia, who ruled Yaman and Hadramaut in Arabia 
and Habash in Africa. The Sabaeans controlled the whole trade that passed 
between eastern Africa, India, the Far East and Arabia itself, on the one hand, 
and Egypt, Syria, Greece and Rome on the other. That is why they were famous for 
their wealth in the ancient times; so much so that according to the Greek 
historians they were the richest people of the world. Besides trade and 
commerce, another great reason for their prosperity was that they had built dams 
here and there in their country to store rainwater for irrigation purposes, 
which had turned their whole land into a veritable garden. The Greek; historians 
have made mention of the unusual greenery of their country; and the Qur'an also 
refers to it in Surah Saba': 15.The statement of the hud-hud, `I have obtained 
knowledge of things of which you have no knowledge", does not imply that the 
Prophet Solomon was wholly unaware of Saba'. Obviously, the ruler of Syria and 
Palestine whose kingdom extended to the northern shores of the Red Sea (Gulf of 
`Aqabah), could not be unaware of a people who ruled the southern shores (Yaman) 
of the same Red Sea, and who also controlled an important pan of the 
international trade. Moreover, according to Psalms, Solomon's father, Prophet 
David, knew Saba' We lied the following words of his prayer in Psalms<br><br>
"Give the king thy judgment, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son 
(i.e. Solomon)... The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: 
the kings of Sheba and Seba (i.e. of Yaman's and Habash's branches) shall offer 
gifts." (72: 1-2, 10-11).<br><br>Therefore, what the hud-hud means to say is 
this: "The knowledge of the things 1 have seen with my eyes in the central city 
of the Sabaeans. has not yet reached you." <br><br>30This shows that the people 
of Saba' at that lime followed the religion of sun-worship, which is also 
supported by the ancient traditions of Arabia. Ibn ishaq has cited the 
genealogists' saying to the effect that Saba' have in fact descended from an 
ancestor whose name was `Abd Shams (slave of the sun, or sun-worshiper) and 
title Saba'. This is supported by the Israelite traditions as well. According to 
these when the hud-hud arrived with the Prophet Solomon's letter, the queen of 
Sheba was going for the worship of the sun-god, and it threw the letter on the 
way before the queen. <br><br>31The style shows that the sentences from here to 
the end of the paragraph are not a part of the hud-hud's speech but its speech 
ended with: "they prostrate themselves before the sun", and these words are an 
addition by Allah to its speech. His opinion is supported by the sentence: "He 
knows all that you conceal and reveal." These words give the impression that the 
speaker and the addressees here are not he hud-hud and the Prophet Solomon and 
his courtiers respectively, but the speaker is Allah and the addressees the 
mushriks of Makkah, for whose admonition this story has been related. From among 
the commentators, Allamah Alusi;, the author of Ruh-al-Ma ani, also has 
preferred the same opinion. <br><br>32That is, Satan has made them believe that 
earning the worldly wealth and making, their lives more and more grand and 
pompous is the only real and fit use of their mental and intellectual and 
physical powers. Apart from these, they need not think seriously on anything 
else: they need not bother themselves to see whether there was any factual 
reality behind the apparent life of the world or not, and whether the basis of 
their religion, morality, culture and system of life accorded with that Reality 
or went utterly against it. Satan satisfied them that when they were making 
adequate progress in respect of wealth and power and worldly grandeur, they had 
no need to see whether their beliefs and philosophies and theories were correct 
or not, for the only proof of their being correct was that they were earning 
wealth and enjoying life to their hearts content. <br><br>33That is, He is 
bringing continuously into existence those things which before their ' birth 
were hidden here and there: He is bringing out continuously countless kinds of 
vegetation and minerals from the bowels of the earth: He is manifesting from 
upper space such things as could not even be conceived by the human mind before 
their manifestation. <br><br>34That is, His knowledge embraces everything; the 
open and hidden are alike for Him; He is aware of everything. By citing these 
two attributes of Allah the object is to impress that if they had not been 
deluded by Satan, they could have seen the right way clearly: they could have 
perceived that the hot burning sphere of the sun which has no sense of its own 
existence, did not deserve to be worshiped but worship was due to Him alone Who 
is the All-Knowing and the All-Wise Being, and Whose power is bringing into 
existence new and ever stew phenomena every moment. <br><br>35This is one of 
those verses of the Qur'an, whose recital makes it obligatory for one to perform 
a Sajdah (prostration), and there is a consensus on this of the Muslim jurists. 
The object of performing a Sajdah here is that a believer should set himself 
apart from the sun-worshipers and should declare by his action that he does not 
regard the sun but Allah Almighty alone as his Deity and Lord.<br><br>36Here 
ends the role of the hud-hud (hoopoe). The rationalists deny its being a bird 
for the reason that a bird could not possibly be endowed with such powers of 
observation, discrimination and expression that it should pass over a country 
and should come to know that it is the land of Saba`, it has such and such a 
system of government, it is ruled by a certain woman, its religion is sun 
worship, that it should have worshiped One God instead of having gone astray, 
and then on its return to the Prophet Solomon it should so clearly make a report 
of all its observations before him. Due to these very reasons the open atheists 
object that the Qur'an is a book of fables and legends; then those who try to 
interpret the Qur'an rationally misconstrue its clear words in order to prove 
that the hud-hud was not at all a bird but he was a man. But the question is: 
What scientific information have these gentlemen got by which they could tell 
with absolute certainty what powers and abilities the different species of 
animals and their different individuals have got? The information that they 
possess only consists of the results interred froth the grossly insufficient 
observation made cursorily by them of the life and behavior of the animals. In 
fact, man has not so far been able to know through any certain means what 
different animals know and what they see and hear. and what they feel and think 
and understand, and how the mind of each one of them works. Yet, whatever little 
observation has been made of the life of the different species of animals, it 
has revealed some of their wonderful abilities. Now, when Allah, Who is the 
Creator of these animals, tells us that He had taught the speech of the birds to 
one of His Prophets and blessed him with the ability to speak to them, and the 
Prophet's taming and training had so enabled a hud-hud that it could make 
certain observations in the foreign lands and could report theta to the Prophet, 
we should, in fact, be prepared to revise our little knowledge about the animals 
in the light of Allah's statement. But, instead, we commit the folly of taking 
our this insufficient knowledge as the criterion and belie this statement of 
Allah or distort it out of its true meaning.<br><br>37That is, "The letter is 
important for several reasons: (1) It has reached me in an unusual way. Instead 
of an envoy it has been brought and dropped at me by a bird. (2) It is from 
Solomon, the great ruler of Palestine and Syria. (3) It has been begun with the 
name of Allah, the Compassionate, and Merciful, which is an unusual way of 
correspondence and is not followed by any kingdom in the world. (4) Then, it is 
also unusual that a letter should be written only in the name of Allah, the 
Exalted, spare from all other gods and goddesses. (5) The most important thing 
in it is that it quite clearly and plainly invites us to give up rebellion and 
adopt obedience and present ourselves before Solomon in submission (or as 
Muslims)."<br><br>"Present yourselves as Muslim" can have two meanings: (I) 
"Present yourselves in submission"; and (2) "present yourselves as Muslims 
(after embracing Islam)." The first meaning is in accordance with the Prophet 
Solomon's position as a ruler, and the second with his position as a Prophet. 
Probably this comprehensive word was used in order to convey both the meanings 
through the letter. The same sort of invitation has always been extended by 
Islam to independent nations and governments that they should either accept 
Islam and become equal partners in the Islamic system of life, or surrender 
political independence and submit to the system of Islam and pay Jizyah"<br><br>
38The words used in the Text are: hatta tash-hu-dun (unless you are present, or 
unless you bear witness). That is: "I regard your presence necessary when I take 
a decision in important matters, and also that whatever decision I take you 
should be there to testify that it is right and correct." This shows that though 
the system of government among Saba' was kingship, it was not tyrannical; but 
the ruler of the time decided matters in consultation with the important people 
in the government. <br><br>39In this one sentence a thorough criticism has been 
made of imperialism. The kings' invasion of the other countries and the 
victorious nations' violence against the oppressed nations has never been for 
the sake of reform and goodwill. 'fire object has been to control and exploit 
the means and resources of sustenance granted to the other nation by God, and 
make it so helpless that it should never be able to rise in resistance and 
demand its share. For this purpose they block up all it, means of prosperity, 
power and honor, crush down all self respecting elements, instill in its members 
attitudes of slavery, flattery, treachery and spying against one another, 
imitation of the conqueror and respect for his civilization, contempt of their 
own civilization and other such mean qualities of character. Thus, gradually 
they bring them down to such a low level of character where they may not 
hesitate even to sell off any of their most sacred objects of heritage and be 
ready to perform any wretched service on payment.<br><br>40This sentence has two 
meanings and both are equally probable: (1) It may be a part of the queen of 
Sheba's speech, which she might have added in order to emphasize her foregoing 
words; and (2) it may be Allah's words which have been added as a parenthesis in 
support of the queen's speech.<br><br>41This sentence is not meant to express 
pride and vanity. What it means to say is this: "I have no desire for your 
wealth; I only desire that you should believe, or at least submit to a righteous 
system. if you agree to neither of these alternatives, it is not possible for me 
to accept the bribes of wealth and leave you tree in the , matter of a 
polytheistic and wicked system of life. What my Lord has given me is enough for 
me to cherish any desire for your wealth. <br><br>42There is a subtle gap 
between this and the previous sentence, which one can easily till up by a 
careful study of the discourse. It means this: "O Messengers, take ties gift 
back to the people who nave sent you. They will either have to yield to our 
first proposal, i. e. they should come before us as Muslims, or we shall bring 
forces against them."<br><br>43The details of the story that have been omitted 
are to the effect: The envoys returned to the queen with the gift and made a 
report of what they had seen and heard; the queen decided on the basis of what 
she heard about the Prophet Solomon to make a visit to Jerusalem to see him 
personally; she left Saba' for Palestine accompanied by her royal entourage and 
Sent a message to Solomon's court that she was herself coming to personally hear 
the invitation from the king himself and to have a direct talk with him. Here, 
the story is resumed from the time when the queen had reached near Jerusalem and 
was going to appear before Solomon in a day or two.<br><br>44That is, the same 
throne about which the hoopoe (hud- hud) had reported, "She has a splendid 
throne." Some commentators have given a strange interpretation here. They say 
that the Prophet Solomon wanted to have the throne before him before the queen's 
arrival because he wanted to take possession of it. For he feared that if the 
queen became a Muslim. it would be unlawful to take possession of her property 
without her approval: therefore, he made haste to have the queen's throne with 
him even before her arrival in Jerusalem because at chat time it was lawful to 
take it into his possession. May Allah pardon us! This is a strange concept 
about the intention of a Prophet. Why should one not understand the verse in the 
light that Prophet Solomon wanted to show a miracle also to the queen and her 
courtiers besides preaching his message so that she might know what 
extraordinary powers Allah, Lord of the worlds, had granted His Prophet so that 
she might be convinced that Solomon was surely a Prophet of Allah`? Some modern 
commentators have put an even more strange meaning on this verse. They translate 
the verse thus: "Which of you can bring me a throne for the queen:'" whereas the 
Qur'an has used the word bi- 'arshi-ha which means "her throne', and not bi-'arshil,-laha, 
"a throne for her". They mistranslate the verse in order to get rid of what the 
Qur'an has stated that the Prophet Solomon wanted the queen's own throne to be 
brought froth Yaman to Jerusalem and that too before the queen's arrival. <br>
<br>45From this it becomes obvious whether the jinns under the Prophet Solomon 
were, according to the interpretation of some rationalist commentators of the 
modern times, from among mankind or from among the hidden creation commonly 
known as jinns. Obviously, the sitting of the Prophet Solomon's court would at 
the most be of three to four hours, and the distance of Ma'rib, capital of 
Saba', from Jerusalem was even as the crow dies, not less than 1500 miles. To 
fetch a splendid throne of a queen from such a distant place in such a short 
time could not be possible for a man, even if he be a very strong and robust 
person. This task cannot be performed even by a jet plane of today. The throne 
was not lying in a jungle from where it had just to be fetched. It lay in a 
queen's palace, which must have been well-guarded, and in the absence of the 
queen it must have been kept in a secure place If a man had gone to fetch it, he 
should have been accompanied by a commando force so that he could overwhelm the 
guards and snatch away the throne. How could all this be accomplished before the 
rising of the court? This thing can be conceived only in connection with a real 
Jinn !<br><br>46That is, "You can trust me in that I will not carry it away, nor 
steal any valuable thing from it.”<br><br>47Nothing is known with certainty as 
to who this person was, what special knowledge he had and what Book is referred 
to here, whose knowledge he had. No explanation of these things has been given 
either in the Qur'an or in any authentic Hadith. Some of the commentators say 
that it was an angel; others say that it was a man. Then they differ as to the 
identity of the man. Someone mentions the name of Asaf bin Barchiah, who, 
according to the rabbinical traditions, was the Prince of Men. Someone says that 
he was Khidr; someone mentions some other name; and Imam Razi insists that it 
was the Prophet Solomon himself. But none of these has any reliable source for 
his information, and Imam Razi's opinion does not even fit in with the Qur'anic 
context. Likewise, about the Book also the commentators differ. Someone says 
that it refers to Lauh-i-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet) and some other takes it 
for the Book of Law. But all this is mere guess-work. Similar guesses have been 
made about the knowledge the man had from the Book. We only know and believe 
what has been said in the Qur'an, or what becomes evident from its words In any 
case the person was not from among the jinns, and possibly he was a man. He 
possessed some extraordinary knowledge, which had been derived from some Divine 
Book (al-Kitab) . The jinn had claimed to fetch the throne within a few hours by 
means of his physical strength; this man fetched it in a moment by the power of 
his knowledge.<br><br>48The words of the Qur'an are very clear in this regard. 
This person's claim did not remain a claim like the jinn's, but, in tact, as 
soon as he made the claim the throne was seen placed before the Prophet Solomon 
the next moment. just consider these words:<br><br>"The person said, `I will 
bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye.' As soon as Solomon saw the throne 
placed before him...."<br><br>Anyone who reads these words, regardless of the 
extraordinary nature of the event, will surely understand that no sooner did the 
person utter these words than the event as claimed by him took place forthwith. 
There is, therefore, no need to make far-fetched interpretations of this plain 
matter. Then, on seeing the throne, the Prophet Solomon's exclaiming, "This is 
by the Grace of my Lord so that He may test me (to see) whether I am grateful or 
ungrateful!" can be relevant only if the event be extraordinary; otherwise if 
only a skillful craftsman of the king had hurriedly made or arranged a throne 
for the queen, it could not be so novel an event at which the Prophet Solomon 
should have spontaneously exclaimed: "This is by the Grace of my Lord!..." and 
feared that the prompt arrangement of a throne for the honorable guest might 
cause him to become ungrateful to Allah instead of being grateful. After all, 
there could be no question of a believing ruler's becoming involved in vanity 
and self-conceit on this small achievement, especially when he was not merely an 
ordinary believer but a Prophet of Allah<br><br>As for the question as to how a 
royal throne was fetched over a distance of 1,500 miles in the twinkling of an 
eye, it can be briefly answered thus: "The concepts of time and space, and 
matter and movement, that we have formed on the basis of our experiments and 
observations, are only applicable to us. These concepts are not correct in 
respect to God, nor is He bound by these. Not to speak of an ordinary throne, 
His power can make the sun; and even much larger stars, travel millions of 
millions of miles in the matter of moments. The God Who by His one Command 
brought this huge universe into being, had the power to have moved the throne of 
the queen of Sheba at a speed greater than the speed of light. In this very 
Qur'an it has been stated that Allah, by His powers, took his servant Muhammad 
(may Allah's peace be upon him) from Makkah to Jerusalem and also brought him 
back in the same night. <br><br>49That is, He does not stand in need of 
somebody's gratefulness. His Godhead is neither enhanced by an iota by 
somebody's gratefulness nor diminished by that amount by somebody's ingratitude 
or thanklessness. He is a Sovereign in His own right. His Sovereignty is not 
dependent on His creation's acknowledgment or rejection. The same thing has been 
expressed in the Qur'an through the Prophet Moses: "If you prove thankless, you 
and all the dwellers of the earth, (you should know that) Allah is 
All-Sufficient and worthy of all praise by Himself." (Ibrahim: 8). The same 
theme is contained in a Hadith Qudsi related in Muslims saying:<br><br>"Allah 
says: O My servants, if you all men and jinns, from the beginning to the end, 
together become like the heart of the most righteous person among you, it will 
not cause any increase in My Kingdom; and O My servants, if you all men and 
jinns, from the beginning to the end, together become like the heart of the most 
sinful person among you, it will not cause any decrease in My Kingdom. O My 
servants, it is your own deeds which I credit to your account, and then fully 
recompense you for them. So, whoever receives something good, let him be 
grateful to Allah, and whoever receives something else, let him curse his own 
self only".<br><br>50As to how the queen reached Jerusalem and how she was 
received, has been omitted. The story is resumed from the time when she had 
arrived at the palace to see Prophet Solomon.<br><br>51This is a meaningful 
sentence, which means: (1) "Whether she understands or not that it is her own 
throne which has been fetched in no time from her capital to distant place like 
Jerusalem;" and also (2) "whether she is guided aright after seeing this 
wonderful miracle, or persists in her error." This refutes the wrong idea of the 
people who say that the Prophet Solomon intended to take possession of the 
throne. Here he himself clearly says that he had done this in order to help the 
queen see Guidance.<br><br>52This also refutes the speculations of those people 
who depict the event in :t manner as though the Prophet Solomon wanted to have u 
throne made for the queen and for this purpose he invited tenders and a strong, 
robust artisan offered to make hint a throne in the matter of a few hours, but 
,n expert craftsman submitted that he could make and produce it in no time. This 
w hole guess-work is destroyed by the tact that Solomon himself ordered the 
throne to be fetched before him (v. 381), and when it had been fetched, ordered 
his servants to set it before the queen casually (v. 41), and then when she 
arrived, she was asked whether her throne was like that (v. 42), and she 
answered, "It is just the same." Obviously, there could he no room for the 
absurd interpretations in the face of such a clear statement of facts. If there 
is still any doubt left, it can be satisfied by the next sentence. <br><br>
53That is, "Even before we saw this miracle we had been convinced by what we had 
heard of Solomon (peace be upon him) that he was a Prophet of Allah, and not 
merely a ruler of a kingdom." After seeing the throne and saying, "It is just 
the same", what could be the relevance of adding this sentence if it is supposed 
that the Prophet Solomon had got a throne manufactured and set the same before 
her? Even if it is supposed that no effort was spared to have a throne 
manufactured closely resembling the queen's what special excellence it could 
have to make a sun- worshiping queen exclaim "We had already known this and we 
had become Muslims!"<br><br>54This sentence has been added by Allah to clarity 
the queen's position, saying that she was not obdurate and stubborn. She had 
been an unbeliever till then mainly because she canto of an unbelieving people. 
As she had become accustomed to bowing down before a false deity since her 
childhood, it had become a hindrance for her to the right way. As soon as she 
came in contact with the Prophet Solomon, she discerned the right way and the 
hindrance was removed Forthwith. <br><br>55This was the last thing that opened 
the queen's eyes. The first thing was Solomon's letter that had been begun with 
the name of the AII-Compassionate, the AII-Merciful Allah, a way different front 
the common custom prevalent among the kings. The second was his rejection of her 
gifts, which made the queen understand that he was a different kind of king. The 
third was the report made by the queen's envoys froth which she came to know 
about Solomon's pious life, his wisdom and his message of the Truth. This very 
dung had induced her to travel to Jerusalem herself to personally meet the 
Prophet Solomon, and to this she had referred when she said. "We had already 
known this and we had become Muslims." The fourth thing was the removal of her 
throne from Ma'rib to Jerusalem in no time, from which the queen realized that 
he had Allah's power at Itil hack. Now this was the last thing that removed 
every doubt front her mind regarding the unique and great personality of the 
Prophet Solomon. When she saw that in spite of possessing every means of comfort 
and ease and a grand palace for a dwelling, he was so free from every conceit, 
so God-fearing and righteous and so grateful to God that he bowed before Him far 
every small favor and his life so different from the life of those who were 
enamored of the world, she exclaimed the words that follow. <br><br>56This story 
of the Prophet Solomon and the queen of Sheba has been related in the Old and 
the New Testaments and the Israelite traditions in different ways, but the 
Qur'anic narration differs from all others. A resume of the story as given in 
the Old Testament is as follows:<br><br>"And when the queen of Sheba heard of 
the tame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, 
with a very great company . when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him 
of all that was in her heart. And Solomon told her all her questions ...... And 
when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he 
had built, and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the 
attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cup bearers also, and their 
apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord; there 
was no more spirit in her. And she said to the king, It was a true report which 
I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thine wisdom: Howbeit I believed 
nut their words, until I carte, and thine eves had seen it: and, behold, the one 
half of the greatness of they wisdom Was not told rte: for thou exceedest the 
(ante that 1 heard. Happy are thy men. and happy are these thy servants, which 
stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. Blessed be the Lord they 
God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne ..... And she gave the 
king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance and 
precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave 
king Solomon ..... And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, 
whatever she asked ..... So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and 
her servants." (2 Chronicles, 9: 1-12. A similar account is also found in I 
Kings, 10: 1-13).<br><br>In the New Testament. the following sentence only has 
been reported from a discourse of the Prophet Jesus about the queen of Sheba .<br>
<br>"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, 
and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear 
the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here." (Matthew, 
12: 42; Luke, 11: 31).<br><br>The story of the Prophet Solomon and the queen of 
Sheba as given in the rabbinical traditions resembles in most parts with the 
Qur'anic version. The hopoe's absence, then its .arrival and reporting about 
Sheba and its queen, the Prophet Solomon's sending her a letter through it, the 
hoopoe's dropping the letter in front of the queen right at the time when she 
was going for sun-worship, the queen's calling for her ministers' council, then 
her sending of valuable gifts to Solomon, her traveling to Jerusalem and meeting 
him personally, her arrival in the palace and thinking that Prophet Solomon was 
sitting in the midst of a pool of water, tucking up her skirt in order to enter 
it-all this has been mentioned in these traditions as in the Qur'an. But there 
is no mention whatsoever in these traditions of the Prophet Solomon's reply on 
receipt of the gift, having the queen's th rune fetched from Ma'rib, his bowing 
down before God in thankfulness for every favor of His, and the queen's 
embracing the Faith ultimately, at his hand, his belief in the oneness of God, 
etc. And worst of all, these wicked people have accused Prophet Solomon of 
having committed adultery, God forbid, with the queen of Sheba, giving rise to 
an illegitimate race, which gave birth to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, 
who destroyed Jerusalem. (Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. XI, p. 443). The fact of the 
matter is that n section of the Jewish learned men have been highly critical of 
the Prophet Solomon. They have accused him of heinous crimes like violating the 
Commandments of the Torah, of pride of government, pride of wisdom, of being a 
hen-pecked husband, and of luxurious living, polytheism and idol-worship. 
(Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. XI, pp. 439-441). It is due to this propaganda that 
the Bible presents him only as a king instead of a Prophet, a king who was lost 
in the love of polytheistic women against the Divine Commandments, whose heart 
was turned away from God, and was turned to other gods and goddesses. (I Kings, 
11: 1-11). As against this it can be seen what great favor has the Qur'an done 
to the Israelites by cleansing the personalities of their elders of the tilth 
thrown at them by themselves, and yet the Israelites, ungrateful as they are, 
look upon the Qur'an and him who brought it as their enemies.<br><br>57For 
comparison. see Al-A'raf: 73-79, Hud: 61-68, Ash-Shu'ara': 141159, AI-Qamar: 
23-32, Ash-Shams: 11-15. <br><br>58That is, as soon as the Prophet Salih 
embarked on his mission, his people were divined into two groups, the believers 
and the disbelievers, and a conflict started between them as stated elsewhere in 
the Qur'an:<br><br>"The chiefs of his tribe, who .were full of pride, said to 
those who had believed from among the oppressed people, 'Do you know it for 
certain that Salih is a Messenger from his Lord?' They replied, `Indeed, we 
believe in the message with which he has been sent.' But those who had arrogant 
assumption of superiority, said, `We deny that which you believe'." (Al-A'raf: 
75-76).<br><br>One should note that precisely the same situation arose in Makkah 
at the advent of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace be upon him). The 
nation was divided into two factions and a conflict started between them. 
Therefore, this story fully applied to the conditions in which these verses were 
revealed.<br><br>59That is, "Why do you hasten in asking for a torment instead 
of some good from Allah`?" The following saying of the chiefs of the Prophet 
Salih's people has been related at another place: "O Salih, bring that scourge 
with which you threaten us, if you really are one of the Messengers." 
(Al-A`raf:77). <br><br>60One meaning of what they said is: "Your movement has 
proved to be an evil omen for us. Since you and your companions have revolted 
against the ancestral religion, one or the other calamity is befalling us almost 
daily, because our deities have become angry with us. In this sense, this saying 
is similar to the sayings of most of those polytheistic nations who regarded 
their Prophets as ominous. In Surah Ya Sin, for instance, a nation has been 
mentioned, which said to its Prophet "We regard you as an evil omen for 
ourselves." (v. 18) The same thing was said by the Pharaoh's people about the 
Prophet Moses: "Whenever a good time came, they would say, `This is but our 
due', and when there was a bad time, they would ascribe their calamities to 
Moses and his companions." (Al A`raf 130) Almost similar things were said in 
Makkah about the Holy Prophet also.<br><br>The other meaning of their saying is 
this: "Your advent has stirred up divisions in our nation. Before this we were a 
united people, who followed one religion. Your ominous coming has turned brother 
against brother, and separated son from father. " This very accusation was being 
brought against the Holy Prophet by his opponents over and over again. Soon 
after he started his mission of inviting the people to the Faith, the delegation 
of the chiefs of the Quraish, who went to Abu Talib, had said, "Give up to us 
this nephew of yours: he has opposed your religion and your forefathers' 
religion and has sown discord among your people, and has held the whole nation 
as foolish." (Ibn Hisham, Vol. I. p. 285).<br><br>On the occasion of Hajj, when 
the disbelievers of Makkah feared that the visitors from outside might be 
influenced by the Holy Prophet, they held consultations and decided to approach 
the Arab tribes and tell them: "This man is a sorcerer, who by his sorcery 
separates son from his father, brother from his brother, wife from her husband, 
and man from his family." (Ibn Hisham, p. 289). <br><br>61That is, "The truth is 
not that which you understand it to be. The fact which you have not yet realized 
is that my advent has put you to the test. Until my arrival you were following a 
beaten track in your ignorance. You could not recognize the truth from the 
falsehood; you had no criterion for judging the genuine from the counterfeit; 
your worst people were lording over your best people, who were rolling in the 
dust. But now a criterion has come against which you will all be judged and 
assessed. Now a balance has been set up publicly, which will weigh everybody 
according to his true worth. Now both the truth and the falsehood have been made 
manifest. Whoever accepts the truth will weigh heavy whether he was not being 
held even worth a farthing so far; and whoever persists in falsehood will not 
weigh a gramme even though he was being esteemed as the chief of the chiefs 
before this. Now the judgment will not be based on the nobility or otherwise of 
the family one came of, or the abundance of the means and resources that one 
possessed, or one's physical strength but on this whether one accepted the truth 
gracefully or preferred to remain attached to falsehood."<br><br>62That is, nine 
chiefs of the tribes each of whom had a band of followers with him. <br><br>
63"The guardian": the chief of the Prophet Salih's tribe, who, according to the 
ancient tribal tradition and custom, could make a claim to blood vengeance. The 
same was the position in Makkah of the Holy Prophet's uncle, Abu Talib. The 
Quraish were hesitant that if they attacked and killed the Holy Prophet, Abu 
Talib, the chief of Bani Hashim, would come out with a claim to blood vengeance 
on behalf of his clan.<br><br>64This precisely was the kind of plot which the 
Makkan chiefs of the clans were devising against the Holy Prophet, and they 
devised the same ultimately on the occasion of migration (Hijrah) to kill him. 
They decided that men from all the clans would attack him in a body so that the 
Bani Hashim could not hold any one of the clans as responsible for the murder, 
and, therefore, would find it impossible to fight all of them at one and the 
same time. <br><br>65That is, "Before they could make the night attack on the 
Prophet Salih at the appointed time Allah sent down His scourge which destroyed 
their whole nation completely. It appears that they made this plot after 
hamstringing the she-camel. According to Surah Hud: 65, when they had killed the 
she-camel, Prophet Salih gave them a notice to enjoy life in their houses for 
three more days, for then they would be seized by the torment. At this they 
might have thought that the torment with which Salih threatened them might come 
or might not, but they must take We vengeance on Salih himself. Therefore, most 
probably they chose We same night for We attack which Allah had appointed for 
sending down We torment, and thus were struck down by Allah even before they 
could touch We Prophet Salih."<br><br>66That is, "The ignorant people will say, 
`There is no link between We Prophet Salih and his she-camel and We earthquake 
which struck We people of Thamud. These Wings have Weir natural causes. Their 
occurrence or otherwise has nothing to do with We piety and wickedness of the 
people of a place, with Weir high-handedness or Weir show of mercy. It is 
meaningless merely to say that such and such a city or land was filled with sin 
and wickedness, and therefore, it was overwhelmed by flood, or its habitation 
turned upside down by an earthquake, or it was ruined by a sudden disaster'." 
But We people who possess knowledge know that this universe is not being ruled 
by a deaf and blind God, but by an All-Wise, All-Knowing One Who is deciding We 
destinies. His decisions are not subject to physical causes, but We physical 
causes are subject to His will. His decisions to debase or exalt nations are not 
taken blindly but with wisdom and justice. In His Book of Law Were is also 
included We principle of retribution, according to which the wicked are made to 
suffer for Weir evil deeds even in this world, on moral grounds. The people who 
are aware of these realities, cannot explain away We occurrence of an earthquake 
by citing physical and natural causes; they will rather look upon them as the 
scourge of warning for themselves, and they will learn lessons from it. They 
will try to understand those moral causes because of which the Creator 
annihilated a flourishing nation, which He Himself had created. They will divert 
Weir conduct and attitude from We track that brings Allah's wrath to We way that 
joins them to His mercy. <br><br>67For comparison, See Al-A`raf: 80-84; Hud, 
74-83, Al-Hijr: 57-77, Al-Anbiya': 71-75, Ash-Shu`ara': 160-174, Al-`Ankabut: 
28-75, As-Saffat: 133138, Al-Qamar: 33-39. <br><br>68This can have several 
meanings and probably all are implied: (1) `That you are not unaware of this 
act's being wicked, but you commit it knowing it to be so"; (2) "You are also 
not unaware that the man has not been created for the man's sex satisfaction but 
the woman, and the distinction between them (man and woman) is not such as you 
cannot perceive, yet with open eyes you commit this abominable act." (3) "You 
indulge in this indecency publicly when there are people watching you", as 
stated in Surah `Ankbut: 29, thus: " ..... and you indulge in indecencies in 
your assemblies." <br><br>69The word jahalat here has been used in the sense of 
folly and stupidity. But even if it is taken in the sense of ignorance and lack 
of knowledge, it will mean: "You do not know the evil consequences of your acts. 
You only know that you are deriving sensual pleasure, but you do not know what 
severe punishment awaits you for this criminal and heinous pleasure-seeking. The 
scourge of Allah is ready to strike you but you are engaged in a senseless, 
filthy game with impunity.<br><br>70That is, "The Prophet Lot had already been 
instructed not to take the woman along because she had to be destroyed along 
with her people."<br><br>71From here starts the second discourse, and this is 
its introductory sentence. This introduction teaches how the Muslims should 
begin a speech. That is why the truly Islamic-minded people have always been 
starting their speeches and discourses with the praise of Allah and salutation 
on His righteous servants. But now this is looked upon as characteristic of 
bigotry, and the present-day Muslim speakers have no idea of starting their 
speech with these words, or feel shy of doing so.<br><br>72Superficially the 
question whether Allah is better or the false deities appears to be odd. As a 
matter of fact, there can be no question of goodness in the false gods and, 
therefore, they cannot be compared to Allah. As for the polytheists, even they 
had no misconception that Allah could be compared to their gods. But they were 
asked this question in order to be warned against their error. For obviously 
none in the world would do anything unless he saw some good in it. Now if the 
polytheists served their deities and implored them for their needs instead of 
Allah, and presented their offerings before them, this would be meaningless 
unless they perceived some good in them. That is why they have been explicitly 
asked to consider whether Allah is better or their deities, for they could not 
face and answer this forth-right question. Even the most hardened polytheist 
among them could not venture to say that their deities were better. But if they 
acknowledged that Allah is better it would demolish their whole creed, for then 
it would be unreasonable to adopt the inferior against the superior creed. The 
Meaning of the Qur'an Thus, the Qur'an at the very outset made the opponents 
helpless. After this, pointed questions have been asked, one after the other, 
about the manifestations of the power and creation of Allah to the effect: 
"Whose works are these? Is there besides Allah any other god also associated 
with these works'? If not, why have you then set up these others as your 
deities?"<br><br>According to traditions, whenever the Holy Prophet recited this 
verse, he would immediately respond to it, saying: "Nay, but Allah is better, 
and He alone is the Everlasting and Exalted and High."<br><br>73No one from 
among the mushriks could answer that someone other than Allah had done these 
works, or someone else was Allah's associate in doing these. The Qur'an at other 
places says with respect to the pagans of Makkah and the Arab mushrikin: "If you 
ask them, 'Who has created the heavens and the earth?' they will surely say: 
'The All-Mighty, the All-Knowing One has created them'." (Az-Zukhruf: 9) "And if 
you ask them, Who has created them? they will surely say, 'Allah'." (Az-Zukhruf: 
87), "If you ask them, 'Who sent down rain water from the sky and thereby raised 
the dead earth back to life ?' They will surely say, 'Allah'." (Al-`Ankabut: 
63). "Ask them: Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? Who has 
power over these faculties of hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living 
from the dead and the dead from the living? Who controls and directs the system 
of the universe?' They will surely say, 'Allah'." (Yunus: 31 ). Not only the 
polytheists of Arabia but of the whole world generally acknowledged, and 
acknowledge even today, that Allah is the Creator of the universe and He alone 
controls and directs its system. Therefore, none of them could answer this 
question even obstinately for the sake of the argument that their deities were 
Allah's associates in those works, for if he had done so, thousands of his own 
people would have belied him saying that, that was not their belief.<br><br>This 
and the other questions that follow not only contain a refutation of the creed 
of shirk (polytheism) but of atheism as well. For example, in this first very 
question, it has been asked, "Who has sent down rainwater and caused to spring 
up by it beautiful gardens?" Just consider whether the presence of the 
substances essential for the growth of countless kinds of plant life, in the 
soil or near the soil, and the existence in water of those very qualities which 
are in accordance with the requirements of animal and vegetable life, and the 
evaporation of this water again and again from the seas, and its condensation 
and raining regularly in different parts of the earth from time to time, and the 
coordination between the soil and the air, the water, the temperature;.etc., 
conducive to proper growth of plant life and fulfillment of the countless 
requirements of every sort of animal life, could be just accidental, or the 
result of the wise scheming and planning the supreme power and will of an 
All-Wise Designer. And is it possible that this accident should continue to 
recur constantly for millions and millions of years on end? Only an obstinate 
person who has been blinded by prejudice will regard it as accidental, for no 
truth loving, sensible person can make such a senseless claim or accept it.<br>
<br>74It is not a simple thing for the earth to be a place of rest for the 
countless kinds of different creations living on it. If man looks into the wise 
harmony and coordination with which this sphere of the earth has been 
established, he is simply amazed and starts feeling that these harmonies and 
concordances and relations could not be brought about without the grand design 
of an All-Wise, All Knowing and All-Powerful God. This sphere of the earth is 
floating in space and is not resting on anything, yet there is no commotion and 
no vibration in its movement. Had there been any vibration in it, such as we 
experience during an earthquake, life could not exist here. This sphere comes 
before the sun and hides from it regularly, which causes the alternation of the 
day and night. Had it turned the same face perpetually towards the sun and kept 
the other side always hidden, no life could be possible here, for on the bright 
side all life would have been shriveled up, and on the dark side all life would 
have been frozen to death. The sphere is enveloped by a five hundred mile thick 
atmosphere, which protects it against the' continual bombardment of meteors, 
otherwise the twenty million meteors on the average, which dart towards the 
earth daily at 30 miles per second, would have caused such destruction as would 
not have allowed any man animal or tree to survive. The same atmosphere controls 
the temperature, raises clouds from the oceans, carries water to different parts 
of the earth and provides the required gases that sustain the human, animal and 
plant life. Without it the earth could not become a fit place of rest for any 
kind of animal life. Just under the earth's surface all those minerals and 
chemicals which are essential to the survival of vegetable and animal life have 
been provided in abundance. Wherever these natural resources do not exist, the 
land there cannot sustain any kind of life. A great store of water has been 
arranged on the earth in the form of oceans, rivers, lakes, springs and 
underground channels and snow on the mountains which melts and flows down in the 
form of rivers. Without such an arrangement there could be no life. Then the 
earth has been endowed with an appropriate gravitational pull by which it keeps 
the water and the air and all other things found on it attracted to it. If this 
pull had been a little less strong, it could not have stopped the air and the 
water from escaping. It would also have so much increased the temperature that 
life here would have become difficult. On the other hand, if the gravitational 
pull had been a little stronger, the atmosphere would have been denser, its 
pressure would have increased, evaporation would have become difficult and rains 
impossible; the cold would have increased and less areas on earth would have 
been inhabitable; men and animals would have been shorter in size but heavier in 
weight, which would have made movement difficult. Besides, this sphere has been 
located at a suitable distance from the sun, which is most appropriate for the 
population here. If the distance had been longer, the earth would have received 
less of heat, the climate would have been much colder, the seasons much longer 
and the earth would be hardly inhabitable. On the other hand, if the distance 
had been shorter, the intensity of the heat along with other factors would have 
rendered it unfit for the kind of life man is living here.<br><br>These are a 
few of those harmonies and concordances due to which earth has become a place of 
rest for its population. A man with a little common sense who is aware of these 
facts cannot imagine for a moment that these concordances have come into 
existence without the design of an All-Wise Creator, as a mere accident, nor can 
he ever conceive that a god or goddess, jinn or prophet, saint or angel, could 
have had any hand in the creation and bringing into operation of this grand 
design. <br><br>75That is, the bodies of sweet and saline waters that exist on 
the earth but do not , intermingle. Underground water channels mostly flow 
separately with sweet water and saline water side by side. Even in the middle of 
the bitter seas there exist at some places springs of sweet water; their current 
remains separate from the sea water and the sea passengers obtain their drinking 
water from it. (For further explanation, see, E.N. 68 of Surah Al-Furqan) .<br>
<br>76The Arab polytheists themselves knew and acknowledged that Allah alone 
could avert a disaster. Therefore, the Qur'an reminds them again and again that 
they implore Allah alone for help when they are confronted by a calamity. But 
when the calamity is removed, they start invoking others besides Allah. (For 
details, see E.N.'s. 29 to 41 of Al-An`am, Yunus: 21-22, E.N. 46 of An-Nahl, and 
E.N. 84 of Bani Isra'il). And this is not only true of the Arab polytheists but 
of all polytheists; so much so that even the Russian atheists who are regularly 
campaigning against God-Worship, had to invoke God when in the Second World War 
they were tightly encircled by the German forces.<br><br>77This has two 
meanings: (1) "He raises one generation after the other and one nation after the 
other"; and (2) "He gives you power and authority to rule in the earth"<br><br>
78That is, "He has made such arrangements by means of the stars that you can 
find your way even in the darkness of the night." This is also because of the 
wise planning of Allah that He has created such means by which man can determine 
his direction and the way to his destination in his journeys by sea and land. In 
the day time he is guided by different land-marks and the direction of sunrise 
and sun-set, and in the dark nights by the stars. In Surah An-Nahl this has been 
counted among the bounties of Allah: "He has placed land-marks to direct people, 
and by the stars, too, they are guided aright." (v. 16)<br><br>79"Allah's mercy" 
the rain whose coming is promptly foretold by the winds.<br><br>80The simple 
fact hat has been expressed in this one sentence is so vast in meaning and 
detail that as one considers it more and more deeply one goes on getting new and 
ever new proofs of Allah's existence and His unity. to the first place, take the 
question of the creation itself. Man by his knowledge has not been able to 
discover what is life, how and where form it comes. So far the admitted 
scientific fact is that the mere arrangement of inanimate matter by itself 
cannot bring about life. Though the atheists assume, unscientifically, that life 
comes into existence automatically when all the elements essential for its 
creation combine together accidentally in the right proportion, yet if the 
mathematical law of chance is applied to it, the possibility of its occurrence 
comes to naught. All attempts made so far to produce animate matter out of 
inanimate matter experimentally in the laboratory have met with utter failure in 
spite of employing every possible care. At the most what has been created is 
DNA, which is the basic constituent of the living cell. This is the essence of 
life but not life itself. Life in itself even now is a miracle which cannot be 
explained scientifically except by saying that it is the result of a Creator's 
will and command and design.<br><br>Furthermore, life does not exist in a 
solitary form but in a limitless variety of forms. Man has so far discovered 
more or less a million species of animals and two hundred thousand species of 
plants on the earth, which in their constitution and special characteristics are 
so clearly and absolutely different from one another, and have been maintaining 
their distinctive features since the earliest known times so consistently that 
no Darwin could ever give any rational explanation of this great variety of life 
except the existence of the creative design of One God. Not a link has so far 
been discovered between any two species, which might have broken up the form of 
the characteristics and constitution of one species and might be struggling to 
attain the characteristics and constitution of another species. The whole record 
of the fossils is without such a precedent, and among the existing animals also 
there is no such "eunuch" in its physical form. Any member of any species that 
exists is found with the distinctive features of its own species, and every 
story that is invented and announced from time to tune about the discovery of 
some missing link is destroyed by the facts themselves. Therefore, the 
inevitable fact is that it is the All-Wise Designer, the Planner of creation, 
its Enforcer and its Fashioner, Who has endowed life with all its countless 
different forms.<br><br>This was about the beginning of the creation. Now let us 
consider its reproduction. The Creator has placed in the constitution and 
snake-up of every animal and vegetable species such a wonderful mechanism, which 
goes on producing through its countless members an endless race exactly with its 
own distinctive form and nature and characteristics, and it never has happened 
even by mistake that in these millions and millions of tiny sex workshops a 
certain workshop of a species may have turned out a specimen of a different 
species. The observations of modern Genetics in this connection present 
wonderful facts. Every plant has been so endowed with the capability of 
procreating its species that the new generation should possess all the 
distinctive characteristics of its own species and its every member should be 
distinguished in its special features from the members of all other species. 
This element for the survival of the species and its procreation is contained in 
a part of a cell of every plant, which can be seen with effort only through a 
most powerful microscope. This tiny engineer directs the whole development the 
plant precisely and definitely on the way which is the way .of its own 
distinctive species. That is why all the plants that have emerged from a grain 
of wheat arty where in the world have in turn produced only wheat. In no climate 
and in no region has it ever happened that from the whole race of a grain of 
wheat even a single grain of barley might have emerged. The same is the case 
with animals and men. None of them has been created just for once, but on an 
inconceivably high scale a huge factory of reproduction is functioning every 
where, which is constantly bringing into existence, from the members of every 
species, countless other members of the same species. If one considers the 
microscopic germ of procreation which along with all the distinctive features 
and hereditary characteristics of its species is found in a small portion of its 
tiny self and thou looks at the extremely delicate and complex physiological 
system and the subtle, intricate processes by which the procreative seed of 
every member of every species produces a member of the same species, one cannot 
conceive for a moment that such a tine and subtle system could come into being 
by itself, and then keep on functioning by itself in millions and millions of 
the members of different species. This thing stands in need of an All-Wise 
Designer not only for its beginning but for its proper and perpetual functioning 
also it needs an Administrator Who is at once Wise and Ever-Living and 
Self-Subsistent, Who is ever watching and guiding the work of these workshops.<br>
<br>These facts destroy the very basis of an atheist's denial of God as also of 
a polytheist's creed of polytheism. A foolish person only can think that an 
angel or a jinn or a prophet or a saint has any hand in this work of God, but no 
unbiased person possessed of a little common sense can ever say that this huge 
workshop of production and reproduction with all its underlying wisdom and order 
started working just accidentally and has since been working so automatically.<br>
<br>81The question of the provision of sustenance also is not so simple as a 
person may feel it to be from a cursory study of this brief sentence. There 
exist on this earth millions of animal and vegetable species, each comprising 
billions of members having different food requirements. The Creator has arranged 
the means of sustenance for each species in such abundance and so within easy 
reach that members of no species ever go without food. Then the agencies of the 
earth and sky which combine and work together in this system are varied and 
countless. Unless there is the right kind of coordination and harmony between 
the heat, light, air, water and the diverse substances of the earth, not a 
single particle of food can be produced.'<br><br>Can anyone conceive that this 
wise system could come about just accidentally. without the intelligent planning 
and design of an All-Wise Creator? And can anybody in his senses imagine that in 
this system there could be any hand of a Jinn or an angel or the spirit of a 
pious man? <br><br>82That is, "You should either bring a proof to show that 
someone else is an associate of Allah in these works, or, if that is not 
possible, you should at least explain by an argument why you should worship and 
serve any other god beside Allah, when One Allah alone has done, and is doing, 
all these works."<br><br>83In the preceding verses, arguments have been given to 
prove that Allah is the One and only Deity when considered from the viewpoint of 
creation, design and provision of the means of sustenance. Now in this verse it 
is being told that from the viewpoint of knowledge too, which is an important 
attribute of Godhead, Allah is Unique and without associate. Whatever creations 
are therein the heavens and the earth, whether angels or jinns, prophets and 
saints, or other men and other creatures, they have only limited knowledge. 
Something is hidden from all of them. The All-Knowing One is only Allah, from 
Whom nothing whatever of this universe is hidden, and Who knows every thing of 
the past and the present and the future.<br><br>The word ghaib means something 
hidden and covered. As a term it implies everything which is unknown, and beyond 
one's sphere of knowledge and information. There are many things in the world 
which individually are known to some human beings and. unknown to others. And 
there are many others which taken as a whole have never been known to any of 
mankind, nor are known at present; nor will be known in the future: The same is 
the case with the jinns and the angels and other kinds of creation: certain 
things are known to some of them and hidden from others, and many things hidden 
from all of them and known to none. All kinds of hidden things are only known to 
One Being, the All-Knowing Allah. For Him nothing is unknown everything is known 
and evident.<br><br>In order to bring out this reality the method of the 
question as employed above with regard to creation, design and sustenance of the 
universe has not been adopted here. The reason is that the manifestations of 
those attributes are clear and evident which everyone sees, and which even the 
pagans and polytheists acknowledged, and do even today, that they are the works 
of Allah. So, the argument adopted above was: When all these works, as you 
admit, are being done by Allah, and no one else is His partner in these, why 
have you then made others His associates in Divinity, and in His worship? 
However, the attribute of knowledge . has no perceptible manifestation which may 
be referred to and pointed out. It can be comprehended only by thought and 
reflection. Therefore, it has been put forward as an assertion instead of a 
question. Now it is for every intelligent person to think and consider for 
himself whether it is reasonable to believe that there should be any other than 
Allah, who is all-knowing, i.e. who knows all those conditions and things and 
realities which existed in the universe in the past; or exist now; or will exist 
in the future. And if there is none other who is all knowing, and cannot be, 
then is it reasonable to believe that any of those who are not aware fully of 
the realities and conditions and circumstances can become the answerer of the 
people's prayers, fulfiller of their needs and remover of their hardships ?<br>
<br>There is a subtle relationship between Divinity and the knowledge of the 
unseen and hidden. Since the earliest times in whatever being has man imagined 
the presence of an attribute of Godhead, he has taken it for granted that it 
knows everything and nothing is hidden from it. In other words, it is 
self-evident for man to believe that making or marring the destinies, answering 
the prayers, fulfilling the needs and helping everyone in need of help, can be 
the work of the being who knows everything and from whom nothing is hidden. That 
is why whomever man has regarded as possessor of the powers and authority of 
Godhead he has necessarily regarded him as the knower of all hidden things as 
well. For his intellect testifies rightly that knowledge and authority are 
inter-dependent. Now if it is a fact that none but God is the Creator and the 
Designer and the Answerer of the prayers and the Providence, as has been proved 
in the foregoing verses, then it is also a self-evident reality that none but 
God is the Knower of the hidden things. After all, who in his senses could 
imagine that an angel or a jinn or a prophet or a saint or any other creature 
would be knowing where and what kinds of animals existed in the oceans and in 
the atmosphere and under the layers of the earth and upon its surface? And what 
is the correct number of the planets in the heavens? And what kinds of creatures 
exist in each of them? And where is each one of these creatures living and what 
are its requirements? All this should necessarily be known to Allah, because He 
has created them and He alone has to watch over their conditions and control 
their affairs and arrange for their sustenance. But how can some one else with 
his limited self have this vast and all-embracing knowledge and what has he to 
do with the functions of creation and sustenance that he should know these 
things?<br><br>Then this quality is also not divisible in the sense that a 
person, for instance, may be the knower of everything on the earth, or the 
knower of everything concerning human beings only, on the earth. It is in the 
same way indivisible as are God's Creativity and His Providence and His 
Self-Subsistence indivisible. After all, how can it be possible for one to know 
all the affairs and all the conditions and states of all human beings who have 
been born in the world since the beginning of creation, and will be born till 
Resurrection, from the time their mothers conceived them till the time they will 
breath their last ? And how and why will he know all this ? Is he the creator of 
these countless multitudes ? Did he create their seed in their fathers' 
sperm-drop ? Did he mold and shape them in their mother's womb? Did he arrange 
for their normal birth'? Did he make the destiny of each one of them? Is he 
responsible for taking decisions with regard to their life and death, their 
health and ill-health, their prosperity and adversity, and their rise and fall 
in the world ? And since when did he become responsible for it? Since before his 
own birth or since after it ? And how can these responsibilities remain confined 
only to human beings? This is only a part of the universal administration of the 
heavens and the earth. The Being Who is controlling the whole universe is the 
Being Who alone can be responsible for the creation and death of men, for 
restricting and extending their provisions and for making and marring their 
destinies.<br><br>That is why it is a fundamental article of Islam that none 
other than Allah is the Knower of the hidden and unseen things. Allah may 
disclose whatever of His information He wills to whomsoever of His servants He 
pleases and bless him with the knowledge of one or more of the hidden things as 
a whole. Being the Knower of all hidden and unseen things is the attribute only 
of Allah, Who is the Lord of all creation "He alone has the keys of the `unseen' 
of which none has the knowledge but He." (Al-An`am: 59) "Allah alone has the 
knowledge of the Hour: He alone sends down the rain and He alone knows what is 
(taking shape) in the wombs of the mothers. No living being knows what he will 
earn the next day, nor does anybody know in what land he will die." (Luqman 34) 
"He knows what is before the people and also what is hidden from them; and they 
cannot comprehend anything of His knowledge save whatever He Himself may please 
to reveal." (Al Baqarah: 255).<br><br>The Qur'an does not rest content with this 
general and absolute negation of the knowledge of the hidden and unseen for the 
different forms of creation, but about the Prophets in particular, and the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) himself it clearly says that they 
do not possess the knowledge of the hidden and unseen, and that they were given 
only that much knowledge of the hidden by Allah as was necessary to enable them 
to carry out the duties of Prophethood. Surah Al-An`am.: 50, Al-A'raf: 187, At-Taubah: 
101, Hud: 31, AlAhzab: 63, Al-Ahqaf: 9, At-Tahrim: 3 and Al-Jinn: 26-28 do not 
leave any room for doubt in this regard.<br><br>All these elucidations of the 
Qur'an support and explain the verse under discussion after which there remains 
no doubt that looking upon another than Allah as the knower of the hidden and 
unseen and believing that someone else also possesses the knowledge of all the 
past and future events, is an absolutely un-Islamic belief. Bukhari, Muslim, 
Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Imam Ahmad, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abu Hatim have cited this saying 
of Hadrat `A'ishah. through authentic reporters: "Whoever claimed that the Holy 
Prophet (peace be upon him) knew what was going to happen the next day, accused 
Allah of lying, for Allah says: O Prophet, say, `None in the heavens and the 
earth has the knowledge of the hidden and unseen but Allah'." Ibn al-Mundhir has 
reported this on the authority of 'Ikrimah, the well-known pupil of Hadrat 
'Abdullah bin 'Abbas: "A person asked the Holy Prophet: O Muhammad, when will 
Resurrection be? And our territory is suffering from famine: when will it rain ? 
And my wife is pregnant: what will she deliver, a boy or a girl? And I know what 
I have earned today; but what shall I earn tomorrow? And I know where I was 
born, but where shall I die?" In reply, the Holy Prophet recited verse 34 of 
Surah Luqman as cited above. Then the well-known Tradition as reported in 
Bukhari; and Muslim and other works of Hadith also supports the same. According 
to it one of the questions asked by Angel Gabriel from the Holy Prophet when he 
sat among the Companions in human shape before him, was: "When will Resurrection 
be?" The Holy Prophet replied: "The one being questioned knows no better than 
the one questioning." Then added, "This is one of those five things whose 
knowledge is possessed by none but Allah," and then he recited the above-cited 
verse of Surah Luqman .<br><br>84That is "Those others about whom it is thought 
that they possess the knowledge of the hidden and, therefore, are regarded as 
partners in Divinity, are themselves unaware of their future. They do not know 
when will Resurrection be when Allah will raise them up again.<br><br>85After 
warning the people about their basic errors with regard to Divinity, it is being 
said that the reason why these people are involved in these errors is not that 
they have reached this conclusion after serious thought and deliberation that 
there exist other beings also who are Allah's associates in His Divinity, but 
the actual reason is that they have never considered this matter seriously. As 
they are unaware of the Hereafter, or are in doubt about it, or are blind to it, 
their heedlessness of the Hereafter has developed in them an utterly 
irresponsible attitude. They are not at all serious about the universe and the 
real problems of their own lives. They do not bother to know what reality is and 
whether their philosophy of life accords with that reality or not. For, 
according to them, in the end the polytheist and the atheist, the monotheist and 
the agnostic, all will become one with the dust after death, and nothing will 
bear any fruit.<br><br>The theme of the Hereafter is contained in this sentence 
of the preceding verse: "They do not know when they will be raised back to 
life." In that sentence it was said that those who are made deities-the angels, 
jinns, prophets, saints, etc., do not themselves know when will Resurrection be. 
Here three things have been said about the common polytheists and the atheists: 
(1) They do not at all know whether there will be any Hereafter or not; (2) this 
lack of information on their part is not due to the reason that they were never 
informed of this, but because they did not believe in the information given to 
them and doubted its authenticity; and (3) they never bothered to consider with 
due thought and seriousness the arguments that were advanced about the coming of 
the Hereafter, but they preferred to remain blind to it. <br><br>86This brief 
sentence contains two strong arguments for the Hereafter as well as admonition:<br>
<br>Firstly, those communities who rejected the Hereafter could not help 
becoming criminals: they lived irresponsibly; they committed cruelties and all 
kinds of sin; and ultimately their moral depravity led them to utter ruin. This 
continuous experience of human history which is testified by the doomed 
communities all over the world, clearly shows that belief and unbelief in the 
Hereafter has a deep relationship with the soundness or the unsoundness of human 
behavior. Belief in it generates sound behavior and denial of it unsound 
behavior. This is a clear proof of the fact that belief in it is in accordance 
with the reality; that is why belief helps life to follow the right path. And 
rejection of it is against the reality; that is why rejection leads life into 
crooked alleys.<br><br>Secondly, the destruction of the communities, which 
became criminals, one after the other, in the long experience of history is a 
clear pointer to the fact that this universe is not being ruled by the deaf and 
blind and senseless forces, but this is a wise system which is functioning 
according to the unalterable law of retribution, which is dealing with the human 
communities only on moral grounds, in which no community is given long enough 
rope to commit whatever evil it likes and continue to enjoy life and commit 
injustices after it has once risen to power and prosperity. But when a wicked 
community happens to reach a certain stage, a mighty hand topples it from power 
and hurls it into the abyss of ignominy. Anyone who realizes this fact can have 
no doubt that the same law of retribution calls for the establishment of a new 
world after this world, where all individuals and nations and the whole mankind 
collectively should be rewarded and punished for their deeds. For the 
requirements of justice cannot be fulfilled only by the destruction of a wicked 
nation; this does not in any way redress the grievances of the oppressed people; 
this does not punish those who had enjoyed life and left the world before the 
coming down of the scourge; this does not also take to task those wicked people 
who went on leaving behind them legacies of immoralities and deviations for the 
coming generations. The torment that visited the nation only put a stop to the 
further tyrannies of its last generation. The court has not yet started working, 
to punish every wicked person for the evil done, to compensate every oppressed 
person for the losses incurred, and to reward all those who stood by the right 
against the onslaught of evil, endeavored to reform things and faced 
persecutions in this way throughout their lives. All this should necessarily 
happen at some time. For the continuous operation in the world of the law of 
retribution clearly points to the temperament and technique of the ruling 
government of the universe that it judges human deeds by moral standards and 
punishes and rewards them accordingly.<br><br>Besides these two arguments, the 
aspect of admonition in this verse is: "Learn lessons from the fate of the 
guilty people of the past, and do not persist in the foolish belief of the 
denial of the Hereafter, which, in fact, was responsible for making them 
criminals. "<br><br>87That is, "You have done full justice to your mission of 
preaching. Now if they do not listen to you, and wish to persist in their folly 
and deserve the Divine torment, you should not consume yourself by being 
distressed and grieved at their condition. Then, why should you feel vexed at 
their mean machinations that they are devising in order to fight the truth and 
to frustrate your movement of return `? You have Allah's power at your back. If 
they do not listed to you, they will only be harming themselves, not you." <br>
<br>88The same threat which is implied in the preceding verse. What they meant 
was: "When will the scourge with which you threaten us overtake us? Why are we 
not being punished when we have not only rejected you but have also done 
whatever we could to frustrate your mission'?" <br><br>89This is a royal way of 
saying a thing. When words like "perhaps", "no wonder", etc. occur in the Divine 
discourse, they do not contain any sense of doubt, but express Allah's 
Independence and Self-Sufficiency. Allah's power is so great that His willing a 
thing and its happening is one and the same thing. It is inconceivable that He 
should will a thing and it should not happen. Therefore, when He says, "No 
wonder it may well be so", it means, "It will certainly be so if you do not mend 
your ways."<br><br>90That is, "It is Allah's mercy that He does not seize the 
culprit immediately after his commission of a crime but gives him respite to 
reform himself. But most people are not grateful for this, and do not utilize 
the period of respite for their reformation. On the contrary, when they see that 
they have not been taken to task immediately, they form the idea that there is 
none to call theta to account. Therefore, they are free to do whatever they like 
and they should not listen to any word of admonition".<br><br>91That is, "He is 
not only aware of their open misdeeds but is also fully aware of the malice and 
spite which they are concealing in their hearts and the evil plots which they 
are making secretly. Therefore, when the time comes to call them to account, 
they will be taken to task for everything done and thought."<br><br>92Here by 
"Book" is not meant the Qur'an, but the Divine Record in which everything has 
been registered.<br><br>93This sentence is connected with the foregoing theme as 
well as with what follows. In the first case, it means that it is a 
manifestation of the knowledge of the All-Knowing God that He is explaining 
through a gentile (non-Jew) in this Qur'an the reality of those events which are 
a part of the Israelite history, and which are being disputed by the learned men 
of the Israelites themselves. (The examples of this have been given in the early 
part of this Surah as explained in our Notes). In the second case, it means that 
just as Allah has decided those disputes, so He will decide this dispute also 
which is going on between the Holy Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace be upon 
him) and his opponents as to who is following the truth and who the falsehood. 
So, a few years after the revelation of these verses the Decision came before 
the whole world. In the same land of Arabia and in the same clan of the Quraish 
there was not left a single person who was not convinced that it was Muhammad 
(upon whom be Allah's peace) who was following the Truth and not Abu Jahl and 
Abu Lahab. Even the children of these people admitted that their fathers were in 
the wrong. <br><br>94That is, "It is Mercy and Guidance for those who accept the 
message of the Qur'an and believe in what it presents. Such people will be saved 
from the errors in which their own people are involved. They will find the right 
way of life by means of the Qur'an and they will be blessed with such favors by 
Allah, which the disbelievers among the Quraish cannot even imagine today." This 
shower of Allah's mercy was also witnessed by the world after a few years. The 
same people who were living unknown lives in a corner of the Arabian desert and 
could at the most become successful raiders in the state of unbelief, suddenly 
emerged after their belief in the Qur'an as the guides of the world, leaders of 
the nations, makers of human civilization and rulers over a vast part of the 
world.<br><br>95"Between these people": Between the disbelievers of the Quraish 
and the believers.<br><br>96That is, "Neither can any power withhold His 
judgment from being enforced, nor is there any chance of an error in His 
judgment." <br><br>97"The dead" the ones whose consciences are dead and whose 
stubbornness, obstinacy and love of the usage and custom have deprived them of 
the sense of discrimination between the Truth and falsehood.<br><br>98That is, 
"Who not only close their ears against what you say, but slink away from the 
place where they fear they aught hear what you say. <br><br>99That is, "It is 
none of your job to pull them forcibly to the right way and drag them along with 
you. You can only tell them by the word of mouth and by your example that this 
is the right way and the way they are following is the wrong way But how can you 
guide the one who has closed his eyes and is not at all inclined to see 
anything?" <br><br>100That is, "...when Resurrection which they are being 
promised will approach." <br><br>101According to Ibn `Umar, this will happen 
when there remains no one in the world to command the people to do good and 
forbid them to do evil. Ibn Marduyah has reported a Hadith on the authority of 
Abu Said Khudri; according to which the latter heard the same thing from the 
Holy Prophet himself. This shows that when man gives up the duty of exhorting 
others to do good and forbidding them to do evil, Allah will bring forth a beast 
to serve as the final warning just before Resurrection. This, however, is not 
clear whether it will be just one beast, or a particular species of beasts, who 
will spread all over the earth. The words daabbat-an-min-al-ard might contain 
both the meanings. In any case, what it will say will be: "The people did not 
believe Allah's Revelations in which Resurrection was foretold. Now the same 
Resurrection is about to come; Iet everyone know that what Allah said was true". 
The sentence, "The people did not believe in Our Revelations", is either a part 
of the beast's own speech, or Allah's narration of its words. If these are its 
own words, the word "Our" will be understood in the style of an official who 
speaks on behalf of his government and not on his personal behalf. In the second 
case, since Allah is narrating the beast's words, He has used "Our Revelations" 
in the normal sense.<br><br>As to the time and occasion of the appearance of 
this beast, the Holy Prophet has said: "The sun will rise in the west and the 
beast will suddenly appear in the open daylight. Whichever of these signs 
appears first, it will be closely followed by the other." (Muslim) In the other 
traditions related in Muslim, Ibn Majah, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, etc. the Holy 
Prophet foretold that the signs of Resurrection-emergence of the Anti-Christ (Dajjal), 
appearance of the beast, smoke and the rising of the sun in the west -will 
appear one after the other.<br><br>As for the nature, general appearance, place 
of appearance and other details about the beast, contradictory traditions have 
been reported, which only cause confusion and are not relevant to the object for 
which this thing has been mentioned in the Qur'an.<br><br>As regards the beast's 
speaking to human beings in a human language, this will be a manifestation of 
the power of Allah, Who can give the power of speech to anything He pleases. He 
will give this power only to a beast before the event of Resurrection, but when 
Resurrection will have taken place, each limb of man-his ears, his eyes, even 
his skin-will speak out and give evidence in the Court of Allah, as has been 
clearly stated in Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 20-21: "Then, when all will have reached 
there, their ears and their eyes and their very skins will bear witness against 
them concerning what they had been doing in the world. They will say to their 
skins, "Why have you borne witness against us?' They will reply, `The same God 
Who has given speech to everything has given us speech'." <br><br>102That is, 
"You did not deny My Revelations on the basis of some scientific investigation, 
which might have proved them to be false, but you denied them without any sound 
reason."<br><br>103That is, "If it is not so, can you then prove that you 
treated them as false only after a thorough scientific investigation through 
which you came to know that the reality was not that which was being presented 
in these verses?" <br><br>104That is, "Two out of the countless signs were such 
which they were observing at all times, whose benefits they were enjoying every 
moment, and which were not hidden even from a blind or deaf or dumb person. 
While they benefited by the rest at night and the opportunities afforded by the 
day, why did they not think that it is a system devised by an All-Wise Being, 
Who has established the relationship between the sun and the earth precisely to 
meet their requirements and needs ? This cannot be a mere accident, for it 
clearly manifests purposefulness, wisdom and planning, which cannot be the 
characteristic of the blind forces of nature, nor the work of many gods. It can 
only be a system established by the One Creator and Master and Disposer, Who is 
ruling over the earth, the moon, the sun and all other planets. From the 
observation of this single phenomenon they could judge that the alternation of 
the day and night testified to the truth that We have conveyed through Our 
Messenger and Our Book."<br><br>105That is, "It was not something 
incomprehensible either. There were among their own relatives, their own clan 
and their own brotherhood people like themselves, who had seen the same very 
Signs and believed that the creed of God worship and Tauhid towards which the 
Prophet was inviting them was precisely in accordance with the truth and 
reality."<br><br>106For a detailed discussion of the blowing of the Trumpet, see 
E.N. 47 of AI-An`am, E.N. 57 of Ibrahim, E.N. 78 of Ta Ha, E.N. 1 of Al-Hajj, 
E.N.'s. 46, 47 of Ya Sin and E.N. 79 of Az-Zumar. <br><br>107That is, "From such 
God you should not expect that after giving you the powers of intellect and 
discrimination and control over things, He will remain unaware of your deeds and 
actions and will not see how you have been using the delegated authority in the 
earth." <br><br>108The reward will be better in two ways: (1) It will be higher 
than what a person will actually deserve for his good deeds; and (2) it will be 
everlasting and for ever though the good act was temporary and its influence 
confined to a limited period only. <br><br>109That is, "Though the terrors of 
Resurrection will stun and confound the disbelievers, the believers will remain 
safe and secure from them, for everything in the Hereafter will be according to 
their expectations. They had already known from the messages brought by the 
Messengers of Allah that Resurrection will take place, and a new World will be 
established when everyone will be called to account for his deeds. Therefore, 
they will neither be bewildered nor alarmed, which will be the case with those 
who had denied this Day and retrained heedless of it, till their last breath in 
the world .They will also be satisfied because they had worked for this Day and 
had brought necessary provisions from the world for their success here. 
Therefore, they will not be stupefied and confounded as will be those who had 
invested all their energies and capabilities 'in their struggle for achieving 
worldly successes only, and had never thought that there would be life hereafter 
also for which they should make some provision. Contrary to them, the believers 
will be satisfied that the Day for the sake of which they had given up the 
unlawful benefits and pleasures of life and had undergone hardships and toil, 
had at last come, and they will not be deprived of the rewards of their works."<br>
<br>109aAt several places in the Qur'an it has been stated clearly that an evil 
will be punished in the Hereafter only to the extent of the evil committed, but 
a good act will be rewarded much more generously by Allah than what the doer 
will actually deserve for it. For more examples of this, see Surah Yunus: 26-27, 
AlQasas: 84. Al-'Ankabut: 7, Saba': 37-38, Al-Mu'min: 40.<br><br>110As this 
Surah was sent down at a stage when the message of Islam was confined to Makkah 
and its addressees were the people of that City only, it was said, "I have been 
commanded that I should worship the Lord of this City." And the characteristic 
of the Lord was stated to be that He had made that City sacred. This was meant 
to warn the disbelievers of Makkah, as if to say, " You may if you so like prove 
thankless to that God Who has done you the great favor of making this City of 
yours a haven of peace in the strife-ridden land of Arabia, and Who by His grace 
has made it the center of spiritual affiliation for the whole of Arabia, but I 
have been commanded to be grateful to him and bow down before Him. None of your 
deities had the power to make this City a sanctuary and make the quarrelsome and 
plundering tribes of Arabia have respect for it. I cannot abandon my real 
Benefactor and bow down before those who have done me no favor at all.<br></p>
