<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>This Surah takes its name from v. 27.<br><br>
<strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>As this Surah contains the 
characteristics of both the Makki and the Madani Surahs, the commentators have 
differed as to its period of revelation, but in the light of its style and 
themes we are of the opinion that a part of it (vv. 1-24) was sent down in the 
last stage of the Makki life of the Holy Prophet a little before migration and 
the rest (vv. 25-78) during the first stage of his Madani life. That is why this 
Surah combines the characteristics of both the Makki and the Madani Surahs.<br>
<br>The sudden change of the style from v. 25 shows that probably vv. 25-78 were 
sent down in the month of Zul-Hijjah in the very first year after Hijrah. This 
is indicated by vv. 25-41 and confirmed by the occasion of the revelation of vv. 
39-40. It appears that the month of Zul-Hijjah must have brought to the 
immigrants nostalgic memories of their homes in Makkah and naturally they must 
have thought of their Sacred City and of their Hajj congregation there, and 
grieved to think that the mushrik Quraish had debarred them from visiting the 
Sacred Mosque. Therefore, they might even have been praying for and expecting 
Divine permission to wage war against those tyrants who had expelled them from 
their homes and deprived them of visiting the House of Allah and made it 
difficult for them to follow the way of Islam. It was at this psychological 
occasion that these verses were sent down. That is why the purpose for which 
Masjid-al- Haram was built has been specifically mentioned. It has been made 
plain that Hajj(pilgrimage) had been enjoined for the worship of One Allah. But 
it is an irony that afterwards it had been dedicated to the rituals of shirk and 
the worshipers of One Allah had been debarred from visiting it. Therefore, 
permission for waging war against those tyrants has been given to oust them from 
there and to establish the righteous way of life for establishing virtue and 
eradicating evil. According to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Urwah bin Zubair, Zaid bin 
Aslam, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Qatadah and other great commentators, v. 39 is the 
first verse that grants the Muslims permission to wage war. Collections of 
Hadith and books on the life of the Holy Prophet confirm that after this 
permission actual preparations for war were started and the first expedition was 
sent to the coast of the Red Sea in Safar A.H. 2, which is known as the 
Expedition of Waddan or Al- Abwa.<br><br><strong>Subject Matter and Theme</strong><br>
<br>This Surah is addressed to: (1) The mushriks of Makkah, (2) the wavering 
Muslims, and (3) the True Believers. The mushriks have been warned in a forceful 
manner to this effect: "You have obdurately and impudently persisted in your 
ideas of ignorance and trusted in your deities instead of Allah, though they 
possess no power at all and you have repudiated the Divine Messenger. Now you 
will meet the same end as has been the doom of those like you before. You have 
only harmed yourselves by rejecting Our Prophet and by persecuting the best 
element of your own community; now your false deities shall not be able to save 
you from the wrath of God". At the same time, they have been admonished time and 
again for their creed of shirk and sound arguments have been given in favor of 
Tauhid and the Hereafter.<br><br>The wavering Muslims, who had embraced Islam 
but were not prepared to endure any hardship in its way, have been admonished to 
this effect: "What is this faith of yours? On the one hand, you are ready to 
believe in Allah and become His servants provided you are given peace and 
prosperity but, on the other, if you meet with afflictions and hardships in His 
Way, you discard your Allah and cease to remain His servant. You should bear in 
mind that this wavering attitude of yours cannot avert those misfortunes and 
losses which Allah has ordained for you."<br><br>As regards the true Believers, 
they have been addressed in two ways: (1) in a general way so as to include the 
common people of Arabia also, and (2) in an exclusive way:<br><br>The Believers 
have been told that the mushriks of Makkah had no right to debar them from 
visiting the Holy Mosque. They had no right to prevent anyone from performing 
Hajj because the Holy Mosque was not their private property. This objection was 
not only justified but it also acted as an effective political weapon against 
the Quraish. For it posed this question to the other clans of Arabia: Were the 
Quraish mere attendants of the Holy Mosque or its owners? It implied that if 
they succeeded in debarring the Muslims from Hajj without any protest from 
others, they would feel encouraged in future to debar from Hajj and Umrah the 
people of any other clan, who happened to have strained relations with the 
Quraish. In order to emphasize this point, the history of the construction of 
the Holy Mosque has been cited to show that it was built by Prophet Abraham by 
the Command of Allah and he had invited all the peoples to perform Hajj there. 
That is why those coming from outside had enjoyed equal rights by the local 
people from the very beginning. It has also been made clear that that House had 
not been built for the rituals of shirk but for the worship of One Allah. Thus 
it was sheer tyranny that the worship of Allah was being forbidden there while 
the worship of idols enjoyed full license.<br><br>In order to counteract the 
tyranny of the Quraish, the Muslims were allowed to fight with them. They were 
also given instructions to adopt the right and just attitude as and when they 
acquired power to rule in the land. Moreover, the Believers have been officially 
given the name of "Muslims", saying, "You are the real heirs to Abraham and you 
have been chosen to become witnesses of the Truth before mankind. Therefore you 
should establish salat and pay the zakat dues in order to become the best models 
of righteous life and perform Jihad for propagating the Word of Allah." (vv. 
41,77, 78.)<br><br>It will be worth while to keep in view the introductions to 
Chapters II (Al-Baqarah) and VIII (Al Anfal).</p>
<hr>
<p>1According to the early commentators, this earthquake will be a prelude to 
Resurrection. This will probably take place when the earth will begin to rotate 
in the reverse order, and the sun will rise in the west. In a lengthy Tradition 
reported by Ibn Jarir, 'Tabarani and Ibn Abi Hatim from Abu Hurairah, the Holy 
Prophet has stated that when the first Trumpet will be blown, there will be a 
general confusion; at the second all people will die and at the third they will 
be brought back to life and presented before Allah. At the first blowing of the 
Trumpet, the earth will begin to rock like a boat which is beaten about by huge 
waves, or like a hanging lamp which is moved from side to side by a strong wind.<br>
<br>This condition has been depicted in the Qur'an at several other places. For 
instance LVI: 6; LXIX: 13-14; LXXIII: 14, 17-18; LXXIX : 6-9 and XCIX: 1-3.<br>
<br>According to other commentators, this earthquake will occur when the dead 
will be brought back to life and presented before their Lord. Though this is 
supported by some Traditions, we prefer the first interpretation (in spite of 
the fact that the Tradition reported by Abu Hurairah is "weak") because that is 
supported by clear verses of the Qur'an.<br><br>2This is to show the intensity 
and honor of the earthquake. At that time there will be so much confusion acid 
terror that mothers will forsake their dear children at the very time they will 
be suckling them.<br><br>3It should be noted that it is not meant to depict here 
the condition of the Resurrection but to impress upon the people the dreadful 
torment of the Hour in order to admonish them to mend their ways. This is 
supported by the subsequent passage.<br><br>4They do not indulge in discussions 
or disputes about the Being or existence of Allah but about His rights and 
powers and His Revelations, as is evident from the succeeding passage. When the 
Holy Prophet tried to convince them of Tauhid and Resurrection, inevitably the 
dispute arose whether there is One Allah, the sole Sovereign or there were other 
partners as well in His Godhead and whether He has the power to bring about 
Resurrection, etc.<br><br>5"created you... sperm-drop": The first man Adam was 
created directly from clay and after him the process of procreation started by 
means of sperm-drop. This has been stated in XXXII: 7-8 as well. It may also 
mean that man is created from sperm-drop but his body is made of those elements 
which are all available in the earth.<br><br>6This refers to the different 
stages of development of the child in the womb of its mother. This description 
is based on observation and not on scientific research, and there was no need 
for it for the purpose for which reference to this has been made here.<br><br>
7That is, "In old age man is again reverted to the same condition in which he 
was in childhood. He loses his senses and knows little or nothing like a child".<br>
<br>8The Arabic Text may mean three things:<br><br>(1) Allah is telling the 
Truth and you are wrong in presuming that there is no possibility of 
life-after-death.<br><br>(2) Allah's existence is not merely a supposition but 
it is a Reality. He is not only the First Cause but has supreme authority, and 
is conducting every affair in the universe according to His Will, Knowledge and 
Wisdom.<br><br>(3) All His designs and works are based on Truth and are, 
therefore, serious, meaningful and full of wisdom.<br><br>9In this passage, 
different stages of the life of man, the effects of rain on the earth and the 
growth of vegetation have been cited as pointers to five realities:<br><br>(1) 
"Allah alone is the Truth".<br><br>(2) "He brings the dead to life".<br><br>(3) 
"He has power over everything".<br><br>(4) "The Day of Resurrection and the end 
of the world is inevitable".<br><br>(5) Most surely Allah will bring back to 
life all the people who have died", Let us now consider how these signs point to 
the above five realities:<br><br>(1) "Allah is the Truth": In order to prove 
this, let us first take the case of man. All the stages of his development are a 
clear proof that Allah has designed them with wisdom. He takes his birth from a 
sperm-drop which itself is produced in a wonderful manner. The food, which a man 
takes, turns into hair, flesh, bones and a part of it is turned into semen, 
which is potentially capable of producing millions of human beings. It is the 
Wise and True God Who decides which of these millions of seeds from the semen 
should be utilized to make a woman pregnant by mixing the seed with the 
egg-cell. This insignificant thing turns into a living child in nine months in 
the womb of the mother. If we consider the different stages of the child's birth 
we come to the inevitable conclusion that all these have been designed by the 
True, Ever Living Designer. For it is He Who decides whether it should be a male 
or a female, seeing or blind, etc. Then it is He Who decides how long a child is 
destined to live. All these things are a clear proof that Allah alone is the 
Truth.<br><br>(2) "He brings the dead to life": Even a little thinking on the 
right lines will convince every sensible and honest man that this process of 
bringing the dead to life is continuously going on before our eyes. Every human 
being has been created from a "dead" sperm-drop. Then he gets life from "dead 
things" like food containing dead matter like coal, iron, lime, salts, gases, 
which help make him a living human being. Then let us consider our surroundings. 
Seeds of different things which had been scattered here and there by the wind 
and birds, and the roots of different kinds of vegetation which lay rotten and 
dead in the soil, spring up to life as soon as there occurs a sprinkling of rain 
water. This process of the dead coming to life is observed during every rainy 
season year after year.<br><br>(3) "Allah has power over everything": There are 
people who believe that no doubt Allah created everything and is governing the 
universe, but He cannot do anything in the future in addition to or apart from 
this. This is because they do not observe the phenomena of His powers which have 
been and are appearing every moment. They do not realize that if man-His 
creation ran perform wonderful feats of science which could not even be dreamed 
of in the former ages, why should Allah alone be held as having only limited 
powers?<br><br>(4) "The Day of Resurrection is inevitable" and "Most surely 
Allah will bring back to life all the people who have died": These two are the 
rational corollaries of the preceding three premises. Allah is All-Powerful and 
therefore can bring about Resurrection at any moment He wills. He can also bring 
back to life all the dead people just as He brought to life human beings out of 
nothing in the first instance. As He is All-Wise, He has not created human 
beings without any object and purpose. He will judge their worldly lives in 
accordance with the object and purpose for which He created them. He will call 
them to account for everything He entrusted to them. This is very simple: even 
human beings ask one another to render an account of the property etc. they 
entrust to others. Likewise, Allah's wisdom requires to call every human being 
to account for the things entrusted to him. Then human nature also demands that 
there should be a differentiation between good and bad, and it expects the 
reward of good works and dreads the punishment of bad deeds. That is why the 
people have set up judicial courts. Thus man cannot imagine that the Creator 
will not call him to account for the things, powers and faculties, etc. which He 
has entrusted to him. Therefore common sense confirms that Allah will hold the 
Last Judgment so that every one should get his due reward and his due 
punishment.<br><br>10That is, they are so stiff-necked, proud, arrogant, 
obdurate and obstinate that they do not pay any heed to "Admonition".<br><br>
11"Knowledge": that personal information which is gained directly through 
observation and experience.<br><br>12"Guidance": that information which is 
gained .by reasoning or through another person who has knowledge.<br><br>
13“Illuminating Book:” Source of information gained from Divine Revelation.<br>
<br>14v. 3 mentioned those people who have themselves gone astray, but v. 9 
mentions those who have not only deviated from the Right Way themselves but are 
also bent upon misleading others from it.<br><br>15This type of man is a time 
server, who stands on the boundary line between Islam and kufr so that he may 
join the winning side whether it be Islam or kufr.<br><br>16As this type of man 
has a weak character and wavers between kufr and Islam he becomes the slave of 
his "self". He accepts Islam for the sake of self interest: he is faithful to it 
if all his wishes are fulfilled and he has a life of ease and comfort; he is 
well-pleased with his Allah and is "firm" in his faith. On the contrary, if his 
"faith" demands some sacrifice from him, or he is visited by some affliction, or 
encounters some hardship and loss in the way of Allah, or he does not have his 
way, he begins to waver about the Godhead of Allah and the Prophethood of the 
Messenger and becomes skeptical about everything of the "Faith". Then he is 
ready to bow down before any power from which he expects some benefit and 
security from loss.<br><br>17This is a great moral proposition that has been 
stated concisely. The fact is that the wavering man remains a loser in this 
world as well as in the Next World, and fares worse even than an unbeliever. The 
unbeliever applies himself exclusively to the benefits of this world and becomes 
more or less successful in his object because he is not handicapped by the fear 
of Allah, accountability of the Hereafter and restrictions of Divine Law. 
Likewise a true believer follows the way of Allah with fortitude and 
perseverance and may as well become successful in this world, but even if he 
loses it altogether, he is assured of success in the Next Y World. But the 
"wavering Muslim" becomes a loser both in this world and in the Next World 
because he is handicapped by doubt and indecision and cannot make his choice 
between the two worlds. As he cannot decide whether there is Allah and the 
Hereafter, he cannot apply himself exclusively to the worldly affairs with that 
single-mindedness which the unbeliever enjoys. And when he thinks of Allah and 
the Hereafter, the allurements of this world and the fear of the disadvantages 
here and the abhorrence of observing the Divine restrictions do not let him 
apply himself exclusively to the demands of the Hereafter. This conflict between 
"God worship" and "World worship" makes him a loser in this world as well as in 
the next. <br><br>18Vv. 12-13 clarify two things about the deities whom the 
mushriks invoke. Firstly, they can do a person neither any good nor any harm; 
nay, it is more probable that they do harm rather than good. For when the 
mushrik invokes other deities than Allah, he loses his faith forthwith. 
Secondly, the mushrik himself knows that there is no guarantee or probability of 
any good from his `god' who is utterly helpless and powerless. As regards the 
occasional grant of his request through his god, this is done by Allah merely to 
test his faith.<br><br>19That is, the one, who leads a person to the way of 
shirk is the worst guardian and the worst comrade, whether he be a human being 
or a satan.<br><br>20"Those who believed and did righteous deeds" are quite 
different from the wavering Muslims, for they have a firm belief in Allah, His 
Prophet and the Hereafter. Therefore they follow the way of Truth both in 
prosperity and in adversity.<br><br>21That is, "Allah's powers are unlimited: He 
may bestow anything on anyone He wills in this world or in the Hereafter or in 
both, and bar anything from anyone. None has the power to interfere with what He 
wills and does.”<br><br>22There is a great divergence of opinion about the exact 
meaning of this verse. Some of the interpretations are:<br><br>(1) One who 
presumes that Allah will not help him (Muhammad: Allah's peace be upon him), he 
should hang himself by a rope from the ceiling.<br><br>(2) One who presumes that 
Allah will not help him (Muhammad: Allah's peace be upon him), he should ascend 
the sky by a rope and try to stop Allah's help.<br><br>(3) One who presumes that 
Allah will not help him (Muhammad: Allah's peace be upon him), he should ascend 
the sky and stop the process of Revelations.<br><br>(4) One who presumes that 
Allah will not help him (Muhammad: Allah's peace be upon him), he should ascend 
the sky and stop his provisions.<br><br>(5) The one who presumes that Allah will 
not help him (the presumer himself), he should hang himself by a rope from the 
ceiling of his house.<br><br>(6) The one who presumes that Allah will not help 
him (the presumer himself), he should try to ascend the sky to seek help.<br>
<br>The first four interpretations are obviously irrelevant to the context, and 
the last two, though they might fit in with the context, do not explain the real 
meaning of the verse. If we consider this in the context, it becomes obvious 
that the one who presumes is "the one who serves Allah standing on the border" . 
This is to rebuke him, as if to say, "You may do whatever you can to change the 
decrees of Allah, but you will see that no device of yours can succeed, whether 
these decrees are favorable to your designs or unfavorable to them. " Obviously, 
"he should ascend the sky ...... cut a hole into it" has not been used in the 
literal but in the figurative sense.<br><br>23This means the "Muslims" of every 
age who believed in the Prophets of Allah and His Books up to the time of 
Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him): they included both the sincere 
Muslims and the wavering Muslims.<br><br>24See E.N. 72 of Chapter IV (An-Nisa).<br>
<br>25"Sabaeans": In ancient times two sects were known by this title:<br><br>
(1) The followers of Prophet John, who were found in upper Iraq in large numbers 
and practiced baptism.<br><br>(2) The worshipers of stars, who ascribed their 
creed to Prophets Shith and Idris (peace be upon them) and believed that the 
elements were governed by the planets and the planets by the angels. Their 
center was at Harran with branches spread all over Iraq. These people have been 
well known for their knowledge of philosophy and science and their achievements 
in medicine.<br><br>Probably here the first sect is referred to, because the 
second sect was not known by this name at the time the Qur'an was revealed.<br>
<br>26See E. N. 36 of Chapter V (AI-Ma'idah).<br><br>27That is, the 
fire-worshipers of Iran, who believed in two gods -one of light and the other of 
darknesses-and regarded themselves as the followers of Zoroaster. Their creed 
and morals were so corrupted by Mazdak that a brother could easily enter into 
matrimony with his sister.<br><br>28That is, "The mushriks of Arabia and of 
other countries, who had no special name like those mentioned above."<br><br>
29That is, "Allah will pass His judgment on the Day of Resurrection in regard to 
all the differences and disputes which take place between different people and 
different religions and will decide which of them was right and which was wrong. 
"<br><br>30See E.N. 25 Chapter XIII (Ar-Ra`d) and E.N. 41 of Chapter XVI (An-Nahl).<br>
<br>31That is, "Angels, stars, planets, etc. and all the creation that exists in 
other parts of the universe, whether it is rational and possesses freedom of 
will and choice like man, or irrational like animals, vegetation, solid matter, 
air and light.<br><br>32That is, "A large number of the people bow down before 
Allah not by compulsion but willingly. On the other hand, there are many other 
people who bow down before Him under compulsion along with everything else in 
the universe, but they deserve punishment because they refuse to obey Allah in 
those spheres of life in which they have the choice to obey or not to obey.<br>
<br>33That is, though the Final Judgment will be passed on the Day of 
Resurrection, a discerning eye can see even today those "who have already 
deserved the torment." For instance, the man who rejects the Message of the open 
book of Nature and the Message of the Prophets and adopts self-made false creeds 
and then disputes about them with the Believers, proves himself to be in 
manifest error in this world as well.<br><br>34In this verse "honor" and 
"disgrace" mean the acceptance of the Truth and its rejection. It is obvious 
that the one who does not see manifest realities is doomed to disgrace: for 
Allah lets him attain what he desires and works for; and when Allah does not 
bestow on anyone the honor of following the Truth, there is none else who can 
bestow it on him.<br><br>35Here it is obligatory to perform a sajdah 
(prostration), which is agreed upon by all Jurists. For further details please 
See E.N. 157 of Chapter VII (Al-A'raf).<br><br>36Here all the disputants about 
Allah have been divided into two main categories in spite of their large 
numbers:<br><br>(1) Those who believe in the Message of the Prophets and adopt 
the righteous way of life.<br><br>(2) Those who reject their Message and follow 
different ways of disbelief, though they may have countless differences and 
disputes among themselves.<br><br>37See v. 50 and E.N. 58 of Chapter XIV 
(Ibrahim) for explanation.<br><br>38This is to show that they will be honored 
like the kings and chiefs who used to wear ornaments of gold and jewelry in the 
period the Qur'an was revealed. <br><br>39"Pure Word": though it may imply every 
pure thing, here it refers to the basic articles of the Faith.<br><br>40As 
already stated in the Introduction, the portion of the Surah, which was sent 
down at Makkah, comes to an end here. Though its style is clearly that of the 
Makki Surahs and there is nothing to indicate that any part (or the whole) of it 
was revealed at al-Madinah, yet the words, "these are the two parties", have 
given rise to the misunderstanding that this verse was revealed at al-Madinah. 
Some commentators are of the opinion that the two parties referred to were the 
parties who met in the Battle of Badr, but there is nothing in the context to 
support this opinion. On the other hand, from the context in which these words 
occur, it becomes obvious that the two parties referred to were the "Believers 
and the disbelievers." For the conflict between Belief and disbelief has always 
been going on ever since the creation of man and will go on upto the Day of 
Resurrection.<br><br>Incidentally, this latter view helps prove that the Qur'an 
is a continuous whole and every part of it is closely connected with the other: 
whereas the comments mentioned earlier would imply that there is no continuous 
theme in the Qur'an but different parts of it have been put together without 
rhyme or reason.<br><br>41"Those who disbelieved" were the people who rejected 
the Message of the Holy Prophet. The subsequent theme clearly shows that they 
were the disbelievers of Makkah.<br><br>42That is, "They debarred the Holy 
Prophet and his followers from performing Hajj and 'Umrah".<br><br>43That is, 
"This is not exclusively the property of any person or family or clan but is 
meant for all mankind alike. Therefore bone has any right to debar others from 
it."<br><br>In this connection, two questions have arisen among the Jurists of 
Islam:<br><br>(1) What is meant by the "Sacred Mosque" ? Does it mean the mosque 
itself or includes the whole "Inviolable Place" of Makkah?<br><br>(2) What is 
meant by "equal rights" of its dwellers and the outsiders ?<br><br>According to 
some jurists it means the "Sacred Mosque" itself and not the whole of Inviolable 
Makkah. They base this opinion on the apparent wording of the Qur'an, and say 
that by "equal rights" is meant equal rights only in regard to worship in it. 
They cite a Tradition of the Holy Prophet to support their opinion. He said: "O 
children of 'Abd Manaf, those of you who will have authority over the affairs of 
the people, should not stop anybody from moving round the Ka'bah or froth 
offering prayers in it at any time of the day or night."<br><br>Imam Shafi'i and 
others who support this view are of the opinion that it is wrong to conclude 
from this verse that the rights of the dwellers and the outsiders are equal in 
every respect, but they are equal only in regard to the right of worship and in 
nothing else, for the people of Makkah owned the lands and the houses of Makkah 
before Islam and also after it. So much so that during the time of Caliph Umar, 
the house of Safwan bin Umayyah was actually purchased from him for the purpose 
of making a prison in Makkah.<br><br>The others who hold that the "Sacred 
Mosque" refers to the whole of the "Inviolable Place" of Makkah derive their 
authority from verses 196 and 217 of Chapter II (Al-Baqarah). They argue that 
Hajj is not performed only in the Ka'bah (the Sacred Mosque), but the pilgrim 
has to visit Mina, Muzdalifah, `Arafat, etc. for the performance of Hajj rites. 
Thus, they hold that equality is not merely in regard to worship in the "Sacred 
Mosque", but in regard to all other rights in Makkah. As this place has been 
appointed for Hajj by Allah for all alike, none has any right of ownership in 
it. Anyone can stay anywhere he likes and node can prohibit him from doing so. 
They cite many Traditions in support of their opinion:<br><br>(1) Abdullah bin 
`Umar reports that the Holy Prophet said: "Makkah is the place where travelers 
have to stay: therefore its lands cannot be sold nor can anyone charge rent for 
its houses."<br><br>(2) According to Ibrahim Nakha`i, the Holy Prophet said: "Makkah 
has been made an "Inviolable Place" by Allah: therefore selling its land and 
charging of rent for its houses is unlawful". Mujahid has also reported a 
tradition almost in similar words.<br><br>(3) Alqamah says, "During the time of 
the Holy Prophet, and of the first three Caliphs, the lands of Makkah were 
regarded as common property and one could live there or allow others to live 
therein."<br><br>(4) `Abdullah bin `Umar says, "Caliph `Umar had ordered that no 
resident of Makkah should close the door of his house during the Hajj season." 
According to Mujahid; Caliph `Umar had ordered that the people of Makkah should 
not put doors to enclose their courtyards but keep them open so that anyone who 
liked might come in and stay there. The same has been related by `Ata' with the 
addition that Suhail bin `Amr was the only exception to this rule, who was 
allowed to put a door in his courtyard in order to safeguard his camels in 
connection with his trade.<br><br>(5) `Abdullah bin `Umar also says that the one 
who receives rent for his house in Makkah fills his belly with fire.<br><br>(6) 
`Abdullah bin `Abbas says that Allah has made the whole of Makkah the "Sacred 
Mosque" where all have equal rights, Therefore the people of Makkah have no 
right to charge rent.<br><br>(7) `Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz sent an order to the 
governor of Makkah to this effect: "No rent should be charged for the houses of 
Makkah because it is unlawful".<br><br>On the basis of the above traditions, 
quite a few of the followers of the Companions and also, Imams Malik, Abu 
Hanifah, Sufyan Thauri, Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ishaq bin Rahawayah from among the 
Jurists, are of the opinion that it is unlawful to sell a piece of land and to 
charge rent, at least during the Hajj season, in Makkah. However, the majority 
of the Jurists are of the opinion that people can own houses in Makkah and can 
sell them as buildings but not as land. In my opinion, this last view seems to 
be the right one because it conforms with the Qur'an and the Sunnah and the 
practice of the rightly-guided Caliphs. It is obvious that Allah has not made 
Hajj obligatory for the Muslims of the whole world in order to provide a means 
of income for the people of Makkah. As Allah Has set apart the "Inviolable 
Place" for the benefit of all the Believers,. that land is not the property of 
anyone and every pilgrim has the right to stay anywhere he can find room for 
himself.<br><br>44It does not imply any specific act, but means every act that 
deviates from righteousness and falls under the definition of iniquity. Though 
all such acts are sins at all times and places; their commission in the 
"Inviolable Place" makes them all the more heinous; so much so that the 
commentators are of the opinion that even taking of an unnecessary oath brings 
it under the same category.<br><br>Besides common sins, there are certain other 
things whose commission in the " Inviolable Place" brings them under the same 
category. For instance:<br><br>(l) It is prohibited to take legal action even 
against a murderer, etc. who takes shelter within the "Inviolable Place": so 
much so that he cannot be arrested as long as he retrains therein. This sanctity 
of the "Inviolable Place" is being observed since the time of Prophet Abraham. 
The Qur'an says, "Whoso even enters it, he becomes safe and secure . . ." (III: 
97).<br><br>(2) The consensus of opinion is that there can be no retribution 
within the "Inviolable Place" for the crimes committed outside it. Hadrat `Umar, 
`Abdullah bin `Umar and `Abdullah bin `Abbas declared, "We will not take any 
action in it even against the murderer of our fathers."<br><br>(3) It is 
unlawful to wage war or shed blood within it. On the second day of the conquest 
of Makkah, the Holy Prophet declared, "O people, Allah has trade Makkah a 
Sanctuary since the very creation of this world, and it will remain so by 
Allah's ordinance up to the Day of Resurrection; therefore, it is not lawful for 
any man, who believes in Allah and the Day of Resurrection, to shed blood here". 
Then he added, "Suppose a man legalizes bloodshed here on the basis of the 
precedent that I waged war here, tell him, 'Allah made it lawful for His 
Messenger and not for you'. It was made lawful for me for a short interval of 
the day. Then it was again made "Inviolable" as before".<br><br>(4) It is 
unlawful to cut naturally growing trees or uproot the grass which has grown 
there. It is also prohibited to hunt birds and animals within the boundary or to 
drive them out from the "Inviolable Place" for hunting. It is, however, lawful 
to kill a serpent, a scorpion and other harmful animals and to uproot dry grass 
and "Izkhir" which is a kind of grass.<br><br>(5) It is prohibited to pick up 
anything that has fallen to the ground. In a Tradition, reported by Abu Dawud, 
the Holy Prophet prohibited people to pick up, anything belonging to a pilgrim 
that had fallen to the ground.<br><br>(6) It is unlawful for a pilgrim who comes 
with the intention of performing Hajj or 'Umrah" to enter therein without Ihram. 
However, there is a divergence of opinion in regard to the entry of others than 
the pilgrims without Ihram. According to 'Abdullah bin `Abbas no one is allowed 
to enter therein without Ihram in any case, and this has been supported by a 
saying each of Imam Ahmad and Imam Shafi`i. According to other sayings of Imams 
Ahmad and Shafi`i, those people who have to visit the' "Inviolable Place" 
frequently in connection with trade and business, are excepted. Imam Abu Hanifah, 
however, holds the view that the person who lives within the limits of the 
appointed "Miqats" can visit Makkah without Ihram but the outsiders cannot enter 
it without Ihram.<br><br>45Some commentators opine that the address to Prophet 
Abraham ends with v. 26 and say that the Command contained in v. 27 was 
addressed to the Holy Prophet; but this opinion does not fit in with the 
context. For it is obvious that this Command also was addressed to Prophet 
Abraham when he had built the Ka`bah. Moreover, the command implies that the 
House of Allah had been built for the worship of One Allah and there was general 
permission from the very first day for all worshipers to visit it for performing 
Hajj.<br><br>46The expression "lean camels" has been deliberately used to depict 
the picture of the camels of pilgrims coming from far-off places to perform 
Hajj. <br><br>47In my opinion the address to Prophet Abraham comes to an end 
with v. 27 and vv. 28-29 have been added to emphasize and give further 
instructions for the performance of Hajj. We have based this opinion on the use 
of the epithet "Ancient House of the Ka`bah". It could not have been used at the 
time when Prophet Abraham built it. (For further details about the construction 
of the Ka`bah see II: 125-129, III: 96, 97 and XIV: 35-41).<br><br>48"The 
benefits" include both religious and worldly benefits. It was due mainly to the 
Ka`bah that during the period of 2500 years between the times of Prophet Abraham 
and the Holy Prophet, the Arabs, in spite of their tribal life, remained 
attached to one central place and continued to visit it from all parts of Arabia 
for performing Hajj year after year. This in turn preserved their language, 
their culture and their Arab identity. Then during the course of the year they 
were afforded at least four months of perfect peace when anybody and everybody 
could safely travel alone or in trade caravans; thus the ritual of Hajj was 
directly beneficial to economic life of the country as well. For details see 
III: 97 and E.N's 80, 81 thereof, and V: 97 and E.N. 113 thereof.<br><br>49"The 
cattle" here imply the camel, cow, sheep and goat as has been clearly mentioned 
in VI:142-144.". . . they should mention the name of Allah over the cattle" 
implies that they should slaughter the cattle for Allah's. sake and in His name, 
as is clear from the subsequent sentences. Allah's name should be recited at the 
time the cattle are slaughtered to show that the Muslims are to slaughter and 
sacrifice animals in Allah's name alone so as to distinguish them from the 
disbelievers who slaughtered animals without mentioning Allah's name or by 
mentioning other names than that of Allah.<br><br>As regards "the known 
appointed days", there is a difference of opinion as to their exact identity. 
Some of the opinions as to what the "appointed days" mean are:<br><br>(1) The 
first ten days of Zil-Hajj. This view is supported by Ibn `Abbas, Hasan Basri, 
Ibrahim Nakha`i, Qatadah and several other Companions and their followers. Imams 
Abu Hanifah, Shafi`i and Ahmad bin Hanbal have also favored this view.<br><br>
(2) The tenth of Zil-Hajj and the three days following it. This view is 
supported by Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Ibrahim Nakha`i, Hasan and `Ata'. Imams 
Shafi`i and Ahmad are also reported to have favored this in a saying each.<br>
<br>(3) The tenth day of Zil-Hajj and the two following days. This view has been 
supported by Hadrat `Umar, `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Anas bin Malik, Abu 
Hurairah, Said bin Musayyab and Said bin Jubair. Sufyan Thauri, Imam Malik, Imam 
Abu Yusuf and Imam Muhammad from among the Jurists have also adopted it, and the 
Hanafites and the Malikites are also generally agreed on this.<br><br>50The 
imperative mood of the verb has given rise to the misunderstanding that it is 
obligatory to eat their flesh and also to give of it to the needy people, Imams 
Shafi`i and Malik opine that it is good to eat of it and it is obligatory to 
give of it to others. According to Imam Abu Hanifah, both these things are 
permitted but are not obligatory. It is good to eat of it, for the people in the 
days of ignorance considered it unlawful to eat sacrificial meat of their own 
animals, and it is good to give of it to the poor by way of help. Ibn Jarir has 
cited instances from Hasan Basri, `Ata', Mujahid and Ibrahim Nakha`i to prove 
that the imperative mood dces not always imply a command, as for example in V: 2 
and LXII: 10. Thus, ".... give of it to the indigent" does not mean that the 
flesh cannot be given to a rich person for the Companions of the Holy Prophet 
used to give of it to their friends, neighbors, relatives whether they were rich 
or poor. According to Ibn `Umar, one-third of the flesh may be consumed at home, 
one-third may be given to the neighbors and the remaining one-third distributed 
among the needy.<br><br>51It means that after performing the essential Hajj 
rites, one should put off Ihram, have a shave, bath, etc. for one is free from 
the restrictions of Ihram after Hajj. However, one is not allowed to have sexual 
relations with his wife till one has performed the Tawaf of Ziyarah or Ifadah.
<br><br>52That is, the vow one has made for that occasion.<br><br>53The Arabic 
word `Atiq, which has been used for the Ka`bah, is very meaningful for it 
implies:<br><br>(1) ancient,<br><br>(2) free from the sovereignty and ownership 
of anyone,<br><br>(3) honored and revered.<br><br>I am of the opinion that here 
the word Tawaf refers to the circumambulation performed on the tenth day of Zil-Hajj 
after setting aside Ihram, as the last ritual of Hajj, and is called Tawaf of 
Ifadah or Ziyarah (Visit).<br><br>54Though the "command" is of a general nature, 
here it refers particularly to the prohibitions which are connected with the 
"Sacred Mosque", Hajj, 'Umrah and Makkah. Incidentally, there is a subtle hint 
in it to the Quraish; who had driven out the Muslims from Makkah and debarred 
them from Hajj and violated the sanctity of the "Ancient House" by associating 
indecent, filthy, and ungodly rites with Hajj and the House in contradiction to 
the ways of Abraham.<br><br>55"And the cattle have been made lawful for you 
...." has been cited here for two objects:<br><br>(1) It is to refute the custom 
of the Quraish under which certain cattle-bahirah. saibah, wasilah and ham-were 
considered unlawful. They are being told that these are also lawful like other 
cattle.<br><br>(2) It is not unlawful as was held by the Quraish to eat the 
flesh of the cattle even in the state of "Ihram". <br><br>56This refers to VI: 
145 and XVI: 11S in which Allah has forbidden the Muslims to eat what dies of 
itself, blood, flesh of swine or what has been slaughtered in any name other 
than Allah's.<br><br>57That is, "Refrain from and guard against the worship of 
idols just as you avoid filthy and dirty things"<br><br>58Though the expression 
"false things" is general and implies lies, false evidence, calumny, etc., here 
it particularly refers to those false creeds, rites, and rituals and 
superstitious things on which kufr and shirk have been founded. It is obvious 
that there is no greater lie than associating others with Allah in His Being, 
Attributes, Powers and Rights. It was a falsehood to make bahirah, etc. 
unlawful. . See also XVI :116.<br><br>To take a false oath and give a false 
evidence also come under this Commandment. A Tradition from the Holy Prophet 
says:<br><br>"A false evidence is equal to shirk with Allah." That is why 
according to the Islamic Law, a false witness should be punished and disgraced. 
Imams Abu Yusuf and Muhammad have expressed the opinion that a person who brings 
a false witness in the court should be publicly exposed and sentenced to a long 
imprisonment. This was the actual practice in the time of Hadrat `Umar. 
According to Makhul, he said:<br><br>"Such a person should be whipped, his head 
shaved and face blackened and he should be sentenced to a long imprisonment."<br>
<br>'Abdullah bin `Amir has reported from his father that a person's false 
evidence was established in Hadrat `Umar's court, whereupon the Caliph kept him 
exposed to public for a day, saying that he was so and so and a false witness so 
that people might recognize him, and then he imprisoned him. These days this can 
be done by publishing the culprit's name in the newspapers, etc. <br><br>59In 
this parable "heaven" means the original human nature. Man by nature is the 
servant of none else but Allah and inherently accepts the Doctrine of Tauhid. 
That is why the one who follows the guidance of the Prophets becomes firm in 
these dictates of his nature and soars higher and higher. On the other hand, the 
one who rejects Allah or associates a partner with Him falls down from the "heaven"of 
his nature. Then he either becomes a victim of satans and evil leaders like the 
birds of the parable, which snatch away the fallen man, or he becomes a slave of 
his lusts, passions, whims, etc., which have been likened to the wind in the 
parable. They lower him down from one wrong position to the other till he falls 
into the deepest abyss of degradation.<br><br>60"Symbols of God worship": the 
performance of Salat, Hajj, Fasting, etc., or things like a Mosque or 
sacrificial offerings, etc. (See V: 2 and E.N.'s 5-7 thereof).<br><br>61That is, 
the observance of the sanctity of the "Symbols" by a man is a proof that there 
is piety in his heart. On the other hand, the man who violates their sanctity 
proves himself to be void of piety and fear of God. It shows that he either does 
not believe at all in Allah or adopts a rebellious attitude against Him.<br><br>
62This is to remove the misunderstanding about getting any benefit from the 
animals dedicated for sacrifice as they were also included in the "Symbols of 
Allah. This was necessitated because the Arabs believed that it was unlawful to 
get any benefit from them. One could neither ride on them nor carry any load on 
them nor consume their milk, after they had been dedicated for sacrifice during 
Hajj. In this verse that misunderstanding has been removed. Hadrat Abu Hurairah 
and Anas have reported that the Holy Prophet saw a man walking in a miserable 
condition on foot leading his camel by the nose-string. When the Holy Prophet 
asked him to ride on it, he replied that it was his sacrificial offering. The 
Holy Prophet again urged him to ride on his camel.<br><br>There is a divergence 
of opinion in regard to the interpretation of "an appointed time". Some 
commentators, particularly Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Mujahid, Dahhak and `Ata' are of 
the view that it refers to the time of the dedication of the animals for 
sacrifice. Obviously this is not the correct view, because in that case the 
permission to get benefit from them becomes meaningless. There are other 
commentators including `Urwah bin Zubair and `Ala' bin Abi Rabah, who are of the 
view that "appointed time" means the time of sacrifice and one can get benefit 
from them up till then. One may ride on them, drink their milk, take their young 
ones for use and shear their hair, wool, etc. Imam Shaf`i has adopted this view. 
The Hanafites are of the opinion that one can get benefit from them, if need be, 
though it is preferable not to do so. <br><br>63It does not mean that the 
sacrifice is to be made in the precincts of the "Ancient House" of the Ka`ah. 
The Qur'an uses the "House of Allah" or Masjid-i-Haram for the whole of the 
"Inviolable Place" of Makkah and not for that particular building. (V: 95)<br>
<br>64This verse implies two things:<br><br>(1) Sacrifice has been an essential 
part of the worship of One Allah in all the revealed religions. In order to 
inculcate Tauhid, Allah prohibited sacrifice for anyone other than Himself. This 
was in keeping with the other prohibitions which were made for others than 
Allah. For instance, "prostration" before anyone other than Allah, making vows 
for others than Allah, visiting holy places others than those prescribed by 
Allah, fasting in the name of others than of Alla, etc., were all prohibited.<br>
<br>(2) The other thing which has been common in all the revealed religions was 
the object of the sacrifice in the name of Allah though its details have been 
different in different religions, times and countries. <br><br>65The Arabic word 
`mukhbitin' has no equivalent in English. It includes those who (1) give up 
pride, arrogance and adopt humility before Allah, (2) surrender themselves to 
His service and slavery, and (3) accept His decrees sincerely. <br><br>66It 
means that righteous people spend their lawful provisions in the Way of Allah to 
meet their own and their dependents' lawful needs, to help their relatives, 
neighbors and other needy people, on public works and propagation of the Word of 
Allah. It does not include expenditure in unlawful ways for unlawful purposes. 
The Qur'anic term lnfaq implies neither over-spending nor being miserly and 
stingy, but spending one's wealth on oneself and others according to one's means 
and status in society.<br><br>67Seven persons can become partners in the 
sacrifice of one camel and likewise in the sacrifice of one cow and the like, as 
enjoined by the Holy Prophet in a Tradition reported by Jabir bin `Abdullah in 
the Collection of Hadith by Muslim.<br><br>68That is, "You should sacrifice 
animals because you get many benefits front them to show your gratitude to 
Allah, the Giver, and also to acknowledge His Supremacy and Sovereignty".<br>
<br>69It should be noted that a camel is sacrificed while it is standing. This 
was enjoined by the Holy Prophet and is supported by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, I)ahhak, 
etc. Muslim and Bukhar have reported a Tradition from Hadrat Ibn Umar, who saw a 
man slaughtering his camel in the sitting position. He said to him, "Tie one 
foot of your camel and make it stand, because that is the way of Abu Qasim 
(peace be upon him)". According to a tradition reported by Hadrat Jabir bin 
'Abdullah, in Abu Dawud, the Holy Prophet and his Companions would tie a left 
foot of the camel and would make it stand on three feet; then they would 
slaughter it. The same is implied by the subsequent sentence: " ...and after 
their backs lie still on the ground .......", i.e. when they fall down to the 
ground after enough of their blood has run out. <br><br>70"Mention the name of 
Allah over them" implies that animals should be slaughtered by pronouncing the 
name of Allah over them, because without that their flesh would be unlawful to 
eat. This shows that in the Islamic Law there is no conception of slaughtering 
an animal without pronouncing the name of Allah over it. According to 
Traditions, there are different wordings for pronouncing the name of Allah over 
the animals at the time of their slaughter. Some of these are:<br><br>(I) 
Bismillahi Allahu Akbar; Allahumma minks wa laka: "In the name of Allah, Allah 
is most Great! O Allah, this is Thine and is presented to Thee".<br><br>(2) 
Allahu Akbar- La ilaha ill-Allahu; Allahumma minks wa laka: "Allah is most 
Great: There is no god but Allah: O Allah, this is Thine and is presented to 
Thee" .<br><br>(3) Inni wajjahtu wajhiya lillazi fatar-as-sama wati wal-arda, 
hanif-an-wa ma ana min-al-mushrikin. Inns Salati wa nusuki wa mahyaya wa mamati 
lillahi Rabb-il- 'alamin. La sharika lahu wa bi-zalika umirtu wa ana min-al-Muslimin. 
A llahumma minks wa laka. "I have turned my face sincerely towards the Being Who 
created the heavens and the earth, and I am not from among the idolatrous 
people. My Salat and my rites of worship and my life and my death are all for 
Allah, the Lord of the universe, Who has no partner with Him. This is what I 
have been enjoined and I am the first to surrender to Him. O Allah! This is 
Thine, and is presented to Thee."<br><br>71".......lie still on the 
ground......." means till they die completely, for the Holy Prophet prohibited 
to cut off a piece of flesh, if there is still any sign of life in the 
slaughtered animal; if this is done, the piece of flesh would be unlawful.<br>
<br>72This is another reason why animals should be sacrificed: "They should be 
sacrificed as a mark of gratitude to Allah Who has subjected them to you".<br>
<br>73This prescribes a very important condition for the sacrifice made in the 
worship of Allah. A sacrifice is acceptable to Allah only if it is accompanied 
by piety and sincerity. Though sacrifice is a Symbol of Allah, yet it has been 
made plain that it is accepted only if it is accompanied by piety, saying, 
"Neither their flesh reaches Allah nor their blood, but it is your piety ...." 
This was also meant to condemn the ritual of the days of ignorance, when the 
Arabs took the flesh to the Ka'bah and smeared its walls with the blood of the 
sacrificed animal. <br><br>74".... you should glorify Allah" at the time of 
sacrifice verbally also in order to acknowledge that the animals really belong 
to Allah and to no one else. One of the sentences uttered at the time of 
sacrifice is Allahumma minka wa laka (O Allah, this animal is Thine and is 
presented to Thee).<br><br>It should be noted well that the command of sacrifice 
as contained in verses 36 and 37 is not for the pilgrims alone and that the 
performance of sacrifice is not confined to Makkah on the occasion of Hajj. It 
is a general command for all those Muslims who are well off. They have been 
enjoined to be grateful to Allah because He has subjected these animals for the 
good of all human beings. Therefore they are required to sacrifice the animals 
during these days so that they may spiritually join those who go to Makkah to 
perform Hajj.<br><br>There are many authentic Traditions to the effect that the 
Holy Prophet made sacrifice on this occasion, while he was personally at al-Madinah:<br>
<br>(1) "The one who does not perform sacrifice even though he can should not 
join us in the `Id Prayer". (Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Majah).<br><br>(2) According to a 
Tradition reported by Ibn 'Umar, the Holy Prophet dwelt at al-Madinah for ten 
years and performed sacrifice every year. (Tirmizi).<br><br>(3) According to 
Hadrat Anas, the Holy Prophet said:<br><br>"The one who sacrificed an animal 
before the 'Id Prayer, should offer another sacrifice; but the one who 
sacrificed his animal after the 'Id Prayer, did the right thing and followed the 
way of the Muslims". (Bukhari)<br><br>It this connection, it is note-worthy that 
no `Id Prayer is held on the tenth of Zil-Hajj in Makkah: therefore the 
injunction was meant for all Muslims and not only for those performing Hajj at 
Makkah.<br><br>Thus, it is clear that the sacrifice on the occasion of 'Id which 
is observed in the whole Muslim world is a Sunnah of the Holy Prophet and has 
been enjoined by him. The only dispute is whether it is obligatory in nature or 
only a Sunnah. Ibrahim Nakha'i, Imams Abu Hanifah, Malik, Muhammad and, 
according to a Tradition, Imam Abu Yusuf too, are of the opinion that it is 
Obligatory in nature. On the other hand, Imams Shafi`i and Ahmad bin Hanbal 
regard it only as a Sunnah of the Muslims, and Sufyan Thauri has also agreed 
with them, saying that there will be no harm if a person does not offer a 
sacrifice. It is, however, an irony that some of the "learned" Muslims of our 
time, who follow neither the Qur'an nor the Sunnah, and are only guided by 
personal whims, have declared that if there is a consensus of opinion of the 
Muslims, they can give up the practice of sacrifice on the occasion of Eid.<br>
<br>75From here the address for the first time prepares the Muslims for Jihad. 
In order to understand this, we should keep in view the preceding portion (vv. 
19-24) in which the ideological conflict between the two parties (Believers and 
disbelievers) and the result thereof have been described. This naturally serves 
as a prelude to the armed conflict between the two parties. That is why in vv. 
26-37 the immediate causes which necessitated war have been stated to serve as 
an introduction and justification for war with the disbelievers of Makkah.<br>
<br>After the migration to al-Madinah, when the first Hajj season approached, it 
naturally brought along with it anguish and anger both for the Muhajirs and the 
Ansar, who had been debarred froth visiting Makkah and performing Hajj, That is 
why, in this passage (vv. ,26-37) the rituals and the objects of Hajj have been 
described to bring home to the disbelievers that they had no right to debar 
anyone from Hajj. On the other hand, the Muslims are being prepared to fight not 
with the intention of wreaking vengeance but for the sake of reform. At the same 
time sacrifice on the occasion of Hajj has been prescribed as a permanent rite 
to enable them (and the Muslims of the whole world) to commemorate Hajj and the 
rites connected with it, so that they might refrain from wreaking vengeance on 
the people of Makkah for the persecution to which they had been subjected. They 
have, therefore, been enjoined to fight to bring about better conditions and not 
to take. revenge on their persecutors.<br><br>76The Arabic word mudafi at 
implies two things:<br><br>(1) to fight with the enemy to ward off his 
aggressive attack;<br><br>(2) to fight with the enemy not just once but whenever 
the need arises. Allah has assured the Believers that He will defend them 
against the enemy every tithe there is a conflict between Islam and kufr. This 
is to encourage the Believers that they will not be left alone in their defence, 
but Allah Himself will be a party with them and will help them to frustrate the 
cunning designs of the enemy and to ward off their attacks. Indeed this verse is 
a great encouragement for the Believers, for it imbues their hearts with spirit 
and strength which nothing else can. <br><br>77Allah becomes a party with the 
Believers because they are justified in waging war against the disbelievers who 
are treacherous and ungrateful to Allah in spite of His marry blessings and 
favors to them.<br><br>78This (v. 39) is the first verse of the Qur'an in which 
permission to tight was given in the month of Zil-Hajj in the first year after 
Hijrah according to our research. Then the command to fight was given in vv. 
190, 191, 193, 216 and 244 of Chapter II (Al-Baqarah) in Rajab or Sha`ban of 
A.H. 2.<br><br>79".....and Allah is certainly able to help them": this assurance 
was urgently needed by the persecuted Muslims whose fighting strength at that 
time was very meager, not even a thousand including all the migrants and the 
Muslims of al-Madinah. On the other hand, the fighting strength of the Quraish 
by themselves was much greater. Besides, they had all the other mushrik clans of 
Arabia at their back and were joined later by the Jews as well. Therefore, this 
assurance was most opportune and the challenge to the disbelievers was very 
significant, for it meant to say that they were not fighting against a small 
number of the Muslims but against Allah. Therefore, "You are. welcome to fight 
if you dare".<br><br>80The mention of their expulsion from their homes in v. 40 
is a clear proof that this portion of Surah al-Hajj was revealed at al-Madinah.<br>
<br>81In order to have an idea of the severe persecution of the Muslims, a few 
instances of this are cited.<br><br>(1) Hadrat Suhaib Rumi was deprived of 
everything, when he was about to migrate to al-Madinah. When he reached there, 
he had nothing with him except the clothes he was wearing. Though he had earned 
all that through his own labors he was deprived of everything by the 
disbelievers of Makkah.<br><br>(2) When Hadrat Abu Salmah was about to leave 
Makkah with his wife and a suckling child, his in-laws forcibly separated his 
wife from him, and then the people of his own family tore away the child from 
them. Thus the poor woman had to pass one whole year in sorrow and grief. After 
a year, she secured the child somehow and journeyed from Makkah to al-Madinah 
with it all alone on a dangerous route.<br><br>(3) `Ayyash bin Rabi`ah was a 
half brother of Abu Jahl: When he migrated to al Madinah, he was followed by Abu 
Jahl and another brother of his, and they told him the lie: "Your mother has 
taken the oath that she will not move from the sun to the shade nor comb her 
hair until she should see you (`Ayyash) You should therefore go back with us to 
Makkah,' show her your face and then come back". He was taken in by this trick. 
When they were journeying back the two brothers made him a prisoner, took him to 
Makkah with his hands and feet tied, and proclaimed, "O people of Makkah, this 
is how these lads should be treated and set right". He remained in that state 
for a long time and was at last rescued by a brave Muslim. <br><br>82Saumah (pl. 
Swami), Biyah and Salawat in the original Text are the places of worship of the 
monks who have left the world, the Christians and the Jews respectively. Salawat 
was Salauta in Aramaic, which might be the origin of the English words salute 
and salutation.<br><br>83In this sentence, a Divine principle has been stated:<br>
<br>"Allah does not let a group of people or a community have authority for 
ever. Every now and then He repels one group by means of another".<br><br>If 
this had not been the case, the permanent dominator would have created chaos not 
only in the political and economic spheres, but would have encroached upon the 
places of worship as well. This "principle" has also been stated in v. 251 of 
Chapter II (Al-Baqarah).<br><br>84Those "who help Allah" are the people who 
invite mankind to Tauhid and exert their utmost to establish the "True Faith" 
and righteousness. For further explanation see E.N. 50 of Chapter III 
(AI-i-`Imran).<br><br>85".......if We give them power ...... evil": In this one 
sentence, the real aim of the Islamic State and the characteristics of those who 
conduct its affairs have been stated concisely but comprehensively. Those who 
help Allah and deserve His succor behave righteously, establish Salat, make 
arrangements for the collection of Zakat and use their power and authority to 
propagate good and eradicate evil.<br><br>86That is, "It is Allah Who decides 
whom to give power in the land and when" . This is meant to remove the 
misunderstanding of the proud and arrogant people who think that the destiny of 
the land and its dwellers is in their hands, and there is none to depose them 
from power. But Allah dethrones the most haughty ruler in supernatural ways and 
gives power to the most humble in order to show that He is All-Powerful, 
All-Mighty. "<br><br>87"The disbelievers of Makkah."<br><br>88The instances of 
some peoples who rejected their Prophets have been cited to impress that they 
were given respite to reform themselves before they were punished. Therefore, "O 
people of Makkah, you should not be deluded by the delay in your punishment. 
When the term of respite comes to an end, you shall also be punished like the 
former people, if you do not mend your ways in the meantime".<br><br>89The 
Arabic word Nakir is very comprehensive and implies two meanings:<br><br>(1) 
Displeasure at the evil conduct of the other, and<br><br>(2) a terrible 
punishment which disfigures the culprit so badly that he cannot even be 
recognized. The sentence therefore will mean: "Just see when I seized them for 
this evil conduct, how terrible was My chastisement". <br><br>90In Arabic a 
"well" is synonymous with a "habitation". Thus "many a well .... useless" means 
"many a habitation has been destroyed".<br><br>91The words ".... the hearts .... 
blind" have been used in the metaphorical and not in the literal sense. Since 
the heart is regarded as the center of emotions, feelings and of mental and 
moral qualities, these words have been used to imply that their obduracy has 
inhibited them from feeling and acting rationally.<br><br>92This refers to the 
oft-repeated challenge by the disbelievers: "Well, if you are a true prophet, 
why does not that chastisement come with which you have been threatening us, for 
we have been rejecting your claim of being a true Prophet of Allah?"<br><br>
93That is, "The decisions of Allah do not follow your time and calendar, nor do 
the consequences of your wrong attitudes appear immediately after the deeds". 
Therefore it will be very foolish for the part of a people to argue that the 
threat of punishment was empty just because a decade or a century had passed 
since they had adopted a wicked attitude and conduct with impurity.<br><br>
94That is, "I am merely a warner and not the maker of your destinies. It is 
Allah Who passes judgment and decides about the punishment."<br><br>95"The 
Believers shall have forgiveness" means that Allah will overlook their faults, 
weaknesses, and acts of omission and commission. They will have "honorable 
provisions" means that they will have excellent supplies which will be given to 
them in an honorable way.<br><br>96For the distinction between Nabi and Rasul, 
refer to E. N. 30 of Chapter XIX (Maryam).<br><br>97The Arabic word tamanna has 
two meanings: "desire" and "to recite" something.<br><br>98If the first meaning 
is taken, it will imply: "Satan tried to prevent the fulfillment of his desire." 
If the second meaning is taken, it will imply: "When the Prophet recited the 
Revelations, Satan created different sorts of doubts about its truth and 
meanings in the minds of the people."<br><br>99If the first meaning is adopted, 
it will imply: "Allah fulfills the Prophet's desire and makes his Mission 
successful in spite of the obstacles of Satan and confirms the truth of His 
Revelations by fulfilling His promises to the Prophet". In case of the second 
meaning, it will imply: "Allah eradicates all the doubts and objections inspired 
by Satan in the hearts of the people and clarifies the confusion created about 
any verse of the Qur'an in subsequent Revelations".<br><br>100"Allah is 
All-Knowing" and has full knowledge of the mischief worked by Satan and of its 
effects, and being ;'All-Wise", He counteracts every mischief of Satan.<br><br>
101That is, "Allah lets Satan work such mischiefs to put to the test both the 
righteous and the wicked people". The people with a perverted mentality deduce 
wrong conclusions from these and deviate from the Right Way, while those, who 
think on the right lines, realize that all these things are the mischiefs of 
Satan and that the Message of the Prophet is based on the Truth. They conclude 
that the very fact that Satan has been so much agitated and become active 
against it is a clear proof of its being the Truth. It is very important to 
understand the real significance of this passage (vv. 52-54) for this has given 
rise to a grave misunderstanding .<br><br>If we consider it in the context in 
which it occurs, it becomes obvious that it was sent down to refute the wrong 
appraisal of the casual observers that the Holy Prophet had "failed" to achieve 
his desired object. This was because he had striven for thirteen long years to 
persuade his people to accept his Message but the apparent result was that he 
had not only failed in this, but he and the small band of his followers had been 
forced to leave their homes. As this "exile" contradicted his claim that he was 
a Prophet of Allah and had His approval and succor with him, some people became 
skeptical about it. Moreover, they became doubtful about the truth of the 
Qur'an, because they were not being visited by the scourge, which was inflicted 
on those who treated the Prophet as false. His antagonists scoffed at him, 
saying, "Where is that succor of Allah and the scourge with which we were 
threatened?" The answer to these doubts of the disbelievers was given in the 
preceding passage, and in this passage the addressees were those who were 
influenced by this propaganda. Briefly the whole answer was to this effect:<br>
<br>"lt is not a new thing that the people of a Messenger have treated him as an 
impostor for it has always been happening like this: You can see from the 
remnants of those peoples who treated their Messengers as impostors how they 
were punished for their mischief. You can learn a lesson from them, if you will. 
As regards the delay in the coming of scourge, the Qur'an never threatened the 
disbelievers ò with immediate punishment, nor is it the job of the Messenger to 
inflict punishments. The scourge is sent by Allah, but He is not hasty in 
sending His torment. He gives respite to the people to mend their ways as He is 
giving you now. Therefore, you should not be under any delusion that the threats 
of scourge are empty threats.<br><br>"It is also not a new thing that the 
desires and wishes of a Prophet meet with obstacles or that false propaganda is 
made against his Message for the same has already happened with regard to the 
Messages of the former Prophets. But ultimately Allah eradicated the mischief 
worked by Satan and made the Message successful. Therefore you should take a 
warning from the past history of Satan's mischiefs and their ultimate failure. 
You should note it well that the obstacles and the mischiefs of Satan are a 
trial and means that help attract the righteous people towards Islam and winnow 
the dishonest people away from it" .<br><br>It is a pity that in spite of the 
above clear and simple meaning of the passage which fits in well with the 
context, a grave misunderstanding has arisen because of a tradition which has 
not only changed its meaning entirely and rendered it irrelevant in the context 
but has helped make doubtful the very basic Articles of the Faith. Therefore we 
are making a critical appraisal of the tradition in order to show how to make 
the right use of traditions for the correct interpretation of the Qur'an.<br>
<br>According to this tradition, the Holy Prophet had a strong longing and 
desire to this effect: "I wish some Revelations were sent down to tone down the 
abhorrence of the mushrik Quraish against Islam so as to bring them nearer to 
it, or at least the criticism against their creed may not be so severe as to 
arouse their enmity" .<br><br>While he was cherishing this desire, it so 
happened that one day when he was sitting in a big gathering of the Quraish, 
Surah An-Najm (LIII) was sent down and he began to recite it. When he came to 
vv. 19, 20: "Have you ever considered about this Lat and this `Uzza, and a third 
(goddess) Manat, "all of a sudden he recited, "These are exalted goddesses; 
indeed their intercession may be expected". After this he continued to recite 
Surah An-Najm up to the last verse and then fell down in prostration and all the 
Muslims and the mushriks of the Quraish also did the same, for the latter said, 
"Now we have no difference with Muhammad; we also profess that Allah is the 
Creator and the Provider and that these deities of ours are merely our 
intercessors with Him" . After this, when in the evening Angel Gabriel came, he 
said, "What have you done? I did not bring these two sentences". At this the 
Holy Prophet became very sad and Allah sent down vv. 73 75 of Surah Bani Isra`il 
(XVII): "O Muhammad! these people have left no stone unturned to tempt you away 
from that which We have revealed to you so that you might fabricate something in 
Our name. Had you done that, they would have made you their friend. It was just 
possible that you might have inclined a little towards them, if We had not given 
you strength. But if you had done so, We would have made you taste double 
chastisement in this world as well as in the Hereafter: then you would have 
found no helper against Us".<br><br>But in spite of this, he continued to be 
grieved till Allah sent down v. 52 of this Surah (Al-Hajj) in which Allah 
consoled him, saying that the same had been happening to the former Prophets.<br>
<br>Another thing that happened in the meantime was that the story reached the 
migrants to Habash that there had been a reconciliation between the Holy Prophet 
and the disbelievers of Makkah. Accordingly, many of them returned to Makkah 
only to learn that the news of reconciliation was wrong and the conflict between 
Islam and kufr was raging as furiously as before.<br><br>Now let us make a 
critical study of this story which has been cited by Ibn Jarir and many other 
commentators and is even contained in many collections of Traditions.<br><br>(1) 
None of its reporters, except Ibn `Abbas, is a Companion.<br><br>(2) There are 
many major discrepancies and variations in its details.<br><br>(3) The wording 
ascribed to the Holy Prophet in praise of the idols in each Tradition is 
different from that of others.<br><br>Moreover, these words have been attributed 
to different sources according to different Traditions: (a) These words were put 
in by Satan during the Revelation and the Holy Prophet imagined that they were 
revealed by Gabriel. (b) He himself uttered these words inadvertently, being 
urged by his own desire. (c) He was dozing when he uttered these words. (d) He 
intentionally uttered these words but in a manner as to question their veracity. 
(e) Satan interpolated these words into the Revelation, giving an impression 
that the Holy Prophet himself had recited them. (f) It was one of the mushriks 
who had recited these words.<br><br>Yet scholars of Tradition like Hafiz Ibn 
Hajar and jurists like Abu Bakr alJassas and rationalists like Zamakhshari and 
commentators like Ibn Jarir accept this story as true and consider it as a 
commentary on verse 52 of this Surah. Ibn Hajar argues like this:<br><br>"Even 
though the links by which this Tradition has been related are either weak or 
"broken", except in one case, the very fact that it has been related through so 
many "links" is a proof that there is some truth about it. The one which has 
strong links is by Said bin Jubair who has related it from Ibn `Abbas and the 
reporters of two more Traditions (which have been cited by Tabari) have been 
declared authentic by Bukhari and Muslim".<br><br>On the other side, there are 
other eminent scholars who declare this story to be utterly baseless. Ibn Kathir 
says, "All the links of this Tradition are unauthentic and I have found no 
correct version of this with continuous links". Baihaqi says, "This story has 
not been proved to be correct by the rules of reporting". When Ibn Khuzaimah was 
asked about it, he said, "This story has been invented by heret cs". Qazi `Ayad 
says, "The very fact that this Tradition is neither contained in any of the six 
authentic collections of Hadith nor has it been related in an authentic way by 
authentic reporters shows its weakness". Besides them, Imam Razi, Qazi Abu Bakr 
Ibn al-`Arabi, Alusi etc. have rejected it altogether.<br><br>It is a pity that 
even those who reject this story have not done full justice to their cases. 
There are some who reject it because its "links" are weak. In other words, they 
would have accepted it, if its links were strong. Then there are others who 
reject it because its acceptance makes the whole Faith doubtful. This kind of 
reasoning may satisfy the believers but it cannot satisfy those who are already 
sceptical or intend to make a research into it with a view to making a correct 
appraisal of Islam. They will rather say, "When a story is related by an eminent 
Companion and is contained in the collections of Traditions, there is no reason 
why we should reject it just because it makes your Faith doubtful".<br><br>Now 
let us consider the story critically and rationally to prove that it is 
unacceptable.<br><br>(1) Its internal evidence proves it to be wrong: (a) 
According to the story the incident happened after the first migration to Habash, 
for according to it some of the migrants returned to Makkah after hearing the 
story. Now the fact is that the migration took place in the month of Rajab of 
the fifth year of Prophethood and some of the migrants returned to Makkah three 
months later, i.e. in Shawwal of the same year. (b) Verses 73-75 of Chapter XVII 
in which the Holy Prophet was "reproved" for this incident were revealed in the 
eleventh or twelfth year of Prophethood. In other words, he was "reproved" by 
Allah five or six years after the incident. (c) This verse (52) in which the 
interpolation by Satan was abrogated was sent down in the first year of Hijrah, 
i.e. about two years after the reproof. Can a person in his senses believe' that 
the Holy Prophet 'was reproved for the interpolation after six years, and it was 
abrogated after nine years ?<br><br>(2) According to the story, this 
interpolation was made in Surah An-Najm. When the Holy Prophet was reciting the 
words, "And a third (goddess) Manat'; he also recited the interpolated sentence, 
and then continued the recital up to the end of the Surah. It is said that the 
disbelievers of Makkah were so pleased with the interpolation that they 
declared, "The differences between us and Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) 
have now come to an end".<br><br>Let us now read w. 19-23 of An-Najm along with 
the alleged interpolation (in italics): "Have you ever considered about the 
reality of this Lat and ` Uzza and a third (goddess) Manat? These are exalted 
goddesses; indeed their intercession may be expected. What, do you have sons for 
yourselves add daughters for Him (Allah) ? This is indeed an unfair division. 
They are nothing but mere names which you and your forefathers have invented. 
Allah has sent down no authority in regard to them. They follow only conjectures 
and the whims of their own minds, although right guidance has come from their 
Lord".<br><br>Even a casual reader will detect an obvious contradiction in the 
passage. Immediately after "praising" the goddesses there is a hard hit on their 
worshipers, as if to say: "O foolish people! How is it that you have ascribed 
daughters to Allah and sons to yourselves? All this is your own invention which 
has no authority from Allah" . On the face of it, the interpolation makes the 
passage absurd which cannot be assigned even to a rational person not to speak 
of Allah. Then the story presumes that all the Quraish who were listening to it 
must have lost their senses; otherwise they could not have declared that their 
differences with Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) had been made up from 
thence.<br><br>From this internal evidence it has become clear that this story 
is absurd and meaningless.<br><br>(3) Now let us consider whether the occasions 
ascribed by the commentators to the revelation of the verses under discussion, 
fit in with the chronological order of the Qur'an. According to the story, the 
interpolation in Surah AnNajm (LIII) was made in the fifth year of Prophethood; 
the reproof was made in vv. 73-75 of Bani Isra'il (XV11) and then the 
interpolation was annulled and the incident explained in vv. 52-54 of Surah 
Al-Hajj (XXII). Now there could be only two possibilities about the time of 
their revelation: either the verses containing the reproof and the abrogation 
were sent down in the period in which the interpolation took place, or the verse 
containing the reproof was sent down along with Surah Al-Hajj (XXII). In the 
first case, the question arises: Why were these verses (XVII: 73-75) not 
inserted in An-Najm (LIII)? Why were they held in abeyance for six long years 
and then inserted in Surah Bani Isra'il (XVII), when it was revealed, and vv. 
52-54 (containing the abrogation) inserted in Surah Al-Hajj (XXII) after a 
further delay of more than two years? Does it mean that the verses were sent 
down on one occasion and inserted years later haphazardly in one Surah or the 
other? In the second case, the question would arise: Does it stand to reason 
that the verses containing the reproof (XVII: 73-75) were sent down six years 
after the interpolation, and the verse of abrogation (XXII: 52) nine years after 
the incident? Still another question arises: What was the occasion of the 
revelation of the verses of reproof and abrogation in Chapters XVII and XXII in 
the context in which they occur?<br><br>(4) Now let us turn to the third 
principle of correct appraisal of the Qur'an.<br><br>For a correct appreciation 
of the Qur'an it is essential to consider whether a particular commentary fits 
in with the relevant context of the Qur'an or not. If we make even a cursory 
study of XVII: 71-73, (Bani Isra'il), it will become obvious that there was no 
occasion for the alleged reproof in v. 73 and that there is no tinge of reproof 
in it, for the words of the verse refute the allegation that the Prophet was 
taken in by the mischief of the disbelievers. Then in Surah AI-Hajj (XXII), if 
we make a critical study of the verses that precede vv. 52-54 and follow them, 
it will become obvious that there was no occasion to console the Prophet for the 
"interpolation" and to annul it after nine years.<br><br>(5) We reiterate that 
no Tradition, however strong links it might have, can be accepted when the Text 
itself is a clear evidence against it, and when it does not fit in with the 
wording, the context, the order etc. of the Qur'an. When the incident is 
considered in this background, even a skeptical research scholar would be 
convinced that the Tradition is absolutely wrong. As regards a believer, he can 
never accept it, when he knows that it contradicts not only one verse but a 
large number of other verses of the Qur'an. He would rather believe, that the 
reporters of the Tradition might have been deluded by Satan and not the Holy 
Prophet. He would never believe that the Holy Prophet could interpolate even a 
single word in the Qur'an under the influence of a desire of his own: or that 
there could ever occur such a desire in his mind that he should make a 
compromise with the disbelievers by associating shirk with Tauhid: or that he 
could ever wish that Allah might not say anything to displease the disbelievers: 
or that the Revelation was made in such an unsafe and doubtful manner as to 
enable Satan to mix with it even a word in a manner as if it was also brought by 
Gabriel. Each of these things is contradictory to the clear Revelation of the 
Qur'an and the basic Articles of the Faith which we have learned from the Qur'an 
and the Holy Prophet. God forbid that we should accept any such Tradition that 
might lead to the above mentioned presumptions just because the Tradition seems 
to be "authentic" in every way.<br><br>It will be worth-while to consider the 
question: How is it that so many reporters of Traditions have related this 
story? Does it not show that there must have been some reality about it? 
Otherwise, so many reporters, who included many authentic and eminent scholars, 
could not have made such an heinous slander against the Qur'an and the Holy 
Prophet. Its answer is contained in the authentic collections of Traditions by 
Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Nasa`i and Musnad Ahmad. The reality of the incident 
is this:<br><br>The Holy Prophet recited Surah An-Najm and performed prostration 
at the end of it. At this, all the hearers, both the Muslims and the mushriks, 
fell down in prostration. This was what really happened and there is nothing 
strange about-it. Let us depict the occasion: The Holy Prophet was reciting a 
forceful piece of the eloquent Qur'an in a very impressive manner. Naturally the 
occasion produced an emotional effect and all the listeners instinctively fell 
down in prostration along with him. It was because of such ecstasies produced by 
the Holy Prophet's recital of the Qur'an as this that the disbelievers dubbed 
him a "sorcerer". As regards the story that the Holy Prophet praised the deities 
of the disbelievers, it appears that the Quraish concocted the story to hide 
their "defeat". Probably someone or other of them explained away their defeat, 
saying, "We ourselves heard Muhammad praising our deities. Therefore we also 
fell down in prostration along with him". As regards the migrants to Habash, 
they returned to Makkah when they heard the concocted story that there had been 
a compromise between the Holy Prophet and the Quraish. It appears that some of 
those people who had seen the Muslims and the mushriks falling down together in 
prostration, presumed that peace had been made between them, so the story 
traveled to the migrants in Habash who had no means to verify it and thus 
thirty-three of them returned to Makkah.<br><br>Naturally these three 
things-prostration by the Quraish, their explanation of it, and the return of 
the migrants from Habash-combined to evolve that story. So much so that some 
authentic people were also deluded by it, for to err is human, and the pious and 
intelligent people are no exception to it. However, the error of the latter 
proves to be more harmful, because their credulous followers accept with closed 
eyes their misconceptions along with their right conclusions. On the other hand, 
mischief mongers collect all such errors of the righteous people and exploit 
them to prove that all the collections of Traditions are false and should be 
rejected forthwith.<br><br>102The epithet "barren" has been applied to the "day" 
in its metaphorical and not literal sense. :A "day" is barren if all the plans, 
hopes and devices remain unproductive in it, or it does not bring forth its 
night. For instance, the days on which the people of Prophet Noah, the tribes of 
`Ad and Thamud, the people of Lot and of Midian met with their destruction by 
scourge from Allah, were barren days in this sense, because those days did not 
bring forth any "tomorrow" for them, and no device of theirs could avert their 
doom. <br><br>103As Allah is All-Knowing, He knows well those who left their 
homes for His sake and what reward they deserve. He is Clement, and forgives 
minor errors and weaknesses of the people; therefore these things will not 
hinder Him from rewarding the Believers for their services and sacrifices.<br>
<br>104The preceding verses referred to those persecuted people who could not 
retaliate and here 'the reference is to those victims of persecution who could 
fight back.<br><br>From this verse, Imam Shafi`i has concluded that 
"retaliation" will be effected in the way as life was taken in the original act. 
If a person is killed by immersion in water, the killer also should be put to 
death by immersion in water; or if a person is .burnt to death, the killer also 
will be burnt to death. The Hanafites dispute this. According to them, 
retaliation against a murderer will be incurred in one and the same established 
way no matter how life was taken by the culprit in the original act.<br><br>
105This verse (60) may imply two things:<br><br>(1) Allah forgives that 
"killing" which is done in self-defense, though killing of people is not a good 
thing in itself. (2) As Allah, Whose slaves the Believers are, is Forgiving and 
Forbearing, they should also forgive and forbear as far as possible. Though they 
have the right of retaliation, they should not resort to carnage and massacre.<br>
<br>106"So it is" (as stated in the preceding paragraph) because Allah is the 
Ruler of the universe and has the power to give punishments and rewards to those 
who deserve them.<br><br>107The fact that "Allah brings forth .........day" is a 
proof that He is the Master, Sovereign and Ruler of the universe. But the deeper 
meaning of the verse is that Allah, Who is able to bring forth the light of the 
day out of the darkness of the night, has the power to bring out the light of 
the Truth out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance, and the light of 
justice out of the darkness of tyranny.<br><br>108He hears everything and sees 
everything and is not unaware of anything.<br><br>109As Allah is in fact the 
Sovereign of the universe, His worshipers will surely attain true success and 
the worshipers of false gods will meet with utter failure.<br><br>110This verse 
has a deeper meaning also, though apparently it merely declares that Allah alone 
has the power to send down rain which makes the land green. The deeper meaning 
is that the rainfall of the blessed Revelation will, in the near future, turn 
the barren land of Arabia into a garden of knowledge, morality and bring forth a 
high and righteous civilization.<br><br>111The original word Latif in the Text 
has no equivalent in English. The word "subtle" has not been used because of its 
bad associations. Latif implies that Allah fulfills His designs in such fine 
ways that it is difficult to understand them till they become real and apparent.<br>
<br>As He is fully aware of everything, He knows how to conduct the affairs of 
His Kingdom.<br><br>112He alone is "All-Sufficient" and does not stand in need 
of anyone in any way. He is "All-praiseworthy" because all praise belongs to Him 
alone whether anyone praises Him or not.<br><br>113Here "the sky" implies the 
whole of the universe above and below the earth where everything is held in its 
own place and sphere.<br><br>114That is, "Though man sees every reality 
presented by the Prophets, yet he denies it".<br><br>115That is, "The Community 
of every Prophet".<br><br>116Here the Arabic word mansak has been used in its 
most comprehensive sense which also includes "sacrifice" (v. 34). It means 
service, worship, in short, "the whole way of life". The same theme has been 
expressed in V: 48: "We prescribed a law and a way of life for each of you".<br>
<br>117That is, "Now you have brought a way of life just as the former Prophets 
brought "ways of life" for their people. Therefore the people have no right to 
dispute with you concerning the "Law" you have brought".<br><br>118This confirms 
the explanation given in E.N. 117 above.<br><br>119In order to understand the 
significance of this paragraph, we should keep in view vv. 55- 57 with which 
this is connected. <br><br>120That is, "Neither there is any mention of their 
deities in any revealed Book nor have they any other source of knowledge about 
them nor any authority to worship them. Therefore, it is sheer ignorance that 
they have associated their self invented deities with Allah and worship them, 
make vows and offer sacrifices to them and supplicate them for their needs etc.<br>
<br>121This is to warn the foolish people that they are absolutely wrong in 
expecting that their deities would help them in this world and in the Hereafter? 
because they have no power to help them. Thus, they will find no helper, for 
Allah alone could help them and they have already displeased Him by their 
rebellious behavior.<br><br>122That is, "You will meet with a far worse state of 
anguish than that which you display against those who recite Divine Revelations 
to you.<br><br>123This parable has been cited to impress upon the 
idol-worshipers that their deities are absolutely powerless, for even if they 
all collaborated to create an insignificant thing like a fly, they could not; 
nay, even if a fly snatched away anything from them they could not prevent it. 
This shows how weak they themselves are and how powerless are the idols they 
supplicate.<br><br>124In continuation of the refutation of shirk, Allah has 
taken two kinds of the most revered of "deities" to show their real status, as 
if to say, "The angels and the Prophets whom you have set up as deities are mere 
Messengers of Allah. Allah has chosen them to convey His Messages to human 
beings and this does not make them God or partners in His Godhead.<br><br>125The 
Qur'an employs this sentence to refute the creed of the mushriks in regard to 
intercession, as if to say, "You imagine that angels, prophets, saints,and the 
like can intercede with Allah on your behalf and therefore you worship them. You 
are absolutely wrong, for none of your deities knows what is good for you and 
what is not: Allah alone hears everything, sees everything and knows everything. 
Therefore He has not given the right of intercession and recommendation to 
anyone except when He Himself is pleased to give such permission."<br><br>
126This is to impress upon them that every affair and every matter, big or 
small, is presented before Allah for a decision. Therefore you should not invoke 
anyone else than Allah, for all others are utterly helpless and powerless and 
cannot even fulfill their own desires and needs.<br><br>127This is the right way 
of attaining we success, but even after adopting these ways of worship and 
performing good deeds one should not rest content or be proud that he would 
surely attain success because he is worshiping Allah and is doing good deeds. He 
should only expect that Allah will by His grace accept his services and bless 
him with we success.<br><br>Imam Shafi`i, Ahmad bin Hanbal, `Abdullah bin 
Mubarak and Ishaq bin Rahawayah hold the view that this verse of Surah Al-Hajj 
requires a `prostration'. But Imam 'Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik, Hasan Basri, Said 
bin al-Musayyab, Said bin Jubair, Ibrahim Nakha`i and Sufyan Thauri dispute 
this. The arguments of the two sides are briefly as follows:<br><br>The former 
group of commentators base their opinion on the following:<br><br>(1) The verb 
in the verse is in the imperative mood.<br><br>(2) The Tradition of `Uqbah bin 
`Amir, which has been reported by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Tirmizi, Ibn Marduyah 
and Baihaqi, says, "I asked, `O Messenger of Allah ! Dces the merit of Surah 
Al-Hajj consist in the fact that it contains two verses requiring prostration?' 
He replied, `Yes, the one who does not prostrate on these two verses, should not 
recite them.' "<br><br>(3) The Tradition of Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah in which `Amr 
bin `As says that he was told by the Holy Prophet that there were two verses 
requiring prostration in Surah Al-Hajj.<br><br>(4) Sayings of Hadrat `Umar, 
`Ali, `Uthman, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Abul Darda, Abu MUsa Ash`ari and `Ammar 
bin Yasir to the effect that Surah AIHajj contains two prostrations.'<br><br>The 
latter group of commentators argue as follows;<br><br>The verse contains a 
command both for Sajdah (prostration) and for Ruku' (bowing in prayer), which 
implies the whole Islamic Prayer according to the Qur'anic usage, and not 
`prostration' alone.<br><br>(2) The tradition reported by 'Uqbah bin `Amir is 
unauthentic as it has weak links.<br><br>(3) The Tradition of 'Amr bin `As is 
also unreliable, because its reporters are not well known.<br><br>(4) As for the 
sayings of the Companions, Ibn 'Abbas has clearly explained that prostration in 
respect of the first verse (in Surah AI-Hajj) is obligatory, whereas in regard 
to the second, it is only suggestive. <br><br>128The Arabic word Jihad is very 
comprehensive. It includes every kind of effort, exertion, conflict and war. 
Jihad for the cause of Allah means that it should be performed for .His service 
and for His approval against those who prevent others from following His Way. 
The performance of Jihad also requires that one should first of all fight 
against one's own self in order to subdue it. For there can be no true Jihad 
unless one fights against one's evil self and subdues one's desires and lusts to 
the obedience of Allah. The Holy Prophet himself has emphasized the need for 
this Jihad. Once when the warriors for the cause of Allah returned from Jihad, 
he said: "You have returned from the lesser Jihad to the' greater Jihad." They 
asked, "What is that greater Jihad.'" The Holy Prophet replied, "It is the Jihad 
against one's own desires and lusts."<br><br>Moreover, the battlefield for Jihad 
is, in fact, the whole world, and Islam demands that one should exert one's 
utmost against all the rebels of Allah and the wicked powers with all of one's 
heart and mind and body and wealth. <br><br>129The direct addressees of this 
were the Companions of the Holy Prophet, for they were the first who had the 
honor to be chosen for this service; others have been addressed only indirectly 
being their followers. This thing has been mentioned in the Qur'an in other ways 
as well. For reference, see II: 143 and III: 110. <br><br>130"(Allah) has not 
laid on you any hardship in your religion." That is, "The creed you have been 
given is very simple and straightforward and the laws and regulations you have 
to obey are practicable. You are free within its bounds to make as much progress 
as you cap." This was to impress that the lives of the Muslims were free from 
all those useless and unnatural restrictions which had been imposed upon the 
former communities by their priests and law-givers. The negative aspect of the 
same thing has been mentioned in V1I: 157: ". . . He enjoins them to follow 
virtue and forbids them from evil: He makes pure things lawful for them and 
impure things unlawful. He relieves them of their burdens and frees thetas from 
the shackles that bound them."<br><br>131Though Islam tray be called the 
religion of Prophets Noah, Moses, Jesus, etc., yet the Qur'an emphasizes over 
and over again that it is the religion of Prophet Abraham. Therefore, "You 
should follow it." This is for three reasons:<br><br>(1) The first addressees of 
the Qur'an were the Arabs who were more familiar with Prophet Abraham than with 
any other Prophet and acknowledged him to be a holy personage and their leader.<br>
<br>(2) Prophet Abraham alone was the person whom the Jews, the Christians, the 
Muslims and the mushriks of Arabia and of the adjoining countries unanimously 
acknowledged as a great Prophet.<br><br>(3) When the Qur'an invites all these 
communities to follow the way of Abraham, it in fact, admonishes them that all 
their religions had been invented long after Prophet Abraham and, therefore, 
were not trustworthy because they contradicted many things taught by him. As for 
the mushriks of Arabia, they also acknowledged that idol-worship among them had 
been started by 'Amr bin Luhayy, who was a leader of Bani Khuza`ah, and had 
brought an idol, called Hubal, from Moab in about 600 B.C. So the religion to 
which Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) invited them 
was the same pure, un-adulterated religion which was taught by Prophet Abraham 
(Allah's peace be upon him).<br><br>For further details, see E.N.'s 134, 135 of 
Chapter II (AI-Baqarah) and E.N.'s 58, 79 of Chapter III (Al-`Imran) and E.N.'s 
119, 120 of Chapter XVI (An-Nahl) <br><br>132Here the word "you" has not been 
addressed exclusively to those Believers who lived at the time of the revelation 
of this verse, or those who believed after its revelation. It includes all those 
human beings, who, from the beginning of human history, believed in Tauhid, the 
Hereafter, Prophethood and the Divine Books. They were not "Jews", "Christians", 
etc., but "Muslims" in the sense that they had surrendered themselves to Allah. 
Likewise the followers of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace and blessings 
be upon him) are not Muhammadans but "Muslims".<br><br>133For Explanation, see 
E. N. 144 of Chapter II (Al-Baqarah).<br><br>134".... hold fast to Allah": 
Follow exclusively the Guidance and the law of Allah: obey Him alone: fear Him 
and have all your hopes and expectations in Him: invoke Him alone for help: 
trust in Him and pray to Him for all your needs.</p>
