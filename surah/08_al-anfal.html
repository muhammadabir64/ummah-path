Allah promised you one of the two (enemy) parties, that it should be yours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but Allah willed to justify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers;-</li><li class="collection-item"> That He might justify Truth and prove Falsehood false, distasteful though it be to those in guilt.</li><li class="collection-item"> Remember ye implored the assistance of your Lord, and He answered you: "I will assist you with a thousand of the angels, ranks on ranks."</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah made it but a message of hope, and an assurance to your hearts: (in any case) there is no help except from Allah: and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness, to give you calm as from Himself, and he caused rain to descend on you from heaven, to clean you therewith, to remove from you the stain of Satan, to strengthen your hearts, and to plant your feet firmly therewith.</li><li class="collection-item"> Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them."</li><li class="collection-item"> This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger: If any contend against Allah and His Messenger, Allah is strict in punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye then of the (punishment): for those who resist Allah, is the penalty of the Fire."</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! when ye meet the Unbelievers in hostile array, never turn your backs to them.</li><li class="collection-item"> If any do turn his back to them on such a day - unless it be in a stratagem of war, or to retreat to a troop (of his own)- he draws on himself the wrath of Allah, and his abode is Hell,- an evil refuge (indeed)!</li><li class="collection-item"> It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah: when thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but Allah´s: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).</li><li class="collection-item"> That, and also because Allah is He Who makes feeble the plans and stratagem of the Unbelievers.</li><li class="collection-item"> (O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed for victory and judgment, now hath the judgment come to you: if ye desist (from wrong), it will be best for you: if ye return (to the attack), so shall We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied: for verily Allah is with those who believe!</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger, and turn not away from him when ye hear (him speak).</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor be like those who say, "We hear," but listen not:</li><li class="collection-item"> For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and the dumb,- those who understand not.</li><li class="collection-item"> If Allah had found in them any good. He would indeed have made them listen: (As it is), if He had made them listen, they would but have turned back and declined (Faith).</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! give your response to Allah and His Messenger, when He calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that Allah cometh in between a man and his heart, and that it is He to Whom ye shall (all) be gathered.</li><li class="collection-item"> And fear tumult or oppression, which affecteth not in particular (only) those of you who do wrong: and know that Allah is strict in punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> Call to mind when ye were a small (band), despised through the land, and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; But He provided a safe asylum for you, strengthened you with His aid, and gave you Good things for sustenance: that ye might be grateful.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye that believe! betray not the trust of Allah and the Messenger, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to you.</li><li class="collection-item"> And know ye that your possessions and your progeny are but a trial; and that it is Allah with Whom lies your highest reward.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! if ye fear Allah, He will grant you a criterion (to judge between right and wrong), remove from you (all) evil (that may afflict) you, and forgive you: for Allah is the Lord of grace unbounded.</li><li class="collection-item"> Remember how the Unbelievers plotted against thee, to keep thee in bonds, or slay thee, or get thee out (of thy home). They plot and plan, and Allah too plans; but the best of planners is Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> When Our Signs are rehearsed to them, they say: "We have heard this (before): if we wished, we could say (words) like these: these are nothing but tales of the ancients."</li><li class="collection-item"> Remember how they said: "O Allah if this is indeed the Truth from Thee, rain down on us a shower of stones form the sky, or send us a grievous penalty."</li><li class="collection-item"> But Allah was not going to send them a penalty whilst thou wast amongst them; nor was He going to send it whilst they could ask for pardon.</li><li class="collection-item"> But what plea have they that Allah should not punish them, when they keep out (men) from the sacred Mosque - and they are not its guardians? No men can be its guardians except the righteous; but most of them do not understand.</li><li class="collection-item"> Their prayer at the House (of Allah) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: (Its only answer can be), "Taste ye the penalty because ye blasphemed."</li><li class="collection-item"> The Unbelievers spend their wealth to hinder (man) from the path of Allah, and so will they continue to spend; but in the end they will have (only) regrets and sighs; at length they will be overcome: and the Unbelievers will be gathered together to Hell;-</li><li class="collection-item"> In order that Allah may separate the impure from the pure, put the impure, one on another, heap them together, and cast them into Hell. They will be the ones to have lost.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say to the Unbelievers, if (now) they desist (from Unbelief), their past would be forgiven them; but if they persist, the punishment of those before them is already (a matter of warning for them).</li><li class="collection-item"> And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease, verily Allah doth see all that they do.</li><li class="collection-item"> If they refuse, be sure that Allah is your Protector - the best to protect and the best to help.</li><li class="collection-item"> And know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire (in war), a fifth share is assigned to Allah,- and to the Messenger, and to near relatives, orphans, the needy, and the wayfarer,- if ye do believe in Allah and in the revelation We sent down to Our servant on the Day of Testing,- the Day of the meeting of the two forces. For Allah hath power over all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> Remember ye were on the hither side of the valley, and they on the farther side, and the caravan on lower ground than ye. Even if ye had made a mutual appointment to meet, ye would certainly have failed in the appointment: But (thus ye met), that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted; that those who died might die after a clear Sign (had been given), and those who lived might live after a Clear Sign (had been given). And verily Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).</li><li class="collection-item"> Remember in thy dream Allah showed them to thee as few: if He had shown them to thee as many, ye would surely have been discouraged, and ye would surely have disputed in (your) decision; but Allah saved (you): for He knoweth well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.</li><li class="collection-item"> And remember when ye met, He showed them to you as few in your eyes, and He made you appear as contemptible in their eyes: that Allah might accomplish a matter already enacted. For to Allah do all questions go back (for decision).</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! When ye meet a force, be firm, and call Allah in remembrance much (and often); that ye may prosper:</li><li class="collection-item"> And obey Allah and His Messenger; and fall into no disputes, lest ye lose heart and your power depart; and be patient and persevering: For Allah is with those who patiently persevere:</li><li class="collection-item"> And be not like those who started from their homes insolently and to be seen of men, and to hinder (men) from the path of Allah: For Allah compasseth round about all that they do.</li><li class="collection-item"> Remember Satan made their (sinful) acts seem alluring to them, and said: "No one among men can overcome you this day, while I am near to you": But when the two forces came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels, and said: "Lo! I am clear of you; lo! I see what ye see not; Lo! I fear Allah: for Allah is strict in punishment."</li><li class="collection-item"> Lo! the hypocrites say, and those in whose hearts is a disease: "These people,- their religion has misled them." But if any trust in Allah, behold!

                      <strong>Name</strong><br><br>The Surah takes its name Al-Anfal (The 
Bounties) from the first verse.<br><br><strong>The Period of Revelation</strong><br>
<br>It was revealed in 2 A. H. after the Battle of Badr, the first battle 
between Islam and kufr. As it contains a detailed and comprehensive review of 
the Battle, it appears that most probably it was revealed at one and the same 
time. But it is also possible that some of the verses concerning the problems 
arising as a result of this Battle might have been revealed later and 
incorporated at the proper places to make it a continuous whole. At any rate, in 
the whole Surah there is nothing that might show that it is a collection of a 
couple of discourses, that have been patched up together.<br><br><strong>
Historical Background</strong><br><br>Before reviewing the Surah, it is 
worthwhile to consider the events that led to the Battle of Badr.<br><br>During 
the first decade or so of the Prophethood at Makkah, the Message had proved its 
firmness, and stability. This was the result of two things. First, the 
Messenger, who possessed the highest qualities of character, was performing his 
Mission with wisdom, foresight and magnanimity. He had shown by his conduct that 
he had made up his mind to carry the movement to a successful end and, 
therefore, was ready to face all sorts of dangers and obstacles in the way. 
Secondly, the Message was so charming that it attracted the minds and hearts of 
the people irresistibly towards itself. So much so that all obstacles of 
ignorance, superstition and petty prejudices failed to check, its advance. That 
is why the Arab upholders of the ways of "ignorance,' who looked down upon it in 
its initial stages, had' begun to reckon it as a serious menace during the last 
period of the stay of the Holy Prophet at Makkah, and were bent on crushing it 
with all the force at their command. But in spite of the above-mentioned 
strength, the movement still lacked certain things to lead it to victory:-<br>
<br>First, it had not yet been fully proved that it had gathered round it a 
sufficient number of such followers who not only believed in its truth, but also 
had such an intense devotion to its principles that they were ready to expend 
all their energies and all that they possessed in the struggle for its success 
and establishment. So much so that they were ready to sacrifice their lives in 
the fight against the whole world itself even though they should be their own 
nearest relative. It is true that the followers of Islam had endured the 
severest persecutions at the hands of the Quraish of Makkah and had given a good 
proof of the firmness of their faith and their strong relation with Islam, yet 
further trials were required to show that Islam had succeeded in acquiring such 
a band of followers which considered nothing dearer than its ideal and was ready 
to sacrifice life for it.<br><br>Secondly, though the voice of Islam had 
reached' every part of the country, its effects were yet scattered and its 
acquired strength was spread here and there: it had not yet gathered sufficient 
force essential for a decisive conflict with the old established order of 
"ignorance".<br><br>Thirdly, Islam had yet no home of its own and had not 
established itself firmly anywhere in the land where it could consolidate its 
power and make it a base for further action. For the Muslims were scattered all 
over the country and were living among the unbelievers as aliens whom their 
bloodthirsty enemies wanted to uproot from their own homes.<br><br>Fourthly, the 
Muslims had not yet had an opportunity to demonstrate practically the blessings 
of the system of life based on Islam. There was neither any Islamic culture, nor 
any social, economic or political system; nor were there any established 
principles of war and peace for their guidance. Therefore the Muslims had no 
opportunity for demonstrating those moral principles on which they intended to 
build their entire system of life; nor had it been proved on the touchstone of 
trial that the Muslims as a community were sincere in their proclamation of the 
Message.<br><br><strong>Allah created opportunities for making up these 
deficiencies.</strong><br><br>During the last four years or so of the Prophet's 
stay at Makkah, the voice of Islam had been proving effective at Yathrab and the 
people for various reasons had been accepting the message more readily than 
other clans of Arabia. So much so that in the twelfth year of Prophethood on the 
occasion of Haj a deputation of 75 people met the Holy Prophet in the darkness 
of night. These people not only accepted Islam, but also offered to give him and 
his followers a home. As this was a most epoch making opportunity provided by 
Allah, the Holy Prophet took advantage of it.<br><br>The significance of this 
offer was quite clear to the people of Yathrab, and they fully realized that 
this was not an invitation to a mere fugitive, but to the Messenger of Allah so 
that he should become their leader and ruler. Likewise they knew that they were 
not inviting the Muslim refugees to give them shelter from persecution but to 
assemble them from all over the country for their integration with themselves to 
form an organized community. Thus the offer of the people of Yathrab was to make 
Yathrab the "City of Islam." Accordingly the Holy Prophet accepted their 
invitation and made it the first "City of Islam" in Arabia.<br><br>And the 
people of Yathrab were fully aware of the implications of this offer. It was 
indeed a declaration of war against the whole of Arabia, and an invitation to 
their own social and economic boycott as well. And when the Ansar from Yathrab 
declared their allegiance to the Holy Prophet at Aqabah, they knew fully well 
its consequences. During the course of the formal declaration of allegiance, 
Asad-bin- Zurarah, the youngest of all the delegates from Yathrab, stood up and 
said, "0 people of Yathrab! Just listen to me and consider the matter carefully 
in all its aspects. Though we have come to him, regarding him only as a 
Messenger of Allah, we should know that we shall be inviting the enmity of the 
whole of Arabia. For when we take him away to Yathrab, we shall be attacked and 
our children may be put to the sword. Therefore if you have the courage in your 
hearts to face it, then and then only, you should declare your allegiance to him 
and Allah will give you its reward. But if you love your lives more than him and 
his Message, then leave this matter and frankly excuse yourselves, for at this 
time Allah may accept your excuses."<br><br>Abbas bin Ubadah bin Naalah, another 
member of the delegation, reiterated the same thing, saying,<br><br>Do you 
understand the implication of the declaration of your allegiance to this 
person?" (Voices, "Yes, we know it.") "You are challenging the whole world to 
war by your declaration of allegiance to him. There is every likelihood of a 
serious menace to your lives and properties. Therefore consider it well. If you 
have any idea lurking in your minds that you will then hand him over to his 
enemies, it is much better to leave him alone now, because that conduct shall 
bring shame and disgrace to you in this world and the next. On the other hand, 
if you have sincerely resolved that you will endure all kinds of consequences 
that will follow as a result of this invitation, then it would be the best thing 
to take the oath of allegiance to him because, by God, this will surely bring 
good to you in this world as well as in the next world."<br><br>At this all the 
members of the delegation cried with one voice, "We are ready and prepared to 
risk all our wealth and our noble kith and kin for his sake."<br><br>It was then 
that the famous oath of allegiance, which is known as the "Second Oath of 
Allegiance at Aqabah" was taken.<br><br>On the other side, the people of Makkah 
also understood fully well the implications of this matter from their own point 
of view. They realized that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), who, they knew 
well, had a great personality and possessed extraordinary abilities, was going 
to gain a strong footing, by this allegiance. For this would help integrate his 
followers, whose constancy, determination, and unwavering fidelity to the 
Messenger had been tried, into a disciplined community under his wise leadership 
and guidance. And they knew that this would spell death for their old ways of 
life. They also realized the strategic importance of. Al-Madinah to their trade, 
which was their chief means of livelihood.<br><br>Its geographical position was 
such that the Muslims could strike with advantage at the caravans traveling on 
the trade route between Yemen and Syria, and thus strike at the root of their 
economy and that of other pagan clans very effectively. The value of the trade 
done by the people of Makkah alone on this route, not to count that of raif and 
other places, amounted to about two hundred thousand dinars annually.<br><br>As 
the Quraish were fully aware of the implications of the oath of allegiance at 
Aqabah, they were greatly perturbed when they got wind of it the same night. At 
first they tried to win over the people of Al-Madinah to their side. But when 
they saw that the Muslims were migrating to Al- Madinah in small groups, they 
realized that the Holy Prophet was also going to emigrate soon from there. Then 
they decided to adopt an extreme measure to prevent this danger.<br><br>A few 
days before his migration, the Quraish held a council to consider the matter. 
After a good deal of argument; they decided that one person should be taken from 
each of the families of Quraish other than that of Banu Hashim to put an end to 
the life of the Holy Prophet. This was to make it difficult for the family of 
the Holy Prophet to fight alone with all the other families of the Quraish and 
thus to force them to accept blood-money for his murder-instead of taking 
revenge from them, but by the grace of Allah their plot against the life of the 
Holy Prophet failed because of his admirable foresight and full trust in Allah, 
and he reached Al- Madinah safe and sound. When they could not prevent his 
emigration, it occurred to them to exploit Abdullah bin Ub`ai who had begun to 
cherish a grievance against the Holy Prophet since his arrival at Al-Madinah. He 
was an influential chief of Al-Madinah and the people had agreed to make him 
their king. But when the majority of Aus and Khazraj clan became Muslims and 
acknowledged the Holy Prophet as their leader, guide and ruler, all his hopes of 
becoming a king came to an end. Therefore the Quraish wrote to him, "As you have 
given shelter to our enemy, we tell you plainly that you should either fight 
with him yourself or exile him from your city otherwise we swear by God that we 
will invade your city, kill your males and make your females our slave girls." 
This letter added fuel to the flames of his jealousy and he was inclined to do 
some mischief, but the Holy Prophet took timely precautions and defeated his 
evil designs.<br><br>The Quraish got another opportunity to hold out a threat. 
When Sa'ad bin Mu'az, another chief of Al-Madinah, went to Makkah to perform `Umrah, 
Abu Jahl interrupted him at the very door of the Kabah, saying, "Do you think we 
will let you perform `Umrah in peace while you give shelter and help to 
renegades from us? Had you not been a guest of Ummayyah bin Khalf, you would not 
have gone alive from here." Sa'ad replied, "By Allah, if you prevent me from 
this, I will retaliate in a worse manner and block your route near Al-Madinah." 
This incident virtually led to a declaration from the people of Makkah that they 
would prevent the Muslims from a pilgrimage to the Kabah, and from the people of 
Al- Madinah that as a retaliation they would block their trade route to Syria 
against the opponents of Islam. As a matter of fact there was no other 
alternative for the Muslims than to keep a strong hold on this route so as to 
force the Quraish, and the other clans, whose interests were vitally bound with 
this route, to reconsider their inimical and antagonistic attitude towards them. 
That is why the Holy Prophet attached the greatest importance to this problem. 
As soon as he was free from making the preliminary arrangements for organizing 
the newly formed Muslim Community and settling peace terms with the neighboring 
Jewish habitations, he adopted two measures in this connection:-<br><br>First, 
he entered into negotiations with those clans who lived between the Red Sea and 
this route so as to make alliances with them or at east to persuade them to make 
treaties of neutrality with the Muslims. He was successful in this, and he 
entered into a treaty of non-alignment with Juhainah, which was a very important 
clan of the hilly tract near the sea coast. Then, at the end of the first year 
of Hijrah, he made a treaty of defensive alliance with Bani Damrah, who lived 
near Yanb'u and Zawal Ushairah. In 2 A. H. Bani Mudlij also joined the alliance, 
as they were the neighbors and allies of Bani Damrah. Then ii so happened that 
quite a large number of these people were converted to Islam as a result of the 
missionary work done by the Muslims.<br><br>Secondly, he successively sent small 
bands of his men on this route to serve as a warning to the Quraish, and himself 
accompanied some of them. In the first year of Hijrah, four expeditions were 
sent there, that is, the expedition under Hamzah, the expedition under Ubaidah 
bin Harith, the expedition under Sa'ad bin Abi Waqqas and the Al-Abwa' 
expedition under the Holy Prophet himself. In the first month of the second year 
two more incursions were made on the same route. These are known as Buwat 
Expedition and Zawal Ushairah Expedition. Two things about all these expeditions 
are noteworthy. First, no blood was shed and no caravans were plundered in any 
of these expeditions. This proves that the real object of these expeditions was 
to show to the Quraish which way the wind was blowing. Secondly, not a single 
man from the people of Al-Madinah was sent by the Holy. Prophet on any of these 
incursions. All the bands consisted purely of the immigrants from Makkah so that 
the conflict should remain between the people of the Quraish themselves and 
should not further spread by the involvement of other clans. On the other side, 
the Quraish of Makkah tried to involve others also in the conflict. When they 
sent bands towards Al-Madinah, they did not hesitate to plunder the people. For 
instance, an expedition under the leadership of Kurz bin Jabir al-Fihrl 
plundered the cattle of the people of Al-Madinah from the very vicinity of the 
city to show what their real intentions were.<br><br>This was the state of 
affairs when, in Sha'aban, 2 A. H. (February or March, 623 A. D.) a big trade 
caravan of the Quraish, carrying goods worth $50,000 or so, with only a guard of 
thirty to forty men, on its way back from Syria to Makkah, reached the territory 
from where it could be easily attacked from Al-Madinah. As the caravan was 
carrying trade goods worth thousands of pounds, and was scantily guarded, 
naturally Abu Sufyan, who was in charge of it, from his Past experience feared 
an attach from the Muslims. Accordingly, as soon as he entered the dangerous 
territory, he dispatched a camel rider to Makkah with a frantic appeal for help. 
When the rider reached Makkah, he, following an old custom of Arabia, tore open 
the ears of his camel, cut open his nose and overturned the saddle. Then rending 
his shirt from front and behind, he began to cry aloud at the top of his voice, 
"O people of Quraish dispatch help to protect your caravan from Syria under the 
charge of Abu Sufyan, for Muhammad with his followers is in pursuit of it; 
otherwise I don't think you will ever get your goods. Run, run for help." This 
caused great excitement and anger in the whole of Makkah and all the big chiefs 
of the Quraish got ready for war. An army, consisting of 600 armored soldiers 
and cavalry of 100 riders with great pomp and show marched out for a fight. They 
intended not only to rescue the caravan but also to put to an end, once for all, 
the new menace from the Muslims who had consolidated themselves at Al-Madinah. 
They wanted to crush that rising power and overawe the clans surrounding the 
route so as to make it absolutely secure for future trade.<br><br>Now the Holy 
Prophet, who always kept himself well informed of the state of affairs, felt 
that the decisive hour has come and that was the right time when he must take a 
bold step; otherwise the Islamic Movement would become lifeless for ever and no 
chance would be left for it to rise again. For if the Quraish invaded Al-Madinah, 
the odds would be against the Muslims. The condition of the Muslim Community was 
still very shaky because the immigrants (Muhajirin) had not been able to 
stabilize their economy during the short period (less than two years) of their 
stay at Al-Madinah; their helpers, (the Ansar) had not yet been tried; and the 
neighboring Jewish clans were antagonistic. Then there was a strong group of 
hypocrites and mushriks in Al- Madinah itself; above all, the surrounding clans 
lived in awe of the Quraish and had all their religious sympathies with them. 
The Holy Prophet, therefore, felt that the consequences of this possible 
invasion would not be favorable to the Muslims.<br><br>The second possibility 
was that they would not invade Al-Madinah but try only to escort their caravan 
safely and securely by a mere show of force. In that case, too, if the Muslim 
remained inactive, it would affect their reputation adversely. Obviously, this 
weak stand in the conflict would embolden the other Arabs also and make the 
position of the Muslims very insecure in the country and the surrounding clans 
would, at the instance of the Quraish, start hostilities against them, and the 
Jews, the hypocrites and the mushriks of Al- Madinah would openly rise against 
them and not only endanger their security of life, property and honor but make 
it difficult for them even to live there.<br><br>The Muslims would not be able 
to inspire the enemy with awe so as to keep safe from them their life, property 
and honor. A careful study of the situation led the Holy Prophet to make up his 
mind to take a decisive step and go into the battle with whatever little 
strength he could muster, for thus and thus only could he show whether the 
Muslim Community had the right to survive or was doomed to perish.<br><br>When 
he arrived at this momentous decision, he called the Muhajirin and the Ansar 
together and placed the whole position before them, without any reservation. He 
said, "Allah has promised that you will confront one of the two, the trade 
caravan coming from the north or the army of the Quraish marching from the 
south. Now tell me which of the two you want to attack!" A large majority of the 
people replied that they wanted to attack the caravan. But the Holy Prophet who 
had something else before him, repeated the same question. At this Miqdad bin 'Amr, 
a Muhajir, stood up and said, "0 Messenger of Allah! Please march to the side to 
which your Lord commands you; we will accompany you wherever you go. We will not 
say like the Israelites, 'Go and let you and your Lord fight we will wait'. In 
contrast to them we say, 'Let you and your Lord fight; we will fight by your 
side to our last breath'." Even then he did not announce any decision but waited 
for a reply from the Ansar who had not yet taken any part in any battle of 
Islam. As this was the first opportunity for them to prove that they were ready 
to fulfill their promise of fighting for the cause of Islam, he repeated the 
question without directly addressing them. At this, Sa'ad bin Mu'az, an Ansar, 
stood up and said, "Sir, it appears that you are putting the question to us." 
When the Holy Prophet said, "Yes", the Ansar replied, "We have believed in you 
and confirmed that what you have brought is the Truth, and have made a solemn 
pledge with you that we will listen to you and obey you. Therefore, 0 Messenger 
of Allah, do whatever you intend to do. We swear by Allah Who has sent you with 
the Truth that we are ready to accompany you to the sea shore and if you enter 
it, we will plunge into it. We assure you that not a single one of us will 
remain behind or forsake you, for we will not hesitate at all to go to fight, 
even if you should lead us to the battlefield tomorrow. We will remain steadfast 
in the battle and sacrifice our lives in the fight. We do hope that by the grace 
of Allah our behavior will gladden your heart. So, trusting in Allah's blessing, 
take us to the battlefield."<br><br>After these speeches it was decided that 
they should march towards the army of the Quraish and not towards the trade 
caravan. But it should be noted that the decision was of an ordinary nature. For 
the number of people, who came forward to go to the battlefield, was only a 
little more than three hundred (86 Muhajirs, 62 from Aus and 170 from Khazraj). 
Then the little army was ill-armed and hardly equipped for battle. Only a couple 
of them had horses to ride and the others had to take their turn in threes and 
fours on the back of a camel, out of the 70 they had in all. Above all, they had 
not got enough weapons for the battle; only 60 of them had armors. It is, 
therefore, no wonder that with the exception of those who were prepared to 
sacrifice their lives for the cause of Islam, the majority of those who had 
joined the expedition, were so filled with fear that they felt as if they were 
knowingly going into the jaws of death. Then there were people who always looked 
at things from a selfish point of view. Though they had embraced Islam, they did 
not realize that their faith would demand the sacrifice of their lives and 
properties from them; they were of the opinion that it was a mad expedition 
prompted by irrational enthusiasm for religion. But the Holy Prophet and the 
true Believers had realized the urgency of that critical hour which required the 
risk of life: therefore they marched straight to the south-west, wherefrom the 
army of the Quraish was coming. This is a clear proof of the fact that from the 
very beginning they had gone out to fight with the army and not to plunder the 
caravan. For if they had aimed at plundering the caravan they would have taken 
the north- westerly direction and not the south- westerly one.<br><br>The two 
parties met in combat at Badr on the seventeenth of Ramadan. When the two armies 
confronted each other and the Holy Prophet noticed that the Quraish army 
outnumbered the Muslims by three to one and was much better equipped, he raised 
his hands up in supplication and made this earnest prayer with great humility: 
"O Allah! Here are the Quraish proud of their war material: they have come to 
prove that Thy Messenger is false. O Allah! now send that success that Thou hast 
promised to give me. O Allah! If this little army of Thy servants is destroyed, 
then there will be left none in the land to worship Thee."<br><br>In this combat 
the emigrants from Makkah were put to the hardest test for they had to fight 
against their own near and dear relatives and put to the sword their fathers, 
their sons, their paternal and maternal uncles and their brothers. It is obvious 
that only such people could have come out successful in this hardest of tests as 
had accepted the Truth sincerely and cut off all relations with falsehood. And 
in another way the test to which the Ansar were put was not less hard. So far 
they had only alienated the powerful Quraish and their allies by giving shelter 
to the Muslims against their wishes but now, for the first time, they were going 
to give fight to them and to sow the seeds of a long and bitter war with them. 
This was indeed a very hard test for it meant that a small town with a 
population of a few thousand inhabitants was going to wage a war with the whole 
of Arabia. It is obvious that only such people could take this bold step who 
believed in the Truth of Islam so firmly that they were ready to sacrifice every 
personal interest for its sake.<br><br>So Allah accepted the self-sacrifices of 
the Muhajirin and the Ansar because of their true faith, and rewarded them with 
His success. The proud, well- armed Quraish were routed by these ill-equipped 
devotees of Islam. Seventy men of their army were killed and seventy captured as 
prisoners and their arms and equipment came into the hands of the Muslims as 
spoils of war. All their big chiefs, who were their best soldiers and who had 
led the opposition to Islam, were killed in this Battle. No wonder that this 
decisive victory made Islam a power to be reckoned with. A Western research 
scholar says that before the Battle of Badr, Islam was merely a religion and a 
state but after the Battle it became the state religion, nay, the state itself.<br>
<br>Topics of Discussion<br><br>It is this great Battle that has been reviewed 
in this Surah. But let it be noted that in some respects this review is quite 
different from the reviews that are usually made by the worldly commanders after 
a great victory.<br><br>Instead of gloating over the victory, the moral 
weaknesses that had come to the surface in that expedition have been pointed out 
so that the Muslims should try their best to reform themselves.<br><br>It has 
been impressed upon them that the victory was due to the success of Allah rather

help of the needy.<br><br>Then it also gives normal instructions concerning the 
laws of peace and war for these were urgently needed to be explained at the 
stage which the Islamic Movement had entered. It enjoined that the Muslims 
should refrain from ways of "ignorance" in peace and war and thus should 
establish their moral superiority in the world. It also meant, to demonstrate to 
the world in actual practical life the morality which it had been preaching to 
the world from the very beginning of Islam and had been enjoining that practical 
life should be based on the same.<br><br>It also states some articles of the

the problems of the "Spoils of War". The Quran says that these are not the 
spoils of war but the "Bounties of Allah" and proves this by showing that the 
victory at Badr (and in all other battles, too,) was won by His succor and not 
by the efforts of the Muslims. It also declares (in v. 40) that the war aim of 
the Muslims should be to eliminate all unfavorable conditions for the 
establishment of Islam and not to gain spoils. Moreover, the spoils, being the 
bounties of God, belong to Allah and His Messenger and they alone are entitled 
to allocate them. Then after conditioning the Muslims to accept these things, 
the different shares have been allocated in v. 41. 1 - 41<br><br>The Battle of 
Badr was ordained by Allah so that Islam should triumph over "ignorance". The 
lesson from this is that the Muslims should trust in God and prepare themselves 
for war and should not be beguiled by Satan as the disbelievers were. 42 - 54<br>
<br>Sanctity of treaties has been enjoined and the Muslims commanded to observe 
them as long as the other party does not break them. 55 - 59<br><br>The Muslims 
should always be prepared for war on every front, but should be ready to make 
peace if the other party is inclined towards it. 60 - 66<br><br>In these verses,

<hr>
<p>1A dispute arose among the Muslims concerning the division of the spoils of 
victory after the Battle of Badr, Allah used this opportunity for the benefit of 
the Muslims and gave instructions for the solution of the problems of peace and 
war.<br><br>As Badr was the first battle fought under the flag of Islam, 
naturally the Muslims were unaware of the Islamic laws about war and the 
problems, created by it. Some preliminary instructions had already been given in 
Surahs Al-Baqarah and Muhammad, but more instructions were needed for the 
"humanization of war", because their notions were still the same that they had 
during the pre-Islamic days. That is why according to the old usage each Muslim 
claimed to be the rightful owner of the spoils which came in his hand after the 
victory. But there were others, who had gone in pursuit of the enemy instead of 
plundering the spoils, They claimed that they, too, were entitled to a share of 
the spoils, for, they said, "If we had not pursued the enemies to a long 
distance, they would have come back and by a surprise attack turned the victory 
into a defeat". There were still others, who were standing guard for the Holy 
Prophet: they also claimed a share, saying that they had rendered the greatest 
service in the Battle by protecting the person of the Holy Prophet, for, without 
this, there could have been no victory at all. But the people of the first group 
who possessed the spoils, were adamant and were not amenable to any reason 
whatever; for them, possession was the strongest of all arguments. By and by, 
the dispute began to take a very serious turn.<br><br>It was at this 
psychological moment that Allah sent down Surah Al-Anfal and chose the same 
thorny problem for the introduction of the review of the Battle of Badr. And it 
is a miracle of the Divine Book that it solved the thorny problem in a few 
words. The very first sentence- "They ask you concerning the bounties?"-that 
introduced the problem contained its solution. The use of the Arabic 
word(anfal), bounties', instead of (ghana'im),spoils of victory', provided the 
answer to the problem. The word(anfal) is the plural of (nafl). It means 
something which is in addition to the thing to which one is entitled by right. 
When that something is from the servant, it denotes the additional service to 
what is obligatory on the servant, but when it is from the master it denotes the 
additional reward which is bestowed on the servant as a bounty over and above to 
what the servant is entitled. The verse, therefore, implies: "Are you having a 
dispute concerning the bounties of Allah? If these are not the spoils of 
victory, but the bounties of Allah, who arc you to decide about their division? 
It is for the Giver of the bounties to decide whom to give and how much. "<br>
<br>This conception of the spoils of victory helped to bring about a great moral 
reform in the attitude towards war. Muslims do not go to war for the sake of 
material gains but for the sake of reforming the moral and social evils in the 
world in accordance with the principles of the Truth; and that they wage war 
only when the opposing forces make it impossible for them to carry out the 
reform work by means of preaching and teaching. Therefore the reformers must 
keep in view only that aim and object and not the material gains that may be 
bestowed on them by Allah as His bounties. That is why the Muslims were warned 
after the very first battle for the cause of Islam to guard themselves against 
the material gains of the battle lest these should become the sole aim and 
object of the fight.<br><br>This also brought about a great reform in connection 
with the division of the spoils of war. Formerly these spoils became the 
property of anyone who got possession of them, or of the commander or of the 
king who became the owner of the whole of them. In the first case, the 
selfishness of the soldiers of the victorious army led to a bitter competition 
for the grabbing of spoils and sometimes even brought about a civil war with all 
its horrible consequences. In the second case, the soldiers would resort to 
pilfering, which would degrade them to the low level of thieves. The Qur'an 
reformed these evils by declaring the spoils of war to be the property of Allah 
and His Messenger, and then further on in v. 41 by laying down equitable shares 
for its fair division. The first reform demanded that all these spoils, be they 
worth much or little, should be brought at one place before the chief commander. 
Then by the second reform, one-fifth of this should be kept for the Islamic 
State for the cause of Allah and for the help of the poor, and the remaining 
part should be divided among all those who had taken part in the battle. In this 
way the evils of the age of "ignorance" were reformed to the satisfaction of 
all.<br><br>Here this subtle point should also be kept in view: the Qur'an 
leaves the problem of the division after declaring that these bounties belong to 
Allah and the Messenger, and does not even touch it so that the minds should 
first be prepared for obedience and its acceptance: Then in v. 41 it gives the 
Command for the division of the spoils. That is why these have been called the 
`bounties' here and the `spoils' of war in v. 41. <br><br>2This implies that a 
man's Faith increases on every occasion he acknowledges the Revelations of Allah 
to be true, and submits to them. Most surely his Faith increases and grows, 
whenever he surrenders himself to the Book of Allah and to the teachings of the 
Holy Prophet though they may be against his own desires, his opinions, his 
conceptions, his theories, his habits, his interests, his lusts, his comforts, 
his affections and his friendships. For, instead of changing the teachings, he 
changes himself in accordance with the Commands of Allah and the instructions of 
the Holy Prophet, and accepts them for his guidance. In contrast to this, if a 
believer hesitates to accept these, his Faith begins to decrease and fade away.<br>
<br>This also shows that Faith is not something that is incapable of growth and 
increase and which always remains in one and the same state, but it is capable 
of both improvement and decay. Every denial of the Truth corrupts its quality, 
and likewise every acknowledgment and acceptance improves it. But as far as the 
grading of the rights and ranks of the people, according to the acceptance or 
denial of the Truth, is concerned, all the Muslims shall be placed in one and 
the same position, and likewise the non-Muslims. In the Islamic society, the 
legal rights and obligations of all the Muslims shall be the same, irrespective 
of the differences in the quality of the Faith. In the same way, the non-Muslims 
shall be Zimmis or belligerents or allies of the same rank, irrespective of the 
quality of their denial of the Islamic Faith.<br><br>3The promise, that the 
shortcomings of the believers shall be forgiven, gives great solace to them, for 
everyone, however great and good he may be, is liable to commit offenses and it 
is not at all possible that a human being will always do such deeds as conform 
in every case to the highest standard and are absolutely free from defect, 
deficiency and fault. Allah, however, shows one of His greatest blessings to 
those who perform obligatory duties, and forgives their shortcomings by His 
grace, and rewards His servants with a far greater recompense than the one they 
deserve. Otherwise, if His rule had been to reward and punish each and every 
virtue and vice separately, then even the most righteous people could not have 
escaped punishment. <br><br>4The verse may mean either of the two things: as 
translated it means at that time the Truth required that they should go to the 
fight but they were afraid of this; and now the Truth required that they should 
not argue concerning the spoils of war and wait for the Command, but they did 
not seem to submit to this for the sake of the Truth. The second meaning will be 
this: "In the Battle of Badr, you have seen with your own eyes the good results 
of following the Truth. Although you were afraid of going to the fight as if you 
were being driven towards death, yet by obeying Allah and His Messenger, you won 
a great victory: likewise, if you now abide by the Truth in regard to the 
division of the spoils and submit to the Command of Allah and obey the decision 
of the Holy Prophet instead of yielding to the desires of your hearts, you will 
see good results with your own eyes".<br><br>Incidentally, verses 5-6 refute all 
those traditions about the Battle of Badr that are related in the books on the 
life of the Holy Prophet and his wars. They say that the real plan of the Holy 
Prophet and his followers was to plunder the caravan and accordingly they had 
marched out of AI-Madinah for the same purpose. But when they had traveled some 
distance, they learned that an army of the Quraish was corning for the 
protection of the caravan, and they held a council to decide whether to attack 
the caravan or the army. The Qur'an, however, contradicts this. It says that 
Allah brought forth the Holy Prophet from his home with the Truth at the very 
beginning and he had this Truth before him that they should meet the army of the 
Quraish in a decisive battle. For these consultations were held before they had 
started from AI-Madinah and not after. It was then that some Muslims were 
arguing with the Holy Prophet concerning the Truth that they should go to meet 
the army of the Quraish, though it had become quite evident to them. That was 
why these people felt as though they were being driven towards death, when they 
were commanded to march out of Al-Madinah at the very start of the expedition.<br>
<br>5That is, the trade caravan, or the army of the Quraish. <br><br>6That is, 
the trade caravan, that was accompanied by a guard band numbering between thirty 
and forty. <br><br>7This makes it clear that the march of the army of the 
Quraish towards AI-Madinah amounted to a challenge from the system of 
'ignorance' to the system of Islam, as stated in the Introduction to this Surah. 
Allah willed that the Muslims should accept that challenge and fight a decisive 
battle for the survival of Islam in Arabia. If the Muslims had not marched out 
boldly on that occasion, they would have lost all chances of their survival. 
Their bold march and victory at Badr in the very first battle crushed the power 
of the Quraish and created such favorable conditions for Islam that after this 
it went on defeating the system of "ignorance".<br><br>8The Muslims experienced 
the same thing during the Battle of Uhd. (III: 154). On both these critical 
occasions, Allah filled the hearts of the Muslims with such peace and security 
that they were overpowered by drowsiness. <br><br>9On the eve of the Battle of 
Badr, there was a rainfall, which helped the Muslims in three ways. First, they 
got an opportunity of storing water in reservoirs. Secondly, it made the sandy 
ground hard in the upper part of the valley where the Muslims were camping and 
they could move about with steady footsteps. Thirdly, it created difficulties 
for the army of the disbelievers who were camping in the lower part of the 
valley for the rain-water gathered there and made the ground marshy and their 
feet sank into the mud.<br><br>"The defilement caused by Satan" was the fear and 
confusion he had imbued in their minds because of the coming battle. The 
God-sent rainfall and slumber at that critical occasion helped to remove that 
fear and confusion.<br><br>10From what we have learned about the basic 
principles from the Qur'an, we are of the opinion that the angels were not 
employed directly to take part in fighting and killing but probably they were 
used to help the Muslims in making their strokes hard and effective. But the 
true knowledge is with Allah.<br><br>11Up to this place references have been 
made one by one to some events in connection with the Battle of Badr: this is to 
show the real significance of the Arabic word anfal. At the very beginning of 
the Surah, it is decreed that 'bounties belong to Allah and the Messenger and 
not to you because the spoils are not the fruit of your efforts.' As a proof of 
this, these events have been enumerated for the consideration of the Believers 
and they have been asked to judge for themselves how much they contributed to 
the spoils by their courage and bravery and how these owed to the bounty of 
Allah. <br><br>12The address has been suddenly turned to the disbelievers 
because of the mention of the punishment they deserved. <br><br>13The Qur'an 
does not forbid an orderly retreat if necessitated by military strategy. It is 
lawful to retreat if there is a hard pressure of the enemy, and the fighting 
troops retreat to get re-enforcements or to join another pan of the army in the 
rear. However, what has been forbidden is a rout in utter defeat, involving 
disorderly and cowardly flight for safety. Such a retreat is obviously a heinous 
sin, because it is to save one's own life and it deserves the most painful 
retreat in Hell. Any one, who runs away in disorder from the battlefield, does 
so because he loves his own life more than the cause for which he professed to 
fight. Accordingly the Holy Prophet condemns this emphatically, saying, "There 
are three sins which make virtue vain-shirk, violation of the rights of parents 
and flight from the battlefield, when fighting in the Way of Allah." Likewise in 
another Tradition, he mentions seven sins that are ruinous and destructive for 
the Life-after-death. One of these is that one should turn one's back to the 
disbelievers and run away from the conflict between Islam and kufr. Such a rout 
is condemned because, besides being a cowardly act, it leads to serious 
consequences: the flight of one soldier may cause the rout of a platoon and that 
in turn of a regiment or of the whole army. Then it is also possible that the 
rout of the army might ruin the whole country. <br><br>14This refers to an event 
that happened during the Battle of Badr. After single bouts, when a general 
fight was going to ensue, the Holy Prophet took a handful of sand and threw it 
towards the army of the disbelievers, saying, "May their faces be scorched." At 
the same time he made a gesture and the Muslims attacked the disbelievers in a 
body.<br><br>15This refers to the prayer that was offered by the Quraish at the 
Ka'abah before they marched for the fight. The mushriks held the curtains of the 
Ka`abah and prayed: "O Allah! grant victory to the better of the two parties." 
Abu Jahl particularly invoked Allah's decision, saying, "O God! grant victory to 
that party which is in the right, and disgrace that one which is the aggressor. 
"<br><br>Accordingly Allah gave His decision and granted their prayer to the 
letter by giving a signal victory to the Muslims to show that they were the 
better of the two parties and were in the right. <br><br>16This exposes the 
attitude of the hypocrites, who heard the Truth with their ears, yet did not 
accept and believe in it: they professed to believe but did not obey the 
Commands.<br><br>17That is, "Those who do not listen to the Truth and do not 
utter it with their tongues, are deaf and dumb concerning the Truth."<br><br>
18As those hypocrites had no love for the Truth and no desire to work in its 
cause, they would have turned their backs from the Battle at the first critical 
juncture, even if Allah had helped them to obey the Command and march to the 
battlefield. Thus their company would have proved to be harmful rather than 
useful.<br><br>19In vv. 21-23, the Believers were warned to guard against 
behaving like the hypocrites and here the remedy is being prescribed for it. The 
most effective antidote against hypocritical behavior is the belief in Allah and 
the life in the Hereafter. If a person sincerely believes that he has to deal 
with that Allah Who knows everything-even the intentions, desires, designs, 
thoughts, etc., hidden in the hearts arc known to Him- and that one has 
ultimately to return to Him, he will try his best to refrain from such a 
behavior. That is why the Qur'an mentions these two articles of Faith over and 
over again as a remedy to cure the evil of hypocrisy. <br><br>20"That mischief" 
refers to those collective evils that are not confined to individuals but are so 
widespread that a large number of persons in a locality become addicted to these 
at the same time. In such a case, it is not the wrongdoers alone who are seized 
by the scourge of Allah but also those few people who arc involved in those 
evils. This is because they put up with life in such evil surroundings.<br><br>
In order to illustrate this, let us consider the case of a town from the point 
of view of its sanitary conditions. If filth lies scattered at a few places, its 
evil effects remain confined to that particular locality or localities and only 
those people who keep their houses or persons dirty suffer from the consequent 
diseases. But if filth gets scattered all over the town and there is no one to 
prevent it and restore sanitary conditions, then the air, the water and the soil 
will all be contaminated and become so poisonous as to cause the outbreak of an 
epidemic in the whole town. Obviously it will not discriminate between those who 
scattered the tilth and those who refrained from it, but will affect all the 
people who live in those surroundings. The same is the case of moral impurity, 
corruption and obscenity. If these evils are found in some persons individually 
but the fear of the good people of the society keeps them under check, the evil 
effects remain confined to the wrongdoers alone. On the other hand, if the 
collective conscience of the society becomes so weak that it cannot keep the 
evil suppressed, and the wrongdoers, the indecent and the unmoral people become 
so bold that they begin to commit their filthy acts openly, that mischief takes 
the forth of an epidemic of immorality. Then even those good people who remain 
content with their own individual goodness and adopt a passive attitude towards 
the widespread evils, fall victims to the consequent scourge because they did 
nothing to prevent the spread of the epidemic.<br><br>In this way Allah 
impresses upon the Muslims the importance of the mission of reform and guidance 
for which the Messenger had risen and to which he was inviting them, as if to 
say, "There is life for you as individuals and as Community in this work. If you 
do not sincerely exert for its achievement and for the eradication of evils, an 
epidemic of evils will break out which will involve in its scourge all of you, 
even though there may be some among you who might. not have been guilty of 
either the commission of those evils or of their spread; nay, they might have 
been leading good lives as individuals" . The same thing has already been 
enunciated in VII :164. And this may be regarded as the fundamental principle of 
that war which has been permitted by Islam for the reform of the people in 
general. <br><br>21The words "...so that you may be grateful" are very 
significant in the context in which they occur. They require that the Muslims 
should not merely acknowledge the kindness of Allah that He brought them out of 
their weak position in Makkah to the security of Al-Madinah and provided them 
with pure and good things of life. They should also show their gratitude in a 
practical manner and obey Allah and His Messenger and work sincerely and 
devotedly for the success of his mission, facing bravely, with trust in God, the 
dangers, hardships, obstacles and misfortunes that come in the way. They should 
firmly believe that if they sincerely exert in the way of Allah, He will most 
surely become their Guardian and Helper as before and bring them out safely from 
all sorts of dangers. Thus gratitude does not mean mere acknowledgment; it has 
to be given a practical shape as well. It is not gratitude if one acknowledges 
the kindness of a benefactor but does nothing to please him or serve him 
sincerely or entertains doubts about the kindness of the benefactor in future; 
it is ingratitude. <br><br>22"Your trusts" is a very comprehensive term and 
includes all those things that are entrusted to anyone for fulfillment, whether 
they concern individuals or communities. For instance, one should not violate 
treaties and agreements or betray secrets of community or misappropriate 
property and office entrusted to one's care. (For further details, please refer 
to E.N. 88 of An-Nisa). <br><br>23Worldly goods and children generally prove to 
be the greatest temptations that lead a person to the ways of hypocrisy, 
treachery and dishonesty. That is why Allah has warned the Believers to be on 
their guard against indulging in too much love of money and children, as if to 
say, "This world is a big Examination Hall, and Your wealth and Your children 
are two of its question papers. These have been given to you only to test 
whether you fulfill their prescribed rights and keep the prescribed limits; 
whether you walk straight on the Right Way while carrying the burden of 
responsibilities or swerve from it because of the attractions of allurements and 
temptations; and whether you control your "self' which is liable to become their 
slave in a way that it remains the slave of Allah, and at the same time renders 
their rights in the way He has prescribed. <br><br>24The Believers have been 
assured that if they behave in a God-fearing way, Allah will provide them with 
the criterion (that is, the true knowledge and the right understanding of all 
affairs), to enable them to discern between right and wrong. Thus, if they so 
intend, they will be able to do the Will of God and follow the way He approves 
of. That criterion will serve as a signal at every turning, every crossing, 
every up and down and show them the Right Way, the Way of God, and warn them of 
the false ways, the ways of Satan.<br><br>25This plot was made at the time when 
the Quraish realized that the Holy Prophet also was going to migrate to 
Al-Madinah. They felt that if he succeeded in emigrating from Makkah, he would 
be out of their reach and become formidable. Accordingly they held an urgent 
meeting of their chiefs in Dar-un-Nadvah (Council House) to discuss the matter 
and come to a final decision in regard to him. Some were of the opinion that he 
should be chained and imprisoned for life. But this plan was not approved for it 
was feared that his Companions would go on working for the mission and would do 
their best to release him, even at the risk of their own lives, as soon as they 
would gain some power. The others proposed that he should be exiled from Makkah 
for that would at least relieve them of the `disorder' he was creating among 
them. Then it would not matter for them where he lived and what he did. But the 
chiefs rejected this plan, saying, "This man possesses the art of a charming 
speech and of winning hearts. If he leaves this place, he may go to the other 
Arab clans and win them over to his side, and then after gaining power, he may 
attack Makkah". At last Abu Jahl, putting forward his plan, said, "Let us select 
from each of our families one strong, stout and smart young man of high rank. 
They should all attack Muhammad at one and the same time and kill him. In this 
way, the responsibility for his blood will be divided equally among all the 
families of the Quraish, and it will not be possible for Banu `Abd Manaf, the 
family of Muhammad, to fight with all of them and they will be forced to accept 
blood-money for him". They approved this plan unanimously and nominated young 
men to kill him at the appointed time. Accordingly the would-be murderers 
reached their places on the night fixed for the crime, but the Holy Prophet, 
throwing dust in their eyes, escaped safely from Makkah. Thus their plot ended 
in utter failure at the eleventh hour.<br><br>26These words were not uttered as 
a prayer but as a challenge. What they really meant was this: Had this been 
really the Truth sent down by God, He would have rained down stones on us from 
heaven or sent down some other painful torment on us, in consequence of its 
rejection by us. But as nothing of the sort has happened, it means that it is 
neither the Truth nor has it been sent down by Allah.<br><br>27This is the 
answer to their challenge that was implied in their seeming prayer. They have 
been told that a torment was not sent down during the Makkan period because of 
the presence of the Messenger in their midst. For Allah gives respite to the 
people to reform themselves as long as the Messenger continues to invite them to 
the Truth, as He does not deprive them of the opportunity of reforming 
themselves by sending down a scourge before the expiry of the term. The second 
reason is that Allah does not send down a scourge on an habitation as long as 
there remain in it any people, who tray ask His forgiveness for their past 
negligences and deviations and mend their ways. However, a scourge is sent down 
on the habitation when the Messenger considers that he has done all he could to 
admonish its people and emigrates from it or is expelled from it or is murdered 
by its people. This is because that habitation proves practically that it cannot 
tolerate in it even the presence of any good element.<br><br>28They have been 
further warned to this effect: "Now that you have incurred a torment, you should 
be ready for it for nothing will save you now from it" . The Quraish were under 
the delusion that they would not be visited by any torment because they were the 
guardians and keepers of the House of God. This misunderstanding has been 
removed by declaring, so to say, "They arc not its lawful guardians for mere 
inheritance does not entitle them to its guardianship. The pious people alone 
are the rightful guardians of this Sacred Place. The people of the Quraish have 
forfeited that right now if they had any right to it, because they were barring 
the way of the really pious people to this House, which is dedicated to the 
exclusive worship of Allah. The Quraish were behaving not as the guardians and 
keepers and servants of the House but as its masters, and prevented anyone they 
liked from visiting it. As regards their worship in the House, it was nothing 
more than making meaningless noises by whistling and clapping of hands: it was 
void of devotion towards Allah and of His remembrance and of all its 
requirements. How could they, then, expect any favor from Allah or any guarantee 
of immunity from His scourge?" <br><br>29They have been told that the scourge of 
Allah had visited them in thy shape of utter defeat in the Battle of Badr, which 
had given life to the Islamic Way and brought death to their way of 'ignorance'. 
This was necessary to remove their wrong notion that the scourge of Allah came 
only in the shape of rain or storm from the heavens or the like.<br><br>30"They 
have become bankrupt", for all their efforts, abilities, time and wealth 
ultimately proved to be absolutely worthless. It not only failed to earn any 
interest or profit for them but has also driven them to utter ruin.<br><br>
31Here the war aim of Islam, which had previously been declared in 11: 193, has 
been repeated. This aim has two aspects-- the negative and the positive. On the 
negative side, the aim of war is to abolish (fitnah), and on the positive, it is 
to establish Allah's Way completely and in its entirety. This is the only 
objective for which it is lawful, nay, obligatory for the believers to fight. 
There is no other object for which fighting is lawful, and it does not behoove 
the believers to resort to fighting for any other objective. (For fuller 
details, please see E.N.'s 204 and 205 of Al-Baqarah.) <br><br>32This verse 
contains the answer to the question which) was asked about the division of 
spoils at the very beginning of the Surah. There it was merely said that 'these 
are the bounties of Allah and belong to Him and His Messenger, and the authority 
to divide these belongs to them. `In this verse, the verdict on the spoils has 
been given. After the battle is over, the fighters should bring all the spoils 
to the leader and hide nothing of these. Then one-fifth should be set apart for 
the requirements stated in this verse, and the remaining four-fifths divided 
among those who took part in the fighting. That is why the Holy Prophet used to 
announce after every fight, "These spoils belong to you, and I have no share in 
these for my own person except one-fifth only and that, too, is spent for your 
common good. Therefore bring here everything-even a needle and its thread. Do 
not hide anything, big or small, for this is a shameful thing and leads to Hell" 
.<br><br>This one-fifth share of Allah and His Messenger has been reserved for 
the cause of Allah and for the establishment of His Way.<br><br>During his 
life-time, by the relatives were meant the relatives of the Holy Prophet. A 
share from the one-fifth of the spoils was to be given to those relatives of the 
Holy Prophet who wen dependent on him for now he had to devote the whole of his 
time to the cause of Allah's religion and it was not possible for him to earn 
for the maintenance of the members of his own family and of the relatives who 
were dependent on him. But there has been a difference of opinion regarding this 
share of the relatives after his death. Some are of the opinion that this share 
was abolished after the death of the Holy Prophet; others say that this share 
should go to the relatives of his successor. But there arc still others who hold 
that this share should be spent for the needy persons from among his offspring. 
According to my research, this share was given to the needy ones of his 
offspring during the time of his rightly guided successors. <br><br>33"What We 
sent down on Our servant" means His timely succor that brought about the victory 
in the Battle of Badr.<br><br>34That is, "It should be proved that whichever 
(Islam or ignorance) survived in the Battle, really deserved to live, and 
whichever perished, ought to have perished" . It should be noted that here the 
conflict for survival was not between different persons as such but between 
Islam and ignorance' as represented by the Believers and the disbelievers. <br>
<br>35As Allah hears everything and sees everything and knows everything, He is 
running His universe with wisdom and justice and will allow the right alone to 
survive.<br><br>36This happened when the Holy Prophet was marching from Al 
Madinah towards the battlefield and it was not then known how large the army of 
the disbelievers was. In this dream, he saw the army and concluded from what he 
saw that it was not large. He related what he saw in his dream to the Muslims, 
and this filled them with courage and they marched on boldly towards the enemy.<br>
<br>37As the Arabic word (sabr) which has been translated into fortitude is very 
comprehensive in meaning, 'practice fortitude' implies: "Keep your feelings and 
passions under control; avoid rashness, bewilderment, despair, and greediness: 
keep cool and calm and make considered decisions; remain firm and steadfast in 
the face of dangers and difficulties; don't take any wrong step even under the 
greatest provocations; don't lose your senses even when you are attacked by 
afflictions and are in a sad plight; don't take any hasty action in your 
impatience to achieve your objective without delay with the help of some seeming 
effective device and don't be enticed by the temptation of some worldly interest 
or gain or lust" . Allah helps those who practice fortitude (sabr) in accordance 
with the above implications. <br><br>38The Muslims have been forewarned never to 
behave like the disbelievers of Makkah, who had marched arrogantly out of their 
homes and who were debarring the Muslims from the Way of Allah. They had singing 
girls with them and they held singing, dancing and drinking parties at many 
halting places. Moreover, they made a great display of their power, grandeur, 
numerical strength and equipment before the clans and habitations which came in 
their way and freely bragged that none could have the courage to fight with 
them. This was the state of their morality but the objective for which they were 
marching out was even worse than this. They had not marched out to raise the 
standard of truth, righteousness and justice, but to prevent it from rising up. 
Their objective was to annihilate the only people who were exerting to raise up 
that standard. This bad example was held out before the Muslims so that they 
should guard against such behavior for their Faith required that their conduct 
should be righteous and their war aim should be pure and noble.<br><br>It may 
also be noted that this guidance was not needed only at that time but it is 
equally needed even today and will be needed in future as well, for the moral 
condition of the armies of the modern `civilized' nations is the same as of the 
disbelievers of Makkah. Prostitutes indecent recreations and wine constitute 
their essential parts, and they do not ask for these things secretly but openly 
and brazen-facedly. More than that! their soldiers openly demand from their own 
people that they should present their own daughters to them for the 
gratification of their lusts. How can, then, any other people expect from them 
that they would spare their women and will not make them the plaything of their 
passions? As regards their arrogance, suffice it to say that each and every 
soldier and officer of their army is an embodiment of pride and vanity. Then 
their politicians are never tired of bragging like this: 'None is able to defeat 
us today for none is more powerful than we". And their war aims are still more 
wicked. Whereas everyone of their leaders most solemnly and cunningly assure the 
world that they have nothing but the good of humanity before them, they might 
have, in fact, all other aims but this. They wage war in order to capture all 
the resources of the earth that God has created for all mankind, and to 
monopolize these for the benefit of their own country and nation, and make all 
other people their servants and dependents. That is why the Qur'an forbids the 
Muslims to follow the evil ways of those wicked people and enjoins them to 
refrain from expending their wealth and life for the achievement of the 
objective for which the wicked people fight.<br><br>39This was the opinion of 
the hypocrites and the worldly-wise people of Al-Madinah. When they saw that the 
small band of Muslims was going to fight with the large and superior force of 
the Quraish they said to one another, "Over enthusiasm for their religion has 
made these people mad and they are going to meet with utter destruction. As they 
have been blinded by their Prophet, they cannot see that they are going into the 
very mouth of death" . <br><br>40That is, "Allah does not withdraw His favor 
from any people until they themselves prove by their conduct that they have 
become unworthy of it".<br><br>41"Those ..... who violate the treaties....." 
were the Jews. On his migration to AI-Madinah, they were the first people with 
whom the Holy Prophet had entered into an alliance to co-operate for mutual 
good. He did his very best to establish good relations with them, for he 
considered them to be nearer to Islam than the mushriks, and he preferred their 
way to those of the mushriks, whenever a choice had to be made between the two. 
But their scholars and rabbis did not at all like the pure doctrine of Tauhid, 
taught by him, and the high standard of morality presented by him, and the 
exertions put in by him for the establishment of the Right Way. Therefore, in 
spite of the treaties they were persistently trying to defeat the New Movement. 
Accordingly, they adopted several measures: they conspired with the hypocrites 
of AI-Madinah against the true Muslims: they incited the clans of Aus and 
Khazraj against each other in order to kindle the fire of the old enmity that 
existed between the two before the advent of Islam and had led to bloody feuds, 
and they contrived plots with the Quraish and other hostile clans to ruin the 
Muslims. Though the Jews had all along been violating the written treaty the 
Holy Prophet had made with them, their enmity and jealousy had become even more 
furious than before, after the victory at Badr. For they had expected that the 
Movement would receive a crushing blow at the hands of the Quraish, but the 
result had been quite the reverse of it. Therefore they increased their inimical 
activities all the more in order to prevent Islam from becoming a formidable 
force. So much so that on hearing the news of the defeat of the Quraish, one of 
their leaders, Ka`ab bin Ashraf, cried out in anguish, "Today the bowels of the 
earth are far better for us than its surface". Accordingly, he himself went to 
Makkah and recited exciting elegies to incite the people of Quraish to wreak 
their vengeance. More than that: the people of one of their clans, Bani Qainqa 
`, setting aside the good neighborly manners, began to tease the Muslim women 
who used to go to their habitations for business. When the Holy Prophet reproved 
them, they gave an impudent reply and said, "We are not weak like the Quraish: 
we are a people who know how to fight even to the death: you will have an 
experience of our courage when you encounter us. " <br><br>42That is, "If we 
'have made a treaty with a certain people and they disregard its obligations and 
take part in a fight against us we shall also be absolved from the obligations 
of the treaty and fight against them. Likewise if we are fighting against any 
people and find any of our allies among the enemies we should not hesitate to 
kill them and treat them as enemies. For by discarding the obligations of the 
alliance as individuals, they forfeit all the rights of an ally in regard to the 
security of life and property."<br><br>43This verse lays down a very clear and 
strict rule for the breaking of a treaty when necessary, and enjoins the Muslims 
to "throw their treaty openly before them" . According to this verse, it is 
unlawful to make a unilateral decision of its termination, even if the Muslims 
felt that the other party with whom they had entered into an alliance, was not 
observing the treaty strictly and properly, or if they were afraid that the 
other party would turn treacherous on the first opportunity. Therefore it 
forbids them to treat the other party in a way as if there had been no treaty 
with it at all. On the other hand, this verse binds the Muslims to inform the 
other party in clear words, before taking any step against it, that the treaty 
with it had been terminated. This is essential so that the other party should 
have no misunderstanding whatsoever that the treaty was still in force. The Holy 
Prophet based the international policy of Islam on this verse. He decreed, "The 
one that has made a treaty with another party is bound by it until the expiry of 
its teen. Or if obliged, then one should throw it before the other party so that 
both may be set on equal footing" . Then he extended the same principle to all 
other affairs, saying, "Behave not treacherously even towards those who are 
treacherous to you" . And he had impressed the same so deeply on the minds that 
this principle was observed most strictly both in letter and in spirit. That is 
why when Amir Mu'aviyah assembled his army near the frontiers of the Roman 
Empire with the intention that he would invade their territory immediately after 
the expiry of the term of the treaty, Hadrat Amar bin `Anbasah, a Companion of 
the Holy Prophet, strongly protested against this and recited the same Tradition 
before him according to which even concentration of army was a piece of 
treachery. The Amir had to submit to this, and he gave up the concentration of 
army.<br><br>It may also be noted that the practice of unilateral abrogation of 
treaties `and invading the enemy without any declaration of war was common 
during the time of `ignorance' in the ancient times and is also in vogue in the 
civilized ignorance: of today. For example, during World War' II, Germany 
invaded Russia, and Britain and Russia took military action against Iran without 
any formal declaration of war. It may be noted that the pleas put forward for 
such breaches and violations are very flimsy: it is argued that if a declaration 
of war had been made beforehand, the other party would have taken precautionary 
measures and given a tough fight; or that if they had not taken action, their 
enemy would have forestalled them. But they seem to forget that if moral 
responsibilities were to be set aside on such lame excuses, then there remains 
no crime and no sin that cannot be justified on one plea or the other, and every 
thief, every robber; every adulterer, every murderer and every forgerer can put 
forward a justification for his crime or sin. But it is strange that the modem 
leaders have two standards of judgment. While they justify the acts of treachery 
in the international sphere, they condemn the same when these are committed in 
their own national sphere.<br><br>There is, however, an exception to the above 
principle. The Islamic Law allows the Muslims to attack the other party, if it 
violates the treaty openly and takes some specific inimical action against them. 
In such a clear case, this verse does not bind them to give a due notice of the 
termination of the treaty, but grants them the right to take military action 
against such a treacherous party without giving any ultimatum. The Muslim 
jurists have deduced this exception from a precedent set by the Holy Prophet. 
When the Quraish openly broke the treaty of Hudaibiyah, in regard to Bani 
Khuza`ah, he did not consider it obligatory to give them a notice that he, too, 
had terminated the same. He, therefore, invaded Makkah without giving them any 
notice. But here we must strike a note of warning. In order to take advantage of 
this exception, we must consider all the circumstances under which the Holy 
Prophet thought it right to invade Makkah. In that case, and in that alone, it 
is lawful for us to follow the precedent set by him; otherwise we are liable to 
take undue advantage of it. We learn from the books of Hadith and Sirat that the 
following circumstances led him to take this step:<br><br>(1) The violation of 
the treaty by the Quraish was so glaring that there was absolutely no doubt that 
there had been a breach and they themselves confessed that the treaty had come 
to an end. That is why they sent Abu Sufyan to AI-Madinah for its renewal. 
Though that was a proof that they also knew that the treaty had come to an end, 
it does not mean that this exception will be justifiable only if those who 
violate the treaty also know it and confess it. The exception will be only 
justifiable if the violation would be quite clear and beyond any doubt.<br><br>
(2) After the violation of the treaty, the Holy Prophet did not indicate in any 
way whatever by word or by deed or by implication- that in spite of the 
violation of the treaty by them he regarded the treaty to be still in force; nor 
did he continue such relations with them as might indicate the same. All the 
traditions show that he rejected the offer of the renewal of the treaty made by 
Abu Sufyan.<br><br>(3) He openly took the military action against the Quraish 
and did nothing at all to show an outward display of peace while harboring 
secret intentions of war.<br><br>This is the excellent precedent set by the Holy 
Prophet in this matter. An exception to the injunction contained in this verse 
can, therefore, be made under such specific circumstances that existed on the 
occasion, and that, too, in the same straightforward noble way.<br><br>Besides, 
it is lawful for the Muslims to use force for the settlement of an issue if and 
when they find that the other party is neither willing to solve it by mutual 
talk nor by international arbitration, but is bent upon using force. In such a 
case, this verse makes it incumbent on the Muslims to make a clear and open 
declaration to this effect before taking any action. Islam considers a secret 
military action as immoral and does not allow it, if the Muslims are not 
prepared to make an open declaration of war.<br><br>44This means, "You should 
always keep in readiness the necessary military equipment and an organized 
standing army so that you may be able to take military action immediately 
without the least delay, should the enemy attack you suddenly. These 
precautionary measures should be taken so that there should be no confusion and 
no hurry to urge you to enlist half-trained and ill-equipped volunteers; nor 
would there be any fear that the enemy would take you unawares and inflict 
irreparable losses on you before you could get ready for the defense".<br><br>
45That is, "Your relations with other nations should be based on your trust in 
God for `He is sufficient for you'. Therefore you should boldly face the enemy 
both in war and in peace. When the enemy desires to have a talk with you for 
peace, you should be willing and ready to negotiate with the other party without 
any hesitation. Do not reject the offer on the pica that the other party is not 
sincere and has treacherous intentions. for no one can have correct knowledge of 
the intentions of others: If the other party is sincere in its offer, then it 
will be wrong to reject it and continue the bloodshed. And if the enemy has 
treacherous intentions, then Allah will protect you from them because of your 
courage and moral superiority. In that case, fight bravely with the treacherous 
enemy so as to teach them such a lesson as may prove a deterrent". <br><br>
46This refers to the blessing of Islam which led to the union of the hearts of 
the different Arab clans and integrated them into a strong community, although 
before this there had been permanent enmities between them for centuries. This 
favor of God had been very conspicuous in the case of Aus and Khazraj clans of 
Al-Madinah. These two clans had been mortal enemies, and the bloody war of 
Bu'ath had taken place between them only two years before this. It was really a 
miracle that such enmities had been changed into such a union as was witnessed 
by the Islamic Community during the time of the Holy Prophet. It was quite 
obvious that this thing could not have been accomplished through any human 
powers or resources, for whatever had been accomplished, it had been 
accomplished by His grace and whatever will be accomplished, it will be 
accomplished by His grace.<br><br>47Here the word "understanding" has been used 
in the same sense as `morale' is used now-a-days. Understanding is a better 
scientific term than morale-the moral and mental condition which enables persons 
to keep up courage and enthusiasm, etc. For it is obvious that the one, who 
understands clearly the objective for which he is fighting would realize that it 
is more precious than his own life which would be meaningless if that object was 
lost, will possess a fighting power far greater than of the one who has no clear 
understanding of the object for which he is fighting, even though the two may be 
equal in their physical powers. Above all, the one who has the right 
understanding of the Reality, of the existence of Allah, of his own position in 
the universe, of his relation with Allah, of the life and death in this world, 
of the life in the Next World, of the distinction between Truth and falsehood, 
of the consequences of the victory of falsehood over Truth, has much more power 
even than those who fight for their country, their nation or for the sake of a 
class, even if the latter had the right understanding of their cause. Thus it is 
clear that the power of the Believers, who have full understanding of their 
object, is ten times that of disbelievers of the same capability. But along with 
this understanding, the practice of fortitude is also essential for gaining and 
maintaining that power. <br><br>48This reduction of the ratio of the power of a 
Muslim to that of a nonMuslim from ten to one, to two to one does not mean that 
this was due to sane deterioration in the morale of the Muslims. It simply means 
that in v. 65 the general principle of the ratio of the power of the Believers 
and the disbelievers was enunciated and in v. 66 that principle was applied in 
accordance with the then existing condition of their morale. At that time (A.H. 
2) the morale of the Muslims had not attained perfection, for many of them had 
only recently entered the fold of Islam and were still under preliminary 
training. Afterwards when their morale reached the desired standard under the 
guidance of the Holy Prophet, the ratio of ten to one was actually established, 
and was demonstrated practically in the battles during his last years and during 
the time of his rightly-guided successors. <br><br>49As regards the question why 
Allah rebuked the Muslims in v. 68 for taking ransom, the commentators have 
cited some traditions. According to these, after the Battle of Badr, a 
consultation was held in regard to the prisoners taken from the army of the 
Quraish. Hardrat Abu Bakr was of the opinion that they should be set at liberty 
after the payment of ransom but Hadrat `Umar opined that they should be slain. 
The Holy Prophet agreed to the opinion of Hadrat Abu Bakr and set them at 
liberty after the payment of their ransom. At this, Allah sent down this verse 
as a rebuke. But this interpretation is open to some objections.<br><br>The 
first difficulty of these interpreters is that they are unable to give a 
satisfactory explanation that might fit into the words: "Had there not been a 
decree that had already been given by Allah....". They say that it refers to the 
decree that was predestined by Allah or it means that Allah had already decreed 
to snake spoils of war lawful though He had not sent down this decree to the 
Holy Prophet. But it is obvious that a thing does not become lawful unless it is 
made so by an explicit Command. The second difficulty is that according to this 
explanation, the Holy Prophet himself and his followers become guilty of the sin 
of taking ransom for prisoners. Therefore one would think many times before 
accepting an explanation that is based on traditions emanating from a single 
source.<br><br>In my opinion, Allah rebuked the Muslims for not complying fully 
with the condition laid down in the Ordinance in XLVII: 4: "So kill the 
disbelievers until you crush them down; after this you may take them as 
prisoners; and then set them at liberty as a favor or for a ransom after the 
battle comes to an end. According to this previous Ordinance, there was nothing 
wrong in taking prisoners of war and charging ransom for them, but what was 
wrong was that they did not fully comply with the prior condition, that is, 
`until you crush them down' . For we learn that, when after the Battle of Badr 
the army of the Quraish was put to rout, many Muslims began to gather spoils or 
to take prisoners and only a few of them went in pursuit of the enemy to crush 
them. Had all the Muslims gone in pursuit of them, they would have crushed down 
their power then and there. Therefore Allah rebuked the Muslims (and not the 
Holy Prophet) as if to say, "O Muslims ! you have not yet fully understood the 
meaning of the mission of the Prophet. He is not sent to take prisoners and 
charge ransoms or gather spoils. The main objective of his mission is to crush 
down the powers of disbelief. But you are overwhelmed by the worldly Breeds 
again and again. During the course of this campaign, you at first desired to 
attack the trade caravan instead of the army of the Quraish. Then you began to 
gather spoils and take prisoners, and afterwards entered into a dispute 
regarding the division of spoils. Had We not previously given you permission for 
taking ransom (XLVII :4), We would have inflicted a severe chastisement on you. 
Very well, now you may enjoy what you have taken, but you should, in future, 
fear Us and refrain from incurring Our displeasure.<br><br>Imam Jassas also is 
of the same opinion (as expressed in his book Ahkamul-Qur an), and therefore the 
above interpretation is worth considering. This view is also supported by a 
Tradition related in Sirat-i-Ibn Hisham. According to this, the Holy Prophet 
noticed signs of disapproval on the face of Sa`ad bin M'uaz on the occasion, 
when the Muslims were gathering the spoils and taking prisoners. So the Holy 
Prophet said, "O Sa`ad, it appears that you do not approve this conduct of the 
Muslims". Sa`ad replied, "It is so, O Messenger of Allah. This is the first 
victory that Allah has given us over the mushriks. Therefore it would have been 
much better for us to crush down their power completely than to save their lives 
by taking them prisoners" . (Volume II, pp. 280-281).<br><br>50This verse 
contains a very important article of the Islamic Constitution . and lays down 
the terms of the relationship (vilayat-guardianship) between the Muslims. 
According to it, "Those Muslims only shall be bound by the relationship of 
vilayat who are either the inhabitants of Dar-ul-Islam or emigrate to it. As for 
the Muslims living outside the territorial borders of the Islamic State, there 
shall be the relationship of Islamic brotherhood only, but there shall be no 
relationship of vilayat with them. Likewise there shall be no relationship of 
vilayat with those Muslims who visit the Dar-ul-Islam as foreigners in the 
capacity of the subjects of Dar-ul-Kufr, without emigrating to it permanently"<br>
<br>The Arabic word ( vilayat) is very comprehensive in meaning and 
'guardianship' does not convey its full significance. It denotes the 
relationship of help, succor, protection, support, friendship, guardianship and 
the like between the citizens and the State and vice versa, and between the 
citizens themselves. Thus it is clear that this verse confines the limits of the 
Islamic, political and constitutional citizenship to its territorial boundaries 
only and excludes from this particular relationship the other Muslims who live 
beyond its territorial boundaries.<br><br>The legal implications of this 
negation of guardianship are very extensive, but this is not the occasion for 
their statement. Here it will suffice to say that according to this, the Muslims 
of Dar-ul-Kufr cannot become the inheritors of the Muslims of Dar-ul-Islam and 
vice versa, nor can they be the legal guardians of one another, nor can there be 
inter-marriages between them; nor can the Islamic State appoint a citizen of 
Dar-ul-Kufr on any responsible post, until that one renounces the relationship 
of citizenship with Dar-ul-Kufr. Moreover, this verse affects also the foreign 
policy of the Islamic State and frees it from the responsibility of the Muslims 
living outside its territorial borders by restricting it only to the Muslims 
living within its territory. The Holy Prophet also declared the same thing, 
saying, "I owe no responsibility for the protection of any Muslim who resides 
among the mushriks"<br><br>This foreign policy of Islam cuts at the very roots 
of such disputes as are generally responsible for creating international crises. 
For it is obvious that if states refuse to shoulder any responsibilities for the 
protection, etc., of the minorities living outside their territorial borders, 
there cannot arise such disputes concerning them as lead to wars over and over 
again. <br><br>51Though the Muslims living outside the territorial borders of 
the Islamic State have been excluded from political protection in the preceding 
verse, this fact does not deprive them of the brotherly relationship of Faith. 
Therefore it is obligatory on the Islamic State and its inhabitants, to help 
their wronged and oppressed brethren if they ask for help. But even in this 
case, they should observe the International Law and the universally accepted 
moral code. If Dar-ul-Islam has made a treaty with the persecuting people of 
Dar-ul-Kufr the Muslims of Dar-ul-Islam are forbidden to give any help to the 
oppressed Muslims in Dar-ul-Kufr if that is against the moral obligations of the 
treaty.<br><br>In this verse the word (mithaq) has been used for treaty. It 
implies everything that gives the guarantee of peace in the known sense to the 
parties concerned even though there might not be any explicit mention of a 
no-war agreement. <br>Moreover, the original words of the Arabic Text- 
"....between you and thetas there is a treaty"- clearly show that a treaty of 
the Islamic State with a non-Islamic State is not merely a treaty between the 
two states but between the two nations. Therefore it is morally binding on both 
the Islamic State and the Muslims living in the Islamic State. The Islamic Code 
does not tolerate that the Muslim subjects should be left free from the 
obligations of the treaty which a Muslim government makes with other countries 
or nations. Of course, those Muslims who reside outside the territorial borders 
of the State that makes a treaty are free from this obligation. that is why Abu 
Busair, Abu Jandal and other Muslims who were not the subjects of Dar-ul-Islam 
were not bound by the terms of the Treaty of Hudaibiyah, which the Holy Prophet 
had made with the disbelievers of Makkah. <br><br>52The sentence-"unless you 
also help one another"-has two meanings: (1) If it is considered in connection 
with the previous sentence, "the disbelievers help one another," it means: "If 
you, the Believers, will not help one another just as the disbelievers help one 
another, there will be mischief and great disorder on the earth" . (2) But if it 
is considered in connection with the instructions given in v. 72, it will mean: 
if the people living in Dar-ul- Islam (a) do not become the guardians and 
protectors of one another, (b) do not consider the Muslims, who have not 
migrated to Dar-ul-Islam and live in Dar-ul-Kufr, outside their political 
protection, (c) do not. give help to the persecuted Muslims, living outside 
Dar-ul-Islam, when they ask for it, and if at the same time, they do not observe 
the law that the Muslims living in Dar-ul-Islam would not help those Muslims 
living in Dar-ul-Kufr among the people with whom they made a treaty of peace, 
and (d) do not break all their friendly relations with the disbelievers,-then 
there will be mischief and great chaos in the world.<br><br>53This is to remove 
a misunderstanding. After migration to AI-Madinah, the Holy Prophet had 
established the relationship of brotherhood between the Muhajirin and the Ansar, 
which gave rise to the misunderstanding that they had become the inheritors of 
one another. This verse says that inheritance shall be determined by the 
blood-relationship and not by the relationship of brotherhood in the Faith. </p>
