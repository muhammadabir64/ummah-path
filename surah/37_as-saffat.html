                      <p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>The name is derived from the word was saaffat 
with which the Surah begins.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br>
<br>The subject matter and the style show that this Surah probably was sent down 
in the middle of the Makkan period, or perhaps in the last stage of the middle 
Makkan period. The style clearly indicates that antagonism is raging strong in 
the background and the Holy Prophet and his Companions are passing through very 
difficult and discouraging circumstances.<br><br><strong>Subject Matter and 
Theme</strong><br><br>The disbelievers of Makkah have been severely warned for 
their attitude of mockery and derision with which they were responding to the 
Holy Prophet's message of Tauhid and the Hereafter and for their utter refusal 
to accept and acknowledge his claim to Prophethood. In the end, they have been 
plainly warned that the Prophet whom they are mocking and ridiculing will 
overwhelm them in spite of their power and self and they will find the army of 
Allah encamping in the very courtyards of their houses (vv. 171-179. This notice 
was given at a time when there appeared no chance whatever of the Holy Prophet's 
success and triumph. The Muslims (who have been called Allah's army in these 
verses) were being made the target of severe persecution. Three- fourth of their 
population had already emigrated and hardly 40 to 50 of the Companions were left 
with the Holy Prophet in Makkah who were experiencing all sorts of the excesses 
with utter helplessness. Under such circumstances, in view of the apparent 
conditions, no one could believe that the Holy Prophet and the handful of his 
ill equipped Companions would ultimately attain dominance. The people rather 
thought that the new movement would end and be buried in the ravines of Makkah. 
But hardly 15 to 16 years had passed when on the conquest of Makkah precisely 
the same thing happened of which the disbelievers had been forewarned.<br><br>
Along with administering warnings, Allah in this Surah has done full justice 
also to the theme of inducement and instruction in a balanced way. Brief but 
impressive arguments have been given about the validity of the doctrines of 
Tauhid and the Hereafter. Criticism has been made of the creed of the mushrikin 
to show the absurdity of their beliefs; they have been informed of the evil 
consequences of their deviations, which have been contrasted with the splendid 
results of the faith and righteous acts. Then, in continuation of the same, 
Precedents from past history have been cited to show how Allah had been treating 
His Prophets and their followers : how He has been favoring His faithful 
servants and punishing their deniers and rejectors.<br><br>The most instructive 
of the historical narratives presented in this Surah is the important event of 
the pious life of the Prophet Abraham, who became ready to sacrifice his only 
son as soon as he received an inspiration from Allah. In this there was a lesson 
not only for the disbelieving Quraish, who waxed proud of their blood 
relationship with him, but also for the Muslims who had believed in Allah and 
His Messenger. By narrating this event they were told what is the essence and 
the real spirit of Islam, and how a true believer should be ready to sacrifice 
his all for the pleasure and approval of Allah after he has adopted it as his 
Faith and Creed.<br><br>The last verses of the Surah were not only a warning for 
the disbelievers but also a good news for the believers who were passing through 
highly unfavorable and discouraging conditions on account of their supporting 
and following the Holy Prophet. In these verses they were given the good news 
that they should not be disheartened at the hardships and difficulties they had 
to encounter in the beginning, for in the end they alone would attain dominance, 
and the standard bearers of falsehood, who appeared to be dominant at the time 
would be overwhelmed and vanquished at their hands. A few years later the turn 
the events took, proved that it was not an empty consolation but an inevitable 
reality of which they had been foretold in order to strengthen their hearts.</p>

<p>The majority of the commentators are agreed that All these three groups imply 
the groups of the angels, and the same explanation of it has been reported from 
'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, Masruq Said bin Jubair, 'Ikrimah, 
Mujahid, Suddi, Ibn Zaid and Rabi' bin Anas. Some commentators have given other 
commentaries also, but this commentary is more in keeping with the context. The 
words "range themselves in ranks" refer to the fact that all the angels who arc 
administering the affairs of the universe, are the humble servants of Allah, and 
are ever ready to carry out any service and implement any command of His. This 
theme -has been further repeated in verse 165 below, where the angels say with 
regard to themselves: "We are the ranged servants (of Allah).'<br><br>As for 
"scolding and cursing", some commentators think that it refers to those angels 
who drive the clouds and arrange the rainfall. Although this meaning is not 
incorrect either, the meaning which is more relevant to the following context is 
that among these angels there is also a group of those, who scold and curse the 
disobedient people and the culprits, and this scolding and cursing is not merely 
verbal but it rains on human beings in the form of natural disasters and 
calamities.<br><br>"To recite admonition" implies that among these angels there 
are also those, who perform the service of admonition in order to draw the 
people's attention .to the Truth. This they do by bringing about natural 
calamities from which the needful take heed, and by bringing down the teachings 
to the Prophets, and in the form of revelations with which the pious men are 
blessed through them. <br><br>2This is the Truth to impress which an oath has 
been taken by the angels bearing the above-mentioned qualities. In other words, 
what is meant to be said is: "The whole system of the universe which is 
functioning in the service of Allah, and all those manifestations of this 
universe which bring the evil consequences of deviation from the service of 
Allah before men, testify that the "Deity" of men is One and only One."<br><br>
The word "Ilah" applies to two meanings:<br><br>(1) The deity who is actually 
being served and worshiped; and<br><br>(2) the Deity Who, in reality, is worthy 
of being served and worshiped.<br><br>Here, the word "Ilah"has been used in the 
second meaning, for, as far as the first meaning is concerned, men have adopted 
many other deities. That is why we have translated "Ilah"as the "real Deity".
<br><br>3The Truth that has been conveyed in these verses is: "The Master and 
Ruler of the Universe is the real Deity of men: He alone can be, and should be 
the Deity. It would be utterly irrational that the Rabb (i.e.. Master, Ruler, 
Guardian and Sustainer) of the man should be one but his Ilah (deity) another. 
The basic reason for worship is that man should naturally bow down before and 
acknowledge the superiority of him who can bring him harm and good, who can 
fulfill his needs and requirements, who can make or mar his destiny and has 
power over his life and survival itself. If man understands this he will 
automatically understand that to worship the one who has no power and not to 
worship Him Who has All the powers arc both against reason and nature. The One 
Who alone is worthy of worship is He Who possesses the powers. As far as the 
powerless beings are concerned, they are neither worthy of worship, nor is it in 
any way profitable to worship and pray to them, for it is not in their power to 
take any action whatever on man's petitions and prayers. To bow before them 
humbly and to petition them would be as foolish and meaningless an act as to bow 
before and petition another one who has himself gone before a ruler to make 
obeisance and submit his petitions. <br><br>4The sun does not always rise at the 
same point but at a different point every day. Moreover, it does not rise at one 
and the same time for the whole world but rises at different times for the 
different parts of the earth. That is why the plural "Mashariq" (Easts) has been 
used to indicate the different points at which the sun rises according to the 
season of the year. The corresponding word “Magharib” (Wests) has not been used 
because Mashariq itself points to Magharib However, in Surah Al-Ma'arij, the 
word magharib also has been used along with mashariq: Rabb-al-mashariqi 
wal-magharib.<br><br>5"Lower heaven" : The nearer heaven which can be seen with 
the naked eye, without the help of a telescope. The worlds beyond which can be 
seen through the telescopes of different powers, and the worlds which have not 
so far been observed through any moans, are the distant heavens. In this 
connection, one should also note that "sama " is not something definite and 
determined, but man generally has been using this word and its other synonyms 
for the heavens since the earliest times. <br><br>6That is, "Heaven is not 
merely empty space so that anyone who likes may enter it, but it has been 
fortified strongly, and its different regions have been bounded by such strong 
barriers that it is impossible for any rebel satan to exceed them. Every star 
and planet in the universe has its own circle and sphere escaping from which is 
as difficult as entering it. With the naked eye one can only see empty space, 
but, in reality, there are countless regions in space which have been even more 
strongly fortified and protected than they could be by steel walls. One can 
imagine and estimate the strength of these barriers by the difficulties man is 
experiencing in the way of reaching the moon, which is our nearest neighbor in 
space. Similar difficulties prevent the other creation of the earth, the jinns, 
from ascending towards the heavens.<br><br>7To understand this one should keep 
in view the fact that in the time of the Holy Prophet, soothsaying was in great 
vogue in Arabia. The soothsayers used to make predictions, give news of the 
unseen, tell the whereabouts of the lost properties and articles, and the people 
used to visit them to know the events of their past and future lives. These 
soothsayers claimed that they had some jinns and satans under their control, who 
brought them all sorts of news. In this environment when the Holy Prophet was 
appointed to Prophethood, and he began to recite the verses of the Qur'an, which 
described the past history and contained news of the future, and also stated 
that an angel brought him these verses, his opponents immediately branded him a 
soothsayer and started telling others that, like the other soothsayers, he too 
was associated with a satan, who brought him news from the heavens, which he 
presented as revelations from Allah. To refute this accusation, Allah says: "The 
satans have no access to heaven. They have no power to hear the conversations of 
the angels and bring its news for others; if by chance a little of it enters the 
ear of a satan, and he tries to bring it down, he is followed by a flashing 
flame." In other words, it means: "The grand system of the universe, which is 
functioning under the agency of the angels has been firmly guarded and secured 
against every interference of the satans. Not to speak of interfering in it, 
they do not even have the power to obtain any kind of information about it. " 
(For further explanation, see AI-Hijr: 17-18 and the E.N's thereof). <br><br>
8This is an answer to the suspicions of the disbelievers of Makkah, which they 
presented about the Hereafter. They thought that the Hereafter was not possible, 
for it is impossible that the dead men should be recreated. In answer to it, 
Allah presents arguments for the possibility of the Hereafter and asks: "If you 
think that the recreation of the dead men is a very difficult task which We do 
not have the power to accomplish, do you think it is easy to create the earth 
and the heavens and the countless things that they contain? Why don't you use 
your common sense ? Do you think that God for Whom it was not at all difficult 
to create this great Universe and Who has created you in the first instance, 
will not have the power to create you once again ?" <br><br>9That is, "Man is 
not a difficult thing to make. He has been created from clay, and can again be 
created from the same clay." "Created man of sticky clay" means that the first 
man was created directly from the clay and then his race was perpetuated by 
means of the sperm-drop. It also means that every man has been 'created from the 
sticky clay, for the whole substance of man's body is obtained from the earth. 
The sperm-drop of which he is created, is a product of the food, and all the 
substances which make up his physical being, from the time he is conceived till 
his death, are also supplied by the food. The source of the food, whether animal 
flesh or vegetable, is ultimately the same earth which, in combination with 
water produces corn and vegetables and fruit to become food for man, and nourish 
the animals, which supply milk and flesh for the use of man.<br><br>Thus, the 
basis of the argument is: Man could not be living today if the earth and clay 
had not become the source of life for him. And if it is possible today to create 
life in it, as your own existence is a clear and definite pointer to this 
possibility, why should it be impossible to bring about your re-creation from 
the same earth tomorrow ? <br><br>10That is, "This person is talking of the 
world of magic in which the dead will rise, and will be produced before a court 
and sent to Heaven and Hell" or, it may also mean: "This person is talking like 
a madman. What he talks is a clear proof that somebody has worked magic on him; 
otherwise a sensible person could not talk such things.<br><br>11That is, "Allah 
can make of you whatever He likes. When He willed, you came into being 
forthwith; when He wills, you will die at one Command by Him; and then whenever 
He wills, His one Command will raise you back to lift. " <br><br>12That is, 
"When the time comes for this, it will not be difficult to reestablish the whole 
world. Just a single shout will be enough to make the people to wake up. Here, 
the word "shout" or "cry" is very meaningful. It depicts the Resurrection as 
though the people who had died since the beginning of the creation till the last 
Day, were lying asleep, and a sudden command to them to "wake up" will cause 
them to rise up all at once." <br><br>13It may be that this is said by the 
believers, or by the angels; or it may be, as it were, the common expression of 
the conditions prevailing in the plain of Resurrection or it may as well be 
another reaction of the people themselves. That is, they may be saying in their 
hearts. "In the world, you lived in a way as if no Day of Judgment would ever 
come. Now you have come to your doom! This is the same Day that you used to deny 
! " <br><br>14"The unjust people" does not only imply those who committed 
injustices in the world, but as a Qur'anic term Zalim implies every such person, 
who might have adopted the way of rebellion and disobedience against Allah. "<br>
<br>15The word "azwaj"in the original might also imply their wives, who were 
their associates in this rebellion, and also all those people who were 
rebellious and disobedient like them. Moreover it may also mean that the 
culprits of different categories will be gathered together in separate groups.
<br><br>16"Gods" here implies two kinds of the gods:<br><br>(1) Those men and 
satans who themselves desired that the people should worship them instead of 
Allah; and<br><br>(2) those idols and trees and stones, etc., which have 
actually been worshiped in the world.<br><br>The first kind of the gods will be 
included among the culprits themselves and will be led to Hell for punishment; 
the other kind of them will be thrown into Hell along with their worshipers so 
that they constantly feel ashamed of and continue to regret their follies. 
Besides, there is also a third kind of the gods, who have been worshiped in the 
world, but without their own consent and knowledge; they rather forbade the 
people to worship anyone but Allah, e.g. the angels, prophets and saints. 
Obviously, this kind of the gods will not be included among the gods who will be 
driven to Hell along with their worshipers. <br><br>17The first sentence will be 
addressed to the culprits, and the second to the common spectators, who will be 
watching the scene of the culprits' departure for Hell. This sentence itself 
tells of the general conditions at the time. It tells how the haughty and 
stubborn culprits of the world will be moving towards Hell meekly and without 
showing any resistance. Somewhere some kind will be seen being pushed about, and 
no one from among his courtiers will come forward to rescue "his majesty"; 
somewhere some conqueror of the world and some dictator will be moving away in 
humiliation and disgrace, and his brave army itself will deliver him for the 
punishment; somewhere some saint or some holy father will be seen being thrown 
into Hell, and no one of his disciples will bother to save him froth disgrace; 
somewhere some leader will be trudging helplessly towards Hell, and those who 
used to glorify and applaud him in the world, will turn away their eyes from 
him. So much so that the (over who was ever prepared to sacrifice everything for 
the beloved in the world, will feel least concerned to save him from his plight. 
By depicting this scene Allah wants to impress how the relationships of man with 
man, which are based on rebellion against Allah in the world, will break in the 
Hereafter, and how the pride of those who are involved in arrogance and conceit 
here, will be ruined. <br><br>18The word yamin in Arabic is used for several 
meanings. It may mean use of the force, or well-wishing, or swearing of an oath. 
Accordingly, the verse would mean:<br><br>(1) "You compelled us into following 
error and deviation"; or<br><br>(2) "you deceived us by posing as our 
well-wishers"; or<br><br>(3) "you swore oaths to satisfy us that what you were 
presenting was the very truth." <br><br>19For explanation, see E.N's 51, 52, 53 
of Surah Saba. <br><br>20That is, the followers as well as the guides, 
misleaders as well as the misled, All shall suffer the same torment. Neither 
will the followers' excuse be heeded that they did not go astray but had been 
led astray, nor the guides' excuse accepted that the people themselves were not 
desirous of following the right way. <br><br>21Confirmation of the Messengers 
has three meanings and all the three are implied here:<br><br>(1) That he had 
not opposed any former Messenger so that the believers of that Messenger could 
have a rational ground of prejudice against him; he had rather confirmed all the 
former Messengers sent by God;<br><br>(2) that he had not brought any new or 
novel thing, but he had presented the same that the former Messengers of God had 
been presenting from the very beginning; and<br><br>(3) that he truly fulfilled 
and corresponded to the predictions that the former Messengers had made 
concerning him. <br><br>22"A known provision" : A provision All of whose 
characteristics have been made known to them, which they are sure to receive, 
about which they have also the full satisfaction that they will continue to 
receive it for ever, and about which there is no apprehension that they may or 
may not get it at some time. <br><br>23In this there is a subtle allusion to 
this also that in Paradise food will be provided not to serve as food but for 
pleasure and delight. That is, the food there will not be meant to replenish the 
bodily deficiencies through diet, for no deficiency whatever will occur in the 
body in that eternal life, nor will man have appetite, for appetite is caused by 
the process of assimilation in the body, nor will the body demand food for its 
survival. That is why the word fawakih has been used for the different kinds of 
food in Paradise, which contains the sense of taste and pleasure more than that 
of nutrition. <br><br>24That is, `It will not be the kind of wine that is 
extracted from rotten fruit and corn in the world, but it will flow naturally 
from fountains like canals. In Surah Muhammad, the same thing has been described 
more clearly, thus: ........and canals will be flowing in it of wine which will 
be delightful for the drinkers." (v. 15) <br><br>25Here the word ka `s (cup) 
only has been used and there is no mention of the wine. But in Arabic the use of 
ka's always implies wine. The cup which contains milk or water, instead of wine, 
or is empty, is not called ka's. The word ka's is used for a cup only when it 
contains wine. <br><br>26Here it has not been mentioned as to who will take 
these cups of wine round to the dwellers of Paradise. This has been stated at 
other places: `And there will go round to them young boys, exclusively appointed 
for their service, who will be as lovely as well-guarded pearls." (At-Tur :24). 
`They will be attended by brisk-moving boys who will for ever remain boys. If 
you saw them, you would think they were pearls, scattered." (Ad-Dahr: 19). Then, 
its further details are found in the traditions related by Hadrat Anas and 
Hadrat Samurah bin Jundub from the Holy Prophet, according to which: `The 
children of the mushrikin will be attendants of the dwellers of Paradise." (Abu 
Da`ud Tayalisi, Tabarani, Bazzar). Though these traditions are weak as regards 
their links of transmitters, there are several other Ahadith which mean that 
children who died young, before attaining maturity, will go to Paradise. Ahadith 
also show that the children whose parents are blessed with Paradise, will live 
with them so as to be a comfort of the eyes for them. This leaves behind those 
children whose parents will not go to Paradise. Thus, with regard to them, it 
seems reasonable that they will be made the attendants of the dwellers of 
Paradise. (For a detailed discussion of this, see Fath ul-Bari and 'Umdat 
ul-Qari: Kitab ul-Jana'iz, Bab; Maqila fi aulad il -mushrikin; Rasa 
'il-o-Masa'il, vol. III, pp. 177-187). <br><br>27That is, the wide of Paradise 
will be free from both the evils which are found in the wine of the world. The 
wine of the world, first of All, afflicts man with its stink; then it embitters 
his taste, upsets his stomach, affects his mind and causes giddiness; then it 
affects the liver and spoils the health generally. Then, when the intoxication 
is gone, it leaves behind other ill-effects on the body. Its other evil is that 
man gets drunk with it, talks nonsense and brawls. This is how the wine affects 
man's mind and reason. Man suffers both these evil effects of the wine only for 
the sake of delight and pleasure. Allah says that the wine of Paradise will 
certainly afford and give full pleasure and delight, but it will be free from 
the kinds of the evils that go with the worldly wine. <br><br>28Probably these 
will be the girls who died before attaining the age of discretion in the world, 
and whose parents did not deserve to enter Paradise. This can be said on the 
basis of analogy that just as the boys similarly placed will be appointed for 
the service of the dwellers of Paradise, and they will ever remain hoes, so will 
the girls be made the houris and they will ever remain young and beautiful. The 
correct knowledge, however, is with Allah. <br><br>29"Restraining their looks": 
Restraining their looks from everyone except their husbands. <br><br>30The words 
of the Text actually mean this: "As if they were the hidden or well preserved 
eggs." The commentators have given different interpretations of these words, but 
the correct commentary is the one which Hadrat Umm Salamah has related from the 
Holy Prophet. She says that when she asked the meaning of this verse from the 
Holy Prophet, he said: "Their delicacy and elegance and tenderness will be like 
the thin skin which is there between the shell of the egg and its fleshy part." 
(Ibn Jarir). <br><br>31That is, "Were you also one of those credulous people who 
put their faith in an irrational and impossible thing like life-after-death ?"
<br><br>32This shows how powerful will be man's hearing, seeing and speaking 
powers in the Hereafter. Sitting in Paradise he bends his head a little and is 
able to see a person, who is undergoing torment thousands of miles away in Hell, 
without the agency of a television set. Then, they not only just see each other, 
but also commune with each other directly without the medium of the telephone or 
radio and they speak and hear each other over vast distances. <br><br>33The 
style clearly shows that while speaking to his friend in Hell, the dweller of 
Paradise suddenly starts talking to himself. He speaks these three sentences in 
a way as if he found himself in a state much better than that he ever expected 
and imagined for himself, and now being beside himself with wonder and joy he is 
engaged in a sort of soliloquy. In such a state the speaker does not speak to an 
addressee, nor the questions he asks are meant to find out something from 
somebody, but in this state the man's own feelings find expression through his 
tongue. The dweller of Paradise, while speaking to the dweller of Hell, suddenly 
starts feeling how he has been favored by good fortune: now there is neither 
death nor any torment: all troubles and distresses have come to an end and he 
has been blessed with immortality. Under this very feeling he exclaims: "Well 
arc we not to die any other than our first death ? Are we not to be punished?"
<br><br>34Zaqqum is a tree of the cactus species found in Tihamah. It is bitter 
in taste, obnoxious in smell and sheds a milk like juice when cut or broken. <br>
<br>35That is, "On hearing this the disbelievers get a new opportunity to taunt 
the Qur'an and mock the Holy Prophet. They ridicule it saying, `Listen another 
strange thing: a tree will grow in the blazing fire of Hell'!"<br><br>36Nobody 
should have the misunderstanding that since no one has seen the head of Satan, 
it was no use likening the buds of zaqqum to it. This is, in fact, an 
imaginative kind of the simile, and is employed in the literature of every 
language. For example, in order to give an idea of the rare beauty of a woman, 
it is said she is a fairy, and in order to describe her ugliness, it is said 
that she is a hag or a demon. Likewise, a pious-looking person is described as 
an angel and a dreadful-looking person as a devil. <br><br>37This shows that 
when the dwellers of Hell will be in distress due to hunger and thirst, they 
will be driven to the side where there would be the zaqqum trees and the springs 
of boiling water. When they will have eaten and drunk, they will be brought back 
to Hell. <br><br>38That is, they never used their own common sense to sec 
whether the way their forefathers had been following was right or wrong; they 
just blindly adopted the way that they found others following. <br><br>39This 
theme is related with the preceding sentences. A study of them shows why these 
stories are being narrated here. <br><br>40This refers to the prayer that the 
Prophet Noah had at last made to Allah Almighty, being disappointed with his 
people, after having preached the true Faith to them for a very long period of 
time, without much success. This prayer has been related in Surah All-Qamar, 
thus: "He called out to his Lord, saying: I am overcome: take now Thy 
vengeance." (v. 10). <br><br>41That is, from the severe distress that was being 
caused to him on account of the continuous opposition and antagonism of a wicked 
and cruel people. This also contains a subtle allusion that just as the Prophet 
Noah and his companions were saved from the great distress, so also shall We 
ultimately save the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) and his 
Companions from the great distress that is being caused to them by the people of 
Makkah. <br><br>42This can have two meanings:<br><br>(1) That the progeny of the 
people who were opposing the Prophet Noah was made extinct and the Prophet 
Noah's progeny alone was allowed to survive; and<br><br>(2) that the whole human 
race was made extinct, and only the Prophet Noah's progeny was allowed to 
inhabit the earth after that. The commentators generally have adopted this 
second meaning, but the words of the Qur'an are not explicit in this regard and 
no one knows the reality except Allah. <br><br>43That is there is none in the 
world today, who would talk coil of the Prophet Noah. After the Flood till today 
the world has been praising and speaking well of him for thousands of years. <br>
<br>44"Approached his Lord": Turned to his Lord sincerely and exclusively; "with 
a sound heart": with a heart that was free from all kinds of moral evils and 
weaknesses of faith, free from every trace of unbelief and shirk, doubt and 
suspicion, from every feeling of disobedience and rebellion, from every 
crookedness, confusion and complexity, and free from every evil inclination and 
desire, and a heart that neither cherished any malice and jealousy and ill-will 
against anyone, nor had any evil intention. <br><br>45For further details of 
this story of the Prophet Abraham, please see Surah Al-An'am: 72-90; Maryam: 
41-60; AI-Anbiya: 51-75; Ash-Shu'ara; 69-89; Al-'Ankabut: 16-17, and the E.N's 
thereof. <br><br>46That is, "Why have you formed such a wrong view of Allah? Do 
you think that the gods that you have yourselves carved out from wood and stone 
can be like Him, or can be His associates in his attributes and rights? And are 
you involved in the misunderstanding that you will somehow manage to escape His 
punishment after you have indulged in such blasphemy ?<br><br>47The reference is 
to a particular incident the details of which have been given in Surah 
Al-Anbiya': 71-73 and Al-`Ankabut: 16-27 above. <br><br>48Ibn Abi Hatim has 
cited a saying of the famous commentator Qatadah, an immediate follower of the 
Companions, to the effect that the Arabic idiomatic expression, cast a glance at 
the stars," means that he pondered deeply, or that he started thinking 
seriously. 'Allama Ibn Kathir has preferred this same view, and this is also 
supported by the common observation: when a person is confronted by a problem 
that needs serious consideration, he looks upward or to the sky for a while, and 
then makes a reply, after due consideration. <br><br>49This is one of those 
three things concerning which it is said that the Prophet Abraham had told three 
lies in his life, whereas it should be ascertained before declaring it a lie, or 
anything contrary to fact, whether the Prophet Abraham at that time was not 
suffering from any illness, and therefore, he had trade this excuse only as a 
pretense. If there is no proof, there is no reason why it should be regarded as 
a lie. For a detailed discussion, please refer to E.N. 60 of Surah Al-Anbiya` 
and Rasa 'il-o-Masa'il, vol. II, pp. 35 to 39. <br><br>50This sentence by itself 
shows the real state of the affairs. It appears that the people might be going 
to sane fair of theirs. The family of the Prophet Abraham might have asked him 
also to accompany them. He might have excused himself, saying that he was 
indisposed, and therefore, could not go. Had it been something contrary to fact, 
the people of the house would have said: "You look perfectly normal: you are 
making a false excuse. But when they accepted his excuse and left him behind, it 
clearly shows that the Prophet Abraham must at that time be suffering from cough 
and cold or sane other such visible illness on account of which the people of 
the house agreed to leave him behind. <br><br>51This shows that there were 
different kinds of food placed before the idols in the temple. <br><br>52Here 
the story has been told in brief. According to the details given in Surah 
Al-Anbiya`, when they returned and found all their idols broken to pieces in the 
temple, they started making investigations. Some people said that a young man, 
called Abraham, had been talking such and such things against idol-worship. At 
this the multitude demanded that he should be immediately seized and brought 
before them. Therefore, a group of the people went running to him and brought 
him before the multitude. <br><br>53The words in Surah Al-Anbiya`: 69 are to the 
effect: "We commanded: O fire, be cool and become safe for Abraham," and in 
Surah AI'Ankbut: 24, it has been said: "Then Allah saved him from the fire." 
This proves that those people had actually thrown the Prophet Abraham into the 
fire, and then Allah had rescued him from it safe and sound. The words of the 
verse, "They had designed a plan against him, but We defeated them in their 
plan," cannot be taken to mean that they had only intended to throw the Prophet 
Abraham into the fire but could not carry their plan into effect; but when these 
words are read with the verses cited above, the meaning becomes plain that they 
had wanted to kill him by casting him into the fire but could not do so, and the 
Prophet Abraham's miraculous escape proved his superiority and the polytheists 
were humbled by Allah. The real object of relating this incident is to warn the 
people of the Quraish to this effect: "The way that you have adopted is not the 
way of the Prophet Abraham, whose descendants you claim yourselves to be, but 
his way is the one being presented by the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's 
peace and blessings). Now, if you plot against him in order to defeat him and 
frustrate his mission, as the people of the Prophet Abraham had done against 
him, you alone will be defeated in the end, because you cannot defeat Muhammad 
(upon whom be Allah's peace). <br><br>54The Prophet Abraham said these words on 
his departure after he had been delivered safe from the fire and had decided to 
leave the country. <br><br>55It mean: "I am leaving my home and country for the 
sake of Allah, for my people have turned hostile to me only because of my 
turning to Him exclusively; otherwise there was no worldly dispute between them 
and me because of which I might have had to Leave my country. Moreover. I have 
no place of refuge in the world, to which I may turn. I am leaving my home with 
full faith and trust only in Allah: I shall go wherever He leads me. " <br><br>
56This prayer by itself shows that the Prophet Abraham at that time was 
childless. From the details given at other places in the Qur'an, it becomes 
clear that he had left his country with only one wife and one nephew (the 
Prophet Lot). Therefore, he naturally desired that Allah should bless him with a 
righteous child, who could be a source of comfort and consolation for him in a 
foreign land. <br><br>57From this one should not understand that this good news 
was given him immediately following his prayer. In the Qur'an itself, at another 
place, this saying of the Prophet Abraham has been related: "All praise be to 
Allah Who has given me sons like Ishmael and Isaac in my old age." (Ibrahim: 
39). This proves that there was an interval of many years between the prayer and 
this good news. The Bible says that at the birth of the Prophet Ishmael, the 
Prophet Abraham was 86 years old (Gen. 16: 16) and at the birth of the Prophet 
Isaac a hundred years. (Gen. 21: 5). <br><br>58One should note that the Prophet 
Abraham had dreamed that he was sacrificing his son and not that he had 
sacrificed him. Although at that time he understood the dream to mean that he 
should sacrifice his son and on that very basis, he became ready to sacrifice 
him, with a cool mind, yet the fine point that Allah had in view in making him 
see the dream has been explained by Himself in verse 105 below.<br><br>59The 
object of asking this of the son was not that he would carry out Allah's Command 
only if he agreed, otherwise not, but the Prophet Abraham, in fact, wanted to 
find out how righteous, in actual reality, was his child for whom he had prayed 
to Allah. If the son himself was found to be ready to lay down his life for the 
sake of Allah's approval and pleasure, it would mean that the prayer had been 
fully granted, and the son was not his offspring in the natural way only but was 
morally and spiritually also a true son. <br><br>60The words clearly tell that 
the son had not taken the dream of his Prophet father to be a mere dream but a 
Command from Allah. Had it not been a Command actually, it was necessary that 
Allah should have explicitly or implicitly stated that the son of Abraham had 
mistaken it for a command. But the whole context is without any such allusion. 
On this very basis, there is the Islamic belief that the dream of the Prophets 
is never a mere dream it is also a kind of Revelation. Obviously, if a thing, 
which could become such a fundamental principle in the Divine Shari'ah, had not 
been based on reality, but had been a mere misunderstanding, it was not possible 
that Allah should not have refuted it. It is impossible for the one who believes 
the Qur'an to be Allah's Word, to accept That such an error and omission could 
emanate from Allah also. <br><br>61That is, "The Prophet Abraham did not make 
his son lit flat on his back but made him lie prostrate lest while slaughtering 
him the sight of his face should arouse compassion and lout and make him shaky. 
Therefore, he wanted to use the knife from under the throat" . <br><br>62One 
section of the grammarians says that here "and" has been use to mean "then"; 
thus, the sentence would be: "When the two had submitted themselves (to Allah) 
and Abraham had flung his son down on his brow, then We called out. . . " But 
another section of them says that here the answer to the word "when" has been 
omitted and left for the listener to fill; for it was better w leave such an 
indescribable thing to the imagination instead of expressing it in words. When 
Allah might have seen that the old father who had got a son after long earnest 
prayers, has become ready to sacrifice him only for His pleasure and approval; 
and the son also had became ready to get slaughtered, His infinite Mercy might 
have been aroused at the sight, and the Master might have felt great love for 
the father and son. All this can only be imagined. No words would ever describe 
the scene adequately. <br><br>63That is, "We did not make you see in the dream 
that you had actually slaughtered your son and he had died, but that you were 
slaughtering him. That Vision you have fulfilled. Now, it is not Our will to 
take the life of your child: the actual object of the vision has been fulfilled 
by your submission and preparation to sacrifice him for Our sake." <br><br>
64That is, "We do not subject the people who adopt the righteous way to trials 
in order to involve them in trouble and distress and affliction just for the 
sake of it, but these trials are meant to bring out their excellencies and to 
exalt them to high ranks, and then We deliver them also safe and sound from the 
dilemma in which We place them for the sake of the trial. Thus, your willingness 
and preparation to sacrifice yow son is enough to entitle you to be exalted to 
the rank that could be attained only by the one who would actually have 
slaughtered his son for Our approval and pleasure. Thus, We have saved the life 
of yow child as well as exalted you to this high rank. " <br><br>65That is, "The 
object was not to get yow son slaughtered through you but to test you to see 
that you did not hold anything of the world dearer than Us.<br><br>66"A great 
sacrifice" : A ram, as mentioned in the Bible and the Islamic traditions, that 
Allah's angel presented at the time before the Prophet Abraham, so that he 
should sacrifice it instead of his son. This has been called "a great sacrifice" 
because it was to serve as a ransom from a faithful servant like Abraham for a 
patient and obedient son like Ishmael, and Allah made it a means of fulfilling 
the intention of an unprecedented sacrifice. Another reason for calling it "a 
great" sacrifice is that Allah made it a tradition till the Day of Resurrection 
that all the believers should offer animal sacrifice on the same date in the 
entire world so as to keep fresh the memory of the great and unique event 
signifying faithfulness and devotion." <br><br>67Here, the question arises: Who 
was the son whom the Prophet Abraham had got ready to offer as a sacrifice, and 
who had willingly offered himself to be slaughtered as a sacrifice? The first 
answer to this question is given by the Bible; and it is this:<br><br>"And it 
came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, 
Abraham: . . . Take now thy son thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get 
thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one 
of the mountains which I will tell thee of." (Gen. 22: 1-2).<br><br>In this 
statement, on the one hand, it is being said that Allah had asked for the 
offering of the Prophet Isaac, and on the other, that he was Abraham's only son, 
whereas the Bible itself, at other places, conclusively states that the Prophet 
Isaac was. not the only son of the Prophet Abraham.Consider the following 
statements of the Bible:<br><br>"Now Sarai, Abram's wife bore him no children: 
and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto 
Abraham, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go 
in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abraham 
hearkened to the voice of Sarai. And Sarai Abraham's wife took Hagar her maid 
the Egyptian, after Abraham had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave 
her husband Abram to be his wife. And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived." 
(Gen .16: 1-4)<br><br>"And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold thou art 
with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael." (16: 11)<br>
<br>"And Abraham was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to 
Abraham." (16: 16).<br><br>"And God said unto Abraham, `As for Sarai thy wife, 
..... I will bless her and give thee a son also of her: . . . . . and thou shalt 
call his name Isaac . . .. . . which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time 
in the next year And Abraham took Ishmael his son and ......every male among the 
men of Abraham's house; and . .. . . circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in 
the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. And Abraham was ninety years old and 
nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son 
was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. " 
(Gen. 17: 15-25).<br><br>"And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son 
Isaac was born unto him. " (Gen. 21: 5).<br><br>This brings out the 
contradictions of the Bible. It is evident that for 14 years the Prophet Ishmael 
was the only son of the Prophet Abraham. Now if the offering had been asked of 
the only son, it was not of Isaac but of Ishmael, for he alone was the only son; 
and if the offering of Isaac had been asked, it would be wrong to say that the 
offering of the only son had been asked.<br><br>Now let us consider the Islamic 
traditions, and they contain great differences. According to traditions cited by 
the commentators from the Companions and their immediate followers, one group of 
them is of the opinion that the son was the Prophet Isaac, and this group 
contains the following names:<br><br>Hadrat `Umar, `Hadrat `Ali, `Hadrat 
`Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat `Abbas bin `Abdul Muttalib, Hadrat `Abdullah bin 
`Abbas, Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Hasan Basri, Said bin Jubair, 
Mujahid, Sha`bi, Masruq, Makhul, Zuhri, `Ata, Muqatil, Suddi, Ka'b Ahbar, Zaid 
bin Aslam, and others.<br><br>The other group says that it was the Prophet 
Ishmael, and this group contains the names of the following authorities:<br><br>
Hadrat Abu Bakr, Hadrat 'Ali, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 
'Abbas, Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Hadrat Mu'awiyah, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Yusuf bin 
Mahran, Hasan Basri, Muhammad bin Ka`b al-Qurzi, Sha`bi, Said bin al-Musayyab, 
Dahhak, Muhammad bin 'Ali bin Husain (Muhammad alBaqir), Rabi` bin Anas, Ahmed 
bin Hanbal, and others.<br><br>When compared, the two lists will be seen to 
contain several common names: this is due to the reason that from the same 
person two different views have been reported. For example, from Hadrat 
'Abdullah bin `Abbas, `Ikrimiah has related the saying that the son was the 
Prophet Isaac, but from him again `Ata' bin Abi Rabah relates: "The Jews claim 
that it was Isaac, but the Jews tell a tie. " Likewise. from Hadrat Hasan Basri, 
one tradition is to the effect that the Prophet Isaac was the son meant to be 
made the offering, but `Umar bin `Ubaid says that Hasan Basri had no doubt 
regarding that the son whom the Prophet Abraham had been commanded to offer as a 
sacrifice was the Prophet Ishmael (peace be upon him).<br><br>This diversity of 
tradition has resulted in the diversity of opinion among the scholars of Islam. 
Some of them e.g. Ibn Jarir and Qadi `Iyad, have expressed the firm opinion that 
the son was the Prophet Isaac. Others, like Ibn Kathir have given the verdict 
that it were the Prophet Ishmael. There ware others who are un-certain and 
wavering, e.g. Jalaluddin Suyuti. However, a deep inquiry into the question 
establishes the fact that the son intended to be offered as a sacrifice was the 
Prophet Ishmael. The following are the arguments:<br><br>(1) As stated by the 
Qur'an above, at the time of his emigration from the country, the Prophet 
Abraham had prayed for a righteous son and in answer to it, Allah had given him 
the good news of a clement boy. The context shows that this prayer was made at a 
time when he was childless, and the boy whose good news was given was his 
first-born child. Then, this also becomes obvious froth the Qur'anic story that 
when the child grew up to boyhood, he was inspired to offer him as an offering. 
Now, it is established beyond any doubt that the Prophet Abraham's first-born 
son was the Prophet Ishmael and not the Prophet Isaac. The Qur'an itself has 
stated the order between the two sons, thus: "All praise be to Allah Who has 
given me sons like Ishmael and Isaac in my old age." (Ibrahim: 39).<br><br>(2) 
The words used in the Qur'an with regard to the Prophet Isaac while giving the 
good news of his birth are: "And they gave him the good news of the birth of a 
son, possessing knowledge, ('alim). " (AdhDhariyat: 28 "Do not be afraid: we 
give you the good news of a son, possessing knowledge." (AI-Hijr: 53). But the 
son, the good news of whose birth has been given here; has been called a clement 
(halim) son. This shows that the two sons had distinctive qualities, and the 
offering had been asked of the clement son and not of the son possessing 
knowledge.<br><br>(3) Along with giving the good news of the birth of the 
Prophet Isaac in the Qur'an, the good news of the birth of a grandson like Jacob 
was also given: 'Then We gave her the good news of Isaac, and after Isaac of 
Jacob." (Hud: 71). Now obviously, if about the son along with the news of whose 
birth the news of a worthy son to be born to him had also been given, the 
Prophet Abraham was shown a vision that he was sacrificing him, he would never 
have understood that he was being inspired to offer that very son as an 
offering. 'Allama Ibn Jarir contends that the Prophet Abraham might have been 
shown this vision at a time when Jacob had already been born to the Prophet 
Isaac. But this is, in. fact, a very weak reply to the argument. The Qur'an 
says: 'When the boy became able to work with his father," then he was shown the 
vision Anyone who reads these words with an unbiased mind will have the image of 
an 8 to 10 years lad beforc him. No one can imagine that these words had been 
used about a young man having children.<br><br>(4) Allah, at the end of the 
story, says: "We gave him the good news of Isaac, a Prophet among the 
righteous." This clearly shows that it was not the same son, whom he had been 
inspired to offer as a sacrifice; but before this the good news of some other 
son had been given; then when he grew up and became able to work with his 
father, it was commanded to sacrifice him. Afterwards, when the Prophet Abraham 
came through this test successfully, he was given the good news of the birth of 
another son, the Prophet Isaac (may peace be upon him). This order of the events 
conclusively proves that the son whom the Prophet Abraham had been commanded to 
sacrifice was not Isaac but another son who had been born several years beforc 
him, 'Allama Ibn Jarir rejects this express argument, saying that in the 
beginning only the good news of the birth of the Prophet Isaac had been given. 
Then, when he became ready to be scarificed for the sake of Allah's approval and 
pleasure, it was rewarded in the form of the good news of his Prophethood. But 
this reply to the argument is weaker still. If it had really been so, Allah 
would not have said: ¦We gave him the good news of Isaac, a Prophet among the 
righteous," but "We gave him the good news that this same son of yours would be 
a Prophet among the righteous."<br><br>(5) Authentic traditions confirm that the 
horns of the ram which was slaughtered as a ransom for the Prophet Ishmael 
remained preserved in the Holy Ka'bah till the time of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 
Zubair. Afterwards when Hajjaj bin Yusuf besieged Ibn Zubair in the Ka'bah and 
demolished the Kab'bah, the horns also were destroyed. Both Ibn 'Abbas and 'Amir 
Sha'bi; testify that they had seen the horns in the Ka'bah. (Ibn Kathir). This 
is a proof of the fact that the event of the sacrifice had taken place in Makkah 
and not in Syria, and concerned the Prophet Ishmael. That is why a relic of it 
had been preserved in the Holy Ka'bah built by the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael.<br>
<br>(6) The Arab traditions confirmed that this event of the sacrifice had taken 
place in Mina (near Makkah), and it was not only a tradition but practically 
also it had been a part of the Hajj rites for centuries. Even until the time of 
the Holy Prophet people used to offer the animal sacrifice in Mina at the place 
where the Prophet Abraham had offered the sacrifice. Afterwards when the Holy 
Prophet was raised as a Prophet, he also maintained and continued the same 
tradition; so that even till today sacrifices are offered in Mina on the 10th of 
Dhil-Hajj. This continual practice of 4,500 years or so is an undeniable proof 
of the fact that the heirs to the tradition of sacrifice made by the Prophet 
Abraham have been the descendants of the Prophet Ishmael and not of the Prophet 
Isaac. There has never been any such tradition among the descendants of the 
Prophet Isaac according to which the whole community might have offered the 
sacrifice at one and the same time and regarded it as a continuation of the 
sacrifice made by the Prophet Abraham.<br><br>In the face of such arguments it 
appears strange how the idea of the Prophet Isaac's being the son offered as the 
sacrifice spread among the Muslim community itself. If the Jews might have tried 
to attribute the honor to their ancestor, the Prophet Isaac, by depriving the 
Prophet Ishmael of it, it would be understandable.<br><br>But the question is: 
How did a large number of the Muslims come to accept this wrong notion? A very 
satisfactory answer to this question has been given by 'Allama Ibn Kathir in his 
commentary. He says: "The reality is known to Allah alone but it appears that 
all the sayings (in which the Prophet Isaac has been mentioned as the son 
offered as a sacrifice) are related from Ka`b Ahbar. This man, when he became a 
Muslim in the time of Hadrat 'Umar, used to relate before him the contents of 
the ancient Jewish and Christian scriptures, and Hadrat 'Umar would hear them. 
On this basis, the other people also began to listen to him, and started 
relating every mixture of the truth and falsehood that they heard from him, 
whereas this Ummah did not stand in need of anything whatever from the store of 
his knowledge and information.'<br><br>This thing is further explained by a 
tradition from Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Kurzi He says that once during his presence 
the question whether the son offered as a sacrifice was the Prophet Isaac or the 
Prophet Ishmael arose before Hadrat 'Umar bin 'Abdul `Aziz. Among them at that 
time was a person who had been a Jewish scholar but had become a sincere Muslim 
afterwards. He said, "O Commander of the Faithful! By God it was Ishmael, and 
the Jews know it, but claim on account of their jealousy of the Arabs that it 
was the Prophet Isaac." (Ibn Jarir). When the two things are put side by side, 
it becomes evident that actually it was the Jewish propaganda that spread among 
the Muslims who have always been unbiased in scholastic literary matters, a 
large number of them accepted the statements of the Jews as a historic truth, 
which they presented as historical traditions with reference to the ancient 
scriptures, and did not realize that these were based on prejudice instead of 
knowledge. <br><br>68This sentence throws light on the real object for which 
this event of the Prophet Abraham's sacrifice has been related here. From the 
race of his two sons arose two great nations in the world. First, the children 
of Israel, from whose house two major religions (Judaism and Christianity) 
emerged, which dominated and won over large human populations. Second, the 
children of Ishmael, who were the religious leaders and guides of All the Arabs 
at the time of the revelation of the Qur'an, and the tribe of Quraish of Makkah 
at that time held the most important position among them. Whatever eminence 
these two branches of the offspring of the Prophet Abraham attained became 
possible only on account of their connection and relation with the Prophet 
Abraham and his two illustrious sons; otherwise, God alone knows how many such 
families have arisen in the world and been assigned to oblivion. Now, Allah 
relates the most glorious event of the history of this family and makes both its 
branches realize that whatever honor and eminence they have attained in the 
world, has been due actually to the great traditions of God-worship and 
sincerity and obedience, which were set by their ancestors, the Prophets Abraham 
and Ishmael and Isaac (may peace be upon them all). He tells them: `The great 
blessings which We bestowed on them, were not bestowed arbitrarily and 
haphazardly: We did not just pick out a person and his two sons blindly and 
blessed them, but they gave definite proofs of their loyalty and faithfulness to 
their real Master and then became deserving of His favors. Now, you cannot 
become entitled to those favors merely on the basis of your pride of descent, 
for We shall see who among you is righteous and who is wicked and then deal with 
him accordingly."<br><br>69"A great distress": the distress in which they were 
involved at the hands of Pharaoh and his people. <br><br>70The Prophet Elias was 
from among the Israelite Prophets. He has been mentioned only twice in the 
Qur'an, here and in Surah AI-An'am: 85. The present-day scholars have determined 
his period between 875 and 850 B.C. He was an inhabitant of Gilead, which in 
ancient days was the territory now under the northern districts of the modern 
state of Jordan, to the south of the River Yarmuk. In the Bible he has been 
mentioned as Elijah the Tishbite. Here is briefly his life story:<br><br>After 
the death of the Prophet Solomon the Israelite kingdom was broken up into two 
parts due mainly to the unworthiness of his son, Rehoboam. One part which 
consisted of Jerusalem and southern Palestine remained with the descendants of 
the Prophet David, while in the second, which comprised northern Palestine, an 
independent state by the name of Israel was established with Samaria as its 
capital. Although conditions in both the states were very bad, the state of 
Israel, from the very beginning, followed the path of depravity due to which the 
evils of polytheism and idol-worship and tyranny and wickedness went on 
increasing and multiplying in it endlessly; so much so that when Ahab, the king 
of Israel, married Jezebel, the daughter of the king of Sidon (Lebanon), the 
mischief reached its extremity. Under the influence of this polytheistic 
princess Ahab himself became a polytheist. He built a temple and altar to Baal 
in Samaria, tried his very best to introduce and popularize Baal-worship instead 
of the worship of One God. and consequently, offerings began to be made publicly 
in the name of Baal in the Israelite towns and cities.<br><br>This was the time 
when the Prophet Elijah (peace be upon him) appeared on the scene. He came from 
Gilead and gave Ahab a notice that in consequence of his sins, the land of 
Israel would go without rain, even without the dew. This word of the Prophet of 
Allah proved to be literally true and there fell no rain in Israel for thee and 
a half years. At last, Ahab came to his senses and he got the Prophet Elijah 
searched out But Elijah, before praying for the rain, thought it necessary to 
snake the distinction between Allah, Lord of the worlds, and Baal plain before 
the people of Israel. For this purpose, he commanded that the priests of Baal 
would make an offering in the name of their deity, and he also would make an 
offering in the name of Allah, Lord of the worlds, in front of the assembled 
people. Then the one whose offering would be consumed by a fire from heaven, 
without the agency of the human hand, the truth of his deity would be 
established beyond doubt. Ahab accepted this proposal. Thus, 850 of the priests 
of Baal assembled on Mt. Carmel to answer the challenge given by the Prophet 
Elijah. In this encounter the Ba'al worshipers were defeated, and the Prophet 
Elijah proved that Baal was 'a false god, and the real God is the One God alone 
who had appointed him as His Prophet. After this, Elijah got the priests of Baal 
slaughtered in front of the same assembly of the people; then he prayed for the 
rain, and his prayer was immediately answered and the whole land of Israel was 
saturated with water<br><br>But, despite these miracles, Ahab could not shake 
off the influence of his polytheistic wife. Jezebel turned hostile to the 
Prophet Elijah and she hoped that he would be put to death just as the Baal 
worshipers had been put to death. Under the circumstances the Prophet Elijah was 
compelled to leave the country and he remained lodged in a cave at the foot of 
Mt. Sinai for several years. The lamentation that he made to Allah, on this 
occasion, has been related in the Bible, in these words:<br><br>'The children of 
Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy 
prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to 
take it away." (I Kings, 19: 10).<br><br>About the same time Jehoram, the ruler 
of the Jewish state of Jerusalem, married the daughter of Ahab, the king of 
Israel, and under her polytheistic influence the same evils that had spread in 
Israel also began to spread in Judah. The Prophet Elijah carried out his 
prophetic duty again and wrote a letter to Jehoram, the following words of which 
have been reported in the Bible:<br><br>"Thus saith the Lord God of David thy 
father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor 
in the ways of Asa king of Judah. But hast walked in the way of the kings of 
Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, 
like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of 
thy father's house, which were better than thyself: Behold,with a great plague 
will the Lord smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy 
goods: And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy 
bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day." (2 Chronicles, 21: 
12-15).<br><br>Whatever the Prophet Elijah had prophesied in this letter proved 
true. First, the kingdom of Jehoram was destroyed by the external invaders, and 
the enemies even carried away his wives, then he himself died of the disease of 
the bowels.<br><br>A few years later the Prophet Elijah again went to Israel and 
constantly tried hard to bring Ahab, and after him his son, Ahaziah, to the 
right path, but the evil that had taken root in the house of the royal family of 
Samaria could not be eradicated. At last, due to the curse of the Prophet the 
family of Ahab met its doom, and then Allah recalled his Prophet from the world.<br>
<br>For details, see the following books of the Bible: I Kings, chs., 17, 18, 
19, 21; 2 Kings, chs.; 1, 2; 2 Chronicles, ch. 21. <br><br>71Lexically, ba'al 
means master, chief and possessor. This word was also used for husband, and has 
been used in this sense at several places in the Qur'an itself, e.g. in Surah 
AI-Baqarah: 228, An-Nisa': 127, Hud: 72 and An-Nur: 31. However; in the ancient 
times the Semetic nations used it in the meaning of deity or lord; they had even 
given the name of Baal to a special god. The chief male god of the Phoenicians, 
in particular, was Baal and their chief goddess was Ashtoreth, his wife. The 
scholars differ as to whether Baal meant the sun or Jupiter, and Ashtoreth the 
moon or Venus. In any case, historically it is certain that Baal worship was 
prevalent from Babylon to Egypt throughout the Middle East, and the polytheistic 
communities of the Lebanon and Syria and Palestine, in particular, had become 
its devotees. When the Israelites settled in Palestine and Jordan after they 
came out from Egypt, they started contracting marriage and other social 
relations with the polytheistic nations round about them, in violation of the 
strict prohibitive injunctions of the Torah, the disease of idol-worship began 
to spread among them, too. According to the Bible, this moral and religious 
decline had started appearing among the Israelites soon after the death of 
Joshua, son of Nun, who was the first caliph of the Prophet Moses:<br><br>'And 
the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim 
...... And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtoreth." (Judges, 2: 
11-13).<br><br>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, 
and Amorites, and Perizzites and Hivites, and Jebusites. And they took their 
daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served 
their gods.' (Judges, 3: 5-6).<br><br>At that time worship of Baal had so deeply 
affected the Israelites that, according to the Bible, in one of their 
habitations a public altar had been built at which offerings were made to Baal. 
A God-worshiping Israelite could not bear the sight; so he pulled down the altar 
one night. Next morning a great multitude of the people gathered together and 
demanded that the man who had cast down the altar he put to death. (Judges, 
6:25-32). This evil, at last, was put to an end by . Samuel, Saul and the 
Prophets David and Solomon (peace be upon them); they not only reformed the 
Israelites generally but also eradicated polytheism and idol worship from their 
kingdom. But after the death of the Prophet Solomon the mischief was again 
revived and the Israelite state of northern Palestine was swept away in the Hood 
of Baal-worship. <br><br>72That is "Only those people will be made an exception 
from the punishment, who did not belie the Prophet Elijah, and whom Allah chose 
from among the nation for His worship. " <br><br>73The treatment that the 
Israelites meted out to the Prophet Elijah in his life has been referred to 
above, but after his death they became so enamored of him that they held him in 
the highest esteem and reverence after the Prophet Moses. They formed the belief 
that Elijah (peace be upon him) had been taken up alive into heaven by a 
whirlwind (2 Kings, ch. 2), and that he will come back to the world again. Thus, 
in Malachi (O.T.) it is written:<br><br>"Behold, I will send you Elijah the 
Prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." (4: 5).<br>
<br>At the tune the Prophets John and Jesus (peace be upon them) appeared, the 
Jews were awaiting the advent of these three men: the Prophet Elias, the Christ 
and "that Prophet" (i.e. the Holy Prophet Muhammad). When the ministry of the 
Prophet John began and he slatted baptizing the people, the Jews sent priests to 
him to ask, "Are you the Christ ?" And he said that he was not the Christ. Then 
they asked, "Are you Elias?" And he answered that he was not Elias; then they 
asked, "Are you 'that Prophet'?" And he answered that he was not "that Prophet" 
either. Thereupon they said, "If you are neither the Christ, nor Elias, nor that 
Prophet, why do you then baptize ?" (John, 1: 19-26). Afterwards when the name 
of the Prophet Jesus spread among the people, the Jews thought that perhaps the 
Prophet Elias had come. (Mark, 6: 14-15). Even among the disciples of Jesus 
themselves the idea was common that Elias the Prophet would come, but Jesus 
removed their misunderstanding, saying, 'Elias is come already, and they knew 
him not, but have done unto him whatever they listed." Then the disciples 
understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist and not of Elias who had 
appeared tight hundred years earlier. (Matthew. 11: 14; and 17: 10-131.) <br>
<br>74The words in the original are: Salam-un 'ala El-ya-sin. Some commentators 
say that EI ya-sin is the other name of the Prophet Elias, just as Abraham is 
the other name of the Prophet Ibrahim; some others say that different versions 
of the Hebrew names were prevalent among the Arabs, e.g. one and the same angel 
was called Michal and Micha'il and Micha'in. The same has been the case with the 
name of the Prophet Elias also. In the Qur'an itself the same mountain has been 
called Tur Sina' and Tur Sinin.<br><br>75This implies the wife of the Prophet 
Lot, who did not migrate with her illustrious husband, but remained behind with 
her people and was punished. <br><br>76The reference is to the mined habitations 
of the people of Lot by which the Quraishite merchants passed day and night 
during their trade journeys to Syria and Palestine. <br><br>77This is the third 
place where the Prophet Jonah (peace be upon him) has been mentioned in the 
Qur'an. Before this he has already been mentioned in Surah Yunus and Surah 
Al-Anbiya`. (For reference, please see yunus: 98 and AI-Anbiya`: 87-88 and the 
E.N.'s thereof). <br><br>78The word ebaqe in Arabic is used for the flight and 
escape of a slave from his master's house. <br><br>79This is what one 
understands from a study of these sentences:<br><br>(1) The vessel which the 
Prophet Jonah boarded was already overloaded.<br><br>(2) Lots were drawn in the 
vessel probably at a time when during the voyage it was felt that the lives of 
the passengers had been endangered due to the overloading; therefore, lots were 
cast to pick oat a person to be thrown overboard.<br><br>(3) The lot fell on the 
Prophet Jonah, and so he was thrown into the sea. and a fish swallowed him.<br>
<br>(4) The Prophet Jonah was so afflicted because he had fled and abandoned the 
place of his mission without the permission of his Master (Allah Almighty). This 
meaning is confirmed by the word abaqa as has been explained in E.N. 78 above, 
and also by the word mulim. Mulim IS a blameworthy person, who becomes worthy of 
blame by himself because of his sin and error, whether somebody else blames him 
for it or not. (Ibn Jarir). <br><br>80It has two meanings and both are implied: 
(1) That the Prophet Jonah was not of the people who are heedless of God, but 
was of those who glorify and adore Allah constantly and perpetually; and (2) 
that when he went inside the fish, he turned to Allah alone and glorified Him. 
In Surah AI-Anbiya' it has been said: He invoked Us from the depths of the 
darkness, saying: `There is no god but You: Glory be to You: I am indeed 
blameworthy. " (v. 87). <br><br>81This does not mean that the fish would have 
lived till Resurrection and the Prophet Jonah would have remained alive in its 
belly till then, but that the fish's belly would have become his grave till 
Resurrection. The famous commentator Qatadah has given this same meaning of this 
verse. (Ibn Jarir). <br><br>82That is, "When the Prophet Jonah confessed his 
fault, and began to glorify Allah like a true and sincere believer, the fish 
spat him up on the beach by Allah's Command. The beach was a bare plain, without 
any vegetation on it, or anything to provide him shade, or any means of food." .<br>
<br>Here, the rationalists have been heard expressing the misgiving that it is 
impossible for a man to come out alive from the belly of a fish. But, towards 
the end of the last century, an event took place near the sea-shores of England 
(the center of this so-called rationalism), which belies this claim. In August, 
1891, some fishermen went to the high sea to hunt whales in a ship called Star 
of the East. There they injured a great fish which was 20 feet long, 5 feet wide 
and weighed a hundred tons, but during the struggle the fish swallowed a 
fisherman, James Bartley, in front of the very eyes of his companions. Next day 
the same fish was found dead on the sea. The fishermen hauled it up on board and 
when they cut open its belly, James Bartley came out alive. He had remained in 
the fish's belly for full 60 hours. (Urdu Digest, February, 1964). Obviously, 
when such a thing is possible in normal circumstances naturally, wiry should it 
be impossible under abnormal conditions as a miracle of God? <br><br>83The 
Arabic word yaqtin applies to a tree which does not stand on a stem but grows 
and spreads like a creeper, e.g. a pumpkin, cucumber, water-melon, etc. In any 
case, a creeper was produced miraculously, so that its leaves should provide 
shade to the Prophet Jonah and its fruit should serve him both as food and as 
shade. <br><br>84The mention of "a hundred thousand people or more" does not 
mean that Allah had any doubt about their number, but it means that a casual 
observer would have estimated the population to be more than a hundred thousand 
people in any case. Probably it was the same place which the Prophet Jonah had 
left and fled. After his departure when the people of the place saw the scourge 
approaching they believed, but this was only a kind of repentance which was 
accepted and the scourge averted. Now, the Prophet Jonah was again sent .to them 
so drat the people should believe in him as a Prophet and become Muslims 
formally. To understand this, one should keep in view verse 98 of Surah Yunus.
<br><br>85Some people have taken exception to what we have written concerning 
this story of the Prophet Jonah in our commentary of Surahs Yunus and 
AI-Anbiya'. It would therefore be proper that we should reproduce here the 
explanations given by the other commentators in this regard.<br><br>The famous 
commentator Qatadah in his commentary of verse 98 of Surah Yunus says: There has 
been no habitation which disbelieved and might have believed after the arrival 
of the scourge, and then might have been left unpunished. The only exception 
were the people of the Prophet Jonah. When they searched for their Prophet and 
did not find him, and felt that the scourge had approached near at hand, Allah 
put repentance in their hearts. " (Ibn Kathir, vol. II, p. 433).<br><br>
Commenting on the same verse 'Allama Alusi; says: "The Prophet Jonah (peace be 
upon him) had been sent to the people of Nineveh in the land of Mosul. They were 
polytheistic people. The Prophet Jonah invited them to believe in Allah, the 
One, and to give up idol-worship. They refused to believe and belied him. Jonah 
gave them the news that they would be visited by a scourge after three days and 
he left the place at midnight before the expiry of the three days. Then, in the 
day time when the scourge approached...... and the people realized that they 
would all perish, they began to search for the Prophet but did not find him. At 
last, they took their families and their cattle and came out in the desert and 
expressed belief and repentance.......So, Allah showed them mercy and accepted 
their prayer. " (Ruh al-Ma ani, vol. XI, p. 170).<br><br>Commenting on v. 87 of 
Surah Al-Anbiya', `Allama Alusi writes: "The Prophet Jonah's forsaking his 
people in anger was an act of migration, but he had not been commanded to do 
so." (Ruh al-Ma'ani, vol. XVII, p. 77). Then he explains the meaning of the 
sentence, "Inna kun-tu min-az-zalimin ", of Jonah's prayer, thus:`That is, I was 
blameworthy in that I hastened to migrate, against The way of the Prophets, 
before receiving the command for it. " This was, in fact, a confession of his 
sin and expression of repentance so that Allah might remove his affliction. (Ruh 
al-Ma'ani, vol. :XVII, p. 78).<br><br>Maulana Ashraf `Ali Thanwi's note on this 
verse is: "He became angry with his people when they did not believe, and 
forsook them, and did not return to them of his own accord when the scourge had 
been averted, and did not await Our Command for the migration." (Bayan 
al-QurÆan).<br><br>Maulana Shabbir Ahmad 'Uthmani writes in his note on this 
verse: "Vexed at the misconduct of his people he left the city in anger, did not 
await the Divine Command and threatened the people that they would be visited by 
a torment after three days......lnni kun-tu min az-Zalimin: He confessed his 
error that he had made haste and left the habitation without awaiting Allah's 
Command.,<br><br>"Explaining these verses of Surah Saaffat, Imam Razi writes: 
"The Prophet Jonah's fault was that when Allah threatened to destroy the people 
who had belied him, he thought that the scourge would inevitably befall them. 
Therefore, he did not show patience and abandoned his mission and left the 
place, whereas he ought to have continued the work of his mission, for there was 
a possibility that Allah might not destroy those people." (Tafsir Kabir, vol. 
VII, p. 158).<br><br>Explaining the verse Idh abaqa......, Allama .Alusi writes: 
`Literally, abaqa means the escape of a slave from his master's house. Since 
Jonah had run away from his people without Allah's leave, the word has been 
rightly used about him." Then he writes: "When the third day came, the Prophet 
Jonah left the place without Allah's permission. Thus, when his people did not 
find him, they came out along with their young and old people and their cattle, 
and they implored Allah and begged for His forgiveness and Allah forgave them.' 
(Ruh al-Ma 'ani, vol. XXII, p. 13).<br><br>Maulana Shabbir Ahmad 'Uthmani has 
explained the words wa huwa mulim thus: `The accusation against him was that he 
had left the city because of an error of judgment, without awaiting the Divine 
Command, and even specified the day for the coming of the scourge."<br><br>Then 
Maulana Shabbir Ahmad's note on v. 48 of Surah AI-Qalam is: "Do not be perplexed 
and agitated with regard to the deniers like the Man of the Fish (i.e. the 
Prophet Jonah)." And about the sentence: wa huwa makzum of the same verse, he 
writes: "That is, he was full of anger against his people, so he prayed for the 
torment, rather foretold it, in fretful haste."<br><br>These explanations by the 
commentators clearly show that there were three offenses on account of which the 
Prophet Jonah was made to suffer Allah's displeasure:<br><br>(1) That he himself 
fixed the day of the torment, whereas Allah had not made any declaration in this 
regard;<br><br>(2) that he emigrated from the city even before the day came; 
whereas a Prophet should not leave the place of his mission until Allah commands 
him to do so; and<br><br>(3) that he did not return to his people after the 
torment had been averted from them.<br><br>86Another theme starts from here. In 
the preceding theme that started from v. 11, the Quraish had been put this 
question: "Ask them: what is more difficult: their own creation or of those 
things that We have created?" Now, they are being asked this second question. 
The object of the first question was to warn the disbelievers of their deviation 
because of which they regarded life-after-death and the meting out of rewards 
and punishments as impossible, and therefore, mocked the Holy Prophet for it. 
Now they are being asked this second question to warn them of their ignorance 
due to which they attributed children to Allah and would join anybody with Allah 
in any relationship they liked on mere conjecture. <br><br>87Traditions show 
that in Arabia the tribes of Quraish, Juhainah, Bani Salimah, Khuza'ah, Bani 
Mulaih, etc., held the belief that the angels were Allah's daughters. This 
belief of their ignorance has been referred to at several places in the Qur'an, 
e.g. in An-Nisa': 117, An-Nahl: 57-58, Bani Isra'il: 40, Az-Zukhruf: 16; 19, 
An-Najm: 21-27. <br><br>88That is, "There can be only two bases for regarding 
the angels as the daughters of Allah: Either such a thing could be said on the 
basis of observation, or the one who asserted it should possess a Divine book in 
which Allah Himself might have stated that the angels were His daughters. Now, 
if those who held such belief could neither make a claim to have observed such a 
thing nor did they possess any divine book that might contain such a thing, 
there could be no greater stupidity than this that one should base one's 
religious belief on mere conjecture, and attribute to Allah, Lord of the worlds, 
such things as were patently ridiculous.<br><br>89Though the word used is al 
jinnah instead of al-mala'ikah, some major commentators have opined that here 
the word jinn has been used for mala ikah in its literal sense (of hidden 
creation); mala ikah (angels) also are, in reality, a hidden creation, and the 
following theme also demands that al jinnah here be taken in the sense of 
al-mala'ikah <br><br>90Another translation of this verse can be: "Therefore, you 
and your worship: on this you cannot tempt into mischief anyone except him . . . 
" According to this second translation, the meaning would be: "O you who have 
gone astray, by this worship that you arc performing before us, and regarding us 
as the children of Allah, Lord of the worlds, you cannot tempt us into mischief. 
By this you can only beguile a fool who might be working for his own doom. So, 
we refuse to fall into the trap that you have set for us." <br><br>91That is, 
"Not to speak of being Allah's children, we do not have the power to exceed in 
any way or degree the place and position and status appointed for each of us by 
Allah."<br><br>92This same thing has already been mentioned in Surah Fatir: 42 
above. <br><br>93"Allah's army": implies the believers who obey Allah's 
Messenger and side with him. This also includes those unseen powers by which 
Allah helps the followers of the truth.<br><br>This help and domination does not 
necessarily mean that in every age every Prophet of Allah and his followers must 
attain political dominance, but this dominance has many forms, one of which is 
political rule as well. Wherever the Prophets of Allah did not attain any such 
dominance, they did establish their moral superiority even in those places. The 
nations which did not accept their message and adopted a way contrary to their 
teachings, were ultimately doomed to destruction. Whatever philosophies of error 
and misguidance the people invented and whatever corrupt and evil practices of 
life they, enforced died out ultimately after they had their sway for some time. 
But the truths preached by the Prophets of Allah for thousands of years have 
been unalterable before as they are unalterable today. No one has been able to 
disprove them in any way. <br><br>94That is, `It will not take long when they 
will see their defeat and your victory with their own eyes." This proved to be 
true as it had been foretold. Hardly 14 to 15 years had passed after the 
revelation of these vases when the pagans of Makkah witnessed the Holy Prophet 
enter their city as a conqueror, and then a few years later the same people saw 
that Islam had overwhelmed not only Arabia but the mighty empires of Rome and 
Iran as well.</p>
