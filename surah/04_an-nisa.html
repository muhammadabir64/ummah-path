                  <li class="collection-item"> O mankind! reverence your Guardian-Lord, who created you from a single person, created, of like nature, His mate, and from them twain scattered (like seeds) countless men and women;- reverence Allah, through whom ye demand your mutual (rights), and (reverence) the wombs (That bore you): for Allah ever watches over you.</li><li class="collection-item"> To orphans restore their property (When they reach their age), nor substitute (your) worthless things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by mixing it up) with your own. For this is indeed a great sin.</li><li class="collection-item"> If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.</li><li class="collection-item"> And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, Take it and enjoy it with right good cheer.</li><li class="collection-item"> To those weak of understanding Make not over your property, which Allah hath made a means of support for you, but feed and clothe them therewith, and speak to them words of kindness and justice.</li><li class="collection-item"> Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off, Let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account.</li><li class="collection-item"> From what is left by parents and those nearest related there is a share for men and a share for women, whether the property be small or large,-a determinate share.</li><li class="collection-item"> But if at the time of division other relatives, or orphans or poor, are present, feed them out of the (property), and speak to them words of kindness and justice.</li><li class="collection-item"> Let those (disposing of an estate) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own if they had left a helpless family behind: Let them fear Allah, and speak words of appropriate (comfort).</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, eat up a Fire into their own bodies: They will soon be enduring a Blazing Fire!</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children´s (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased Left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases (´s) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing, Al-wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> In what your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child; but if they leave a child, ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies and debts. In what ye leave, their share is a fourth, if ye leave no child; but if ye leave a child, they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question, has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that no loss is caused (to any one). Thus is it ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-knowing, Most Forbearing.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those are limits set by Allah: those who obey Allah and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein (for ever) and that will be the supreme achievement.</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide therein: And they shall have a humiliating punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, Take the evidence of four (Reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way.</li><li class="collection-item"> If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah accept the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and repent soon afterwards; to them will Allah turn in mercy: For Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> Of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil, until death faces one of them, and he says, "Now have I repented indeed;" nor of those who die rejecting Faith: for them have We prepared a punishment most grievous.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and Allah brings about through it a great deal of good.</li><li class="collection-item"> But if ye decide to take one wife in place of another, even if ye had given the latter a whole treasure for dower, Take not the least bit of it back: Would ye take it by slander and manifest wrong?</li><li class="collection-item"> And how could ye take it when ye have gone in unto each other, and they have Taken from you a solemn covenant?</li><li class="collection-item"> And marry not women whom your fathers married,- except what is past: It was shameful and odious,- an abominable custom indeed.</li><li class="collection-item"> Prohibited to you (For marriage) are:- Your mothers, daughters, sisters; father´s sisters, Mother´s sisters; brother´s daughters, sister´s daughters; foster-mothers (Who gave you suck), foster-sisters; your wives´ mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in,- no prohibition if ye have not gone in;- (Those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful;-</li><li class="collection-item"> Also (prohibited are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess: Thus hath Allah ordained (Prohibitions) against you: Except for these, all others are lawful, provided ye seek (them in marriage) with gifts from your property,- desiring chastity, not lust, seeing that ye derive benefit from them, give them their dowers (at least) as prescribed; but if, after a dower is prescribed, agree Mutually (to vary it), there is no blame on you, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> If any of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those whom your right hands possess: And Allah hath full knowledge about your faith. Ye are one from another: Wed them with the leave of their owners, and give them their dowers, according to what is reasonable: They should be chaste, not lustful, nor taking paramours: when they are taken in wedlock, if they fall into shame, their punishment is half that for free women. This (permission) is for those among you who fear sin; but it is better for you that ye practise self-restraint. And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah doth wish to make clear to you and to show you the ordinances of those before you; and (He doth wish to) turn to you (In Mercy): And Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah doth wish to Turn to you, but the wish of those who follow their lusts is that ye should turn away (from Him),- far, far away.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah doth wish to lighten your (difficulties): For man was created Weak (in flesh).</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities: But let there be amongst you Traffic and trade by mutual good-will: Nor kill (or destroy) yourselves: for verily Allah hath been to you Most Merciful!</li><li class="collection-item"> If any do that in rancour and injustice,- soon shall We cast them into the Fire: And easy it is for Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> If ye (but) eschew the most heinous of the things which ye are forbidden to do, We shall expel out of you all the evil in you, and admit you to a gate of great honour.</li><li class="collection-item"> And in no wise covet those things in which Allah Hath bestowed His gifts More freely on some of you than on others: To men is allotted what they earn, and to women what they earn: But ask Allah of His bounty. For Allah hath full knowledge of all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> To (benefit) every one, We have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parents and relatives. To those, also, to whom your right hand was pledged, give their due portion. For truly Allah is witness to all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband´s) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all).</li><li class="collection-item"> If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> Serve Allah, and join not any partners with Him; and do good- to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbours who are near, neighbours who are strangers, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (ye meet), and what your right hands possess: For Allah loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious;-</li><li class="collection-item"> (Nor) those who are niggardly or enjoin niggardliness on others, or hide the bounties which Allah hath bestowed on them; for We have prepared, for those who resist Faith, a punishment that steeps them in contempt;-</li><li class="collection-item"> Not those who spend of their substance, to be seen of men, but have no faith in Allah and the Last Day: If any take the Evil One for their intimate, what a dreadful intimate he is!</li><li class="collection-item"> And what burden Were it on them if they had faith in Allah and in the Last Day, and they spent out of what Allah hath given them for sustenance? For Allah hath full knowledge of them.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubleth it, and giveth from His own presence a great reward.</li><li class="collection-item"> How then if We brought from each people a witness, and We brought thee as a witness against these people!</li><li class="collection-item"> On that day those who reject Faith and disobey the messenger will wish that the earth Were made one with them: But never will they hide a single fact from Allah!</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Approach not prayers with a mind befogged, until ye can understand all that ye say,- nor in a state of ceremonial impurity (Except when travelling on the road), until after washing your whole body. If ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of nature, or ye have been in contact with women, and ye find no water, then take for yourselves clean sand or earth, and rub therewith your faces and hands. For Allah doth blot out sins and forgive again and again.</li><li class="collection-item"> Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? they traffic in error, and wish that ye should lose the right path.</li><li class="collection-item"> But Allah hath full knowledge of your enemies: Allah is enough for a protector, and Allah is enough for a Helper.</li><li class="collection-item"> Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places, and say: "We hear and we disobey"; and "Hear what is not Heard"; and "Ra´ina"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: "What hear and we obey"; and "Do hear"; and "Do look at us"; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye People of the Book! believe in what We have (now) revealed, confirming what was (already) with you, before We change the face and fame of some (of you) beyond all recognition, and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers, for the decision of Allah Must be carried out.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah forgiveth not that partners should be set up with Him; but He forgiveth anything else, to whom He pleaseth; to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin Most heinous indeed.</li><li class="collection-item"> Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who claim sanctity for themselves? Nay-but Allah Doth sanctify whom He pleaseth. But never will they fail to receive justice in the least little thing.</li><li class="collection-item"> Behold! how they invent a lie against Allah! but that by itself is a manifest sin!</li><li class="collection-item"> Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? they believe in sorcery and Evil, and say to the Unbelievers that they are better guided in the (right) way Than the believers!</li><li class="collection-item"> They are (men) whom Allah hath cursed: And those whom Allah Hath cursed, thou wilt find, have no one to help.</li><li class="collection-item"> Have they a share in dominion or power? Behold, they give not a farthing to their fellow-men?</li><li class="collection-item"> Or do they envy mankind for what Allah hath given them of his bounty? but We had already given the people of Abraham the Book and Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him: And enough is Hell for a burning fire.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who reject our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall soon admit to Gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,- their eternal home: Therein shall they have companions pure and holy: We shall admit them to shades, cool and ever deepening.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah doth command you to render back your Trusts to those to whom they are due; And when ye judge between man and man, that ye judge with justice: Verily how excellent is the teaching which He giveth you! For Allah is He Who heareth and seeth all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if ye do believe in Allah and the Last Day: That is best, and most suitable for final determination.</li><li class="collection-item"> Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee? Their (real) wish is to resort together for judgment (in their disputes) to the Evil One, though they were ordered to reject him. But Satan´s wish is to lead them astray far away (from the right).</li><li class="collection-item"> When it is said to them: "Come to what Allah hath revealed, and to the Messenger": Thou seest the Hypocrites avert their faces from thee in disgust.</li><li class="collection-item"> How then, when they are seized by misfortune, because of the deeds which they hands have sent forth? Then their come to thee, swearing by Allah: "We meant no more than good-will and conciliation!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Those men,-Allah knows what is in their hearts; so keep clear of them, but admonish them, and speak to them a word to reach their very souls.</li><li class="collection-item"> We sent not a messenger, but to be obeyed, in accordance with the will of Allah. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come unto thee and asked Allah´s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah indeed Oft-returning, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> But no, by the Lord, they can have no (real) Faith, until they make thee judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against Thy decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction.</li><li class="collection-item"> If We had ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes, very few of them would have done it: But if they had done what they were (actually) told, it would have been best for them, and would have gone farthest to strengthen their (faith);</li><li class="collection-item"> And We should then have given them from our presence a great reward;</li><li class="collection-item"> And We should have shown them the Straight Way.</li><li class="collection-item"> All who obey Allah and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah,- of the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!</li><li class="collection-item"> Such is the bounty from Allah: And sufficient is it that Allah knoweth all.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth in parties or go forth all together.</li><li class="collection-item"> There are certainly among you men who would tarry behind: If a misfortune befalls you, they say: "Allah did favour us in that we were not present among them."</li><li class="collection-item"> But if good fortune comes to you from Allah, they would be sure to say - as if there had never been Ties of affection between you and them - "Oh! I wish I had been with them; a fine thing should I then have made of it!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Let those fight in the cause of Allah Who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah,- whether he is slain or gets victory - Soon shall We give him a reward of great (value).</li><li class="collection-item"> And why should ye not fight in the cause of Allah and of those who, being weak, are ill-treated (and oppressed)?- Men, women, and children, whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from thee one who will protect; and raise for us from thee one who will help!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject Faith Fight in the cause of Evil: So fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan.</li><li class="collection-item"> Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity? When (at length) the order for fighting was issued to them, behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah: They said: "Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight? Wouldst Thou not Grant us respite to our (natural) term, near (enough)?" Say: "Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!</li><li class="collection-item"> "Wherever ye are, death will find you out, even if ye are in towers built up strong and high!" If some good befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah"; but if evil, they say, "This is from thee" (O Prophet). Say: "All things are from Allah." But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact?</li><li class="collection-item"> Whatever good, (O man!) happens to thee, is from Allah; but whatever evil happens to thee, is from thy (own) soul. and We have sent thee as a messenger to (instruct) mankind. And enough is Allah for a witness.</li><li class="collection-item"> He who obeys the Messenger, obeys Allah: But if any turn away, We have not sent thee to watch over their (evil deeds).</li><li class="collection-item"> They have "Obedience" on their lips; but when they leave thee, a section of them Meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But Allah records their nightly (plots): So keep clear of them, and put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs.</li><li class="collection-item"> Do they not consider the Qur´an (with care)? Had it been from other Than Allah, they would surely have found therein Much discrepancy.</li><li class="collection-item"> When there comes to them some matter touching (Public) safety or fear, they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger, or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have Tested it from them (direct). Were it not for the Grace and Mercy of Allah unto you, all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan.</li><li class="collection-item"> Then fight in Allah´s cause - Thou art held responsible only for thyself - and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the Unbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner therein: And whoever recommends and helps an evil cause, shares in its burden: And Allah hath power over all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> When a (courteous) greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous, or (at least) of equal courtesy. Allah takes careful account of all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah! There is no god but He: of a surety He will gather you together against the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. And whose word can be truer than Allah´s?</li><li class="collection-item"> Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way.</li><li class="collection-item"> They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks;-</li><li class="collection-item"> Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If Allah had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you: Therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and (instead) send you (Guarantees of) peace, then Allah Hath opened no way for you (to war against them).</li><li class="collection-item"> Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people: Every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto: if they withdraw not from you nor give you (guarantees) of peace besides restraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them: In their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them.</li><li class="collection-item"> Never should a believer kill a believer; but (If it so happens) by mistake, (Compensation is due): If one (so) kills a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the deceased´s family, unless they remit it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (Is enough). If he belonged to a people with whom ye have treaty of Mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, (is prescribed) a fast for two months running: by way of repentance to Allah: for Allah hath all knowledge and all wisdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> If a man kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell, to abide therein (For ever): And the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him, and a dreadful penalty is prepared for him.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of Allah, investigate carefully, and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: "Thou art none of a believer!" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with Allah are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His favours: Therefore carefully investigate. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do.</li><li class="collection-item"> Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,-</li><li class="collection-item"> Ranks specially bestowed by Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. For Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> When angels take the souls of those who die in sin against their souls, they say: "In what (plight) Were ye?" They reply: "Weak and oppressed Were we in the earth." They say: "Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to move yourselves away (From evil)?" Such men will find their abode in Hell,- What an evil refuge! -</li><li class="collection-item"> Except those who are (really) weak and oppressed - men, women, and children - who have no means in their power, nor (a guide-post) to their way.</li><li class="collection-item"> For these, there is hope that Allah will forgive: For Allah doth blot out (sins) and forgive again and again.</li><li class="collection-item"> He who forsakes his home in the cause of Allah, finds in the earth Many a refuge, wide and spacious: Should he die as a refugee from home for Allah and His Messenger, His reward becomes due and sure with Allah: And Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> When ye travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if ye shorten your prayers, for fear the Unbelievers May attack you: For the Unbelievers are unto you open enemies.</li><li class="collection-item"> When thou (O Messenger) art with them, and standest to lead them in prayer, Let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with thee, Taking their arms with them: When they finish their prostrations, let them Take their position in the rear. And let the other party come up which hath not yet prayed - and let them pray with thee, Taking all precaution, and bearing arms: the Unbelievers wish, if ye were negligent of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if ye put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because ye are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the Unbelievers Allah hath prepared a humiliating punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> When ye pass (Congregational) prayers, celebrate Allah´s praises, standing, sitting down, or lying down on your sides; but when ye are free from danger, set up Regular Prayers: For such prayers are enjoined on believers at stated times.</li><li class="collection-item"> And slacken not in following up the enemy: If ye are suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but ye have Hope from Allah, while they have none. And Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> We have sent down to thee the Book in truth, that thou mightest judge between men, as guided by Allah: so be not (used) as an advocate by those who betray their trust;</li><li class="collection-item"> But seek the forgiveness of Allah; for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> Contend not on behalf of such as betray their own souls; for Allah loveth not one given to perfidy and crime:</li><li class="collection-item"> They may hide (Their crimes) from men, but they cannot hide (Them) from Allah, seeing that He is in their midst when they plot by night, in words that He cannot approve: And Allah Doth compass round all that they do.</li><li class="collection-item"> Ah! These are the sort of men on whose behalf ye may contend in this world; but who will contend with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Judgment, or who will carry their affairs through?</li><li class="collection-item"> If any one does evil or wrongs his own soul but afterwards seeks Allah´s forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> And if any one earns sin. he earns it against His own soul: for Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> But if any one earns a fault or a sin and throws it on to one that is innocent, He carries (on himself) (Both) a falsehood and a flagrant sin.</li><li class="collection-item"> But for the Grace of Allah to thee and his Mercy, a party of them would certainly have plotted to lead thee astray. But (in fact) they will only Lead their own souls astray, and to thee they can do no harm in the least. For Allah hath sent down to thee the Book and wisdom and taught thee what thou Knewest not (before): And great is the Grace of Allah unto thee.</li><li class="collection-item"> In most of their secret talks there is no good: But if one exhorts to a deed of charity or justice or conciliation between men, (Secrecy is permissible): To him who does this, seeking the good pleasure of Allah, We shall soon give a reward of the highest (value).</li><li class="collection-item"> If anyone contends with the Messenger even after guidance has been plainly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that becoming to men of Faith, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen, and land him in Hell,- what an evil refuge!</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah forgiveth not (The sin of) joining other gods with Him; but He forgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins than this: one who joins other gods with Allah, Hath strayed far, far away (from the right).</li><li class="collection-item"> (The Pagans), leaving Him, call but upon female deities: They call but upon satan the persistent rebel!</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah did curse him, but he said: "I will take of Thy servants a portion Marked off;</li><li class="collection-item"> "I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah." Whoever, forsaking Allah, takes satan for a friend, hath of a surety suffered a loss that is manifest.</li><li class="collection-item"> Satan makes them promises, and creates in them false desires; but satan´s promises are nothing but deception.</li><li class="collection-item"> They (his dupes) will have their dwelling in Hell, and from it they will find no way of escape.</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness,- we shall soon admit them to gardens, with rivers flowing beneath,-to dwell therein for ever. Allah´s promise is the truth, and whose word can be truer than Allah´s?</li><li class="collection-item"> Not your desires, nor those of the People of the Book (can prevail): whoever works evil, will be requited accordingly. Nor will he find, besides Allah, any protector or helper.</li><li class="collection-item"> If any do deeds of righteousness,- be they male or female - and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them.</li><li class="collection-item"> Who can be better in religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.</li><li class="collection-item"> But to Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth: And He it is that Encompasseth all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> They ask thy instruction concerning the women say: Allah doth instruct you about them: And (remember) what hath been rehearsed unto you in the Book, concerning the orphans of women to whom ye give not the portions prescribed, and yet whom ye desire to marry, as also concerning the children who are weak and oppressed: that ye stand firm for justice to orphans. There is not a good deed which ye do, but Allah is well-acquainted therewith.</li><li class="collection-item"> If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband´s part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men´s souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practise self-restraint, Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.</li><li class="collection-item"> Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is your ardent desire: But turn not away (from a woman) altogether, so as to leave her (as it were) hanging (in the air). If ye come to a friendly understanding, and practise self-restraint, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> But if they disagree (and must part), Allah will provide abundance for all from His all-reaching bounty: for Allah is He that careth for all and is Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> To Allah belong all things in the heavens and on earth.

Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the scripture which He hath sent to His Messenger and the scripture which He sent to those before (him). Any who denieth Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Day of Judgment, hath gone far, far astray.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who believe, then reject faith, then believe (again) and (again) reject faith, and go on increasing in unbelief,- Allah will not forgive them nor guide them nor guide them on the way.</li><li class="collection-item"> To the Hypocrites give the glad tidings that there is for them (but) a grievous penalty;-</li><li class="collection-item"> Yea, to those who take for friends unbelievers rather than believers: is it honour they seek among them? Nay,- all honour is with Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> Already has He sent you Word in the Book, that when ye hear the signs of Allah held in defiance and ridicule, ye are not to sit with them unless they turn to a different theme: if ye did, ye would be like them. For Allah will collect the hypocrites and those who defy faith - all in Hell:-</li><li class="collection-item"> (These are) the ones who wait and watch about you: if ye do gain a victory from Allah, they say: "Were we not with you?"- but if the unbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): "Did we not gain an advantage over you, and did we not guard you from the believers?" but Allah will judge betwixt you on the Day of Judgment. And never will Allah grant to the unbelievers a way (to triumphs) over the believers.</li><li class="collection-item"> The Hypocrites - they think they are over-reaching Allah, but He will over-reach them: When they stand up to prayer, they stand without earnestness, to be seen of men, but little do they hold Allah in remembrance;</li><li class="collection-item"> (They are) distracted in mind even in the midst of it,- being (sincerely) for neither one group nor for another whom Allah leaves straying,- never wilt thou find for him the way.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe!

Nay, it is Allah that recogniseth (all good), and knoweth all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah loveth not that evil should be noised abroad in public speech, except where injustice hath been done; for Allah is He who heareth and knoweth all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> Whether ye publish a good deed or conceal it or cover evil with pardon, verily Allah doth blot out (sins) and hath power (in the judgment of values).</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who deny Allah and His messengers, and (those who) wish to separate Allah from His messengers, saying: "We believe in some but reject others": And (those who) wish to take a course midway,-</li><li class="collection-item"> They are in truth (equally) unbelievers; and we have prepared for unbelievers a humiliating punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> To those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of the messengers, we shall soon give their (due) rewards: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> The people of the Book ask thee to cause a book to descend to them from heaven: Indeed they asked Moses for an even greater (miracle), for they said: "Show us Allah in public," but they were dazed for their presumption, with thunder and lightning.

Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allah aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) a messenger of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His messengers. Say not "Trinity" : desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is one Allah: Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.</li><li class="collection-item"> Christ disdaineth nor to serve and worship Allah, nor do the angels, those nearest (to Allah): those who disdain His worship and are arrogant,-He will gather them all together unto Himself to (answer).</li><li class="collection-item"> But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, He will give their (due) rewards,- and more, out of His bounty: But those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish with a grievous penalty; Nor will they find, besides Allah, any to protect or help them.</li><li class="collection-item"> O mankind! verily there hath come to you a convincing proof from your Lord: For We have sent unto you a light (that is) manifest.</li><li class="collection-item"> Then those who believe in Allah, and hold fast to Him,- soon will He admit them to mercy and grace from Himself, and guide them to Himself by a straight way.</li><li class="collection-item"> They ask thee for a legal decision.

                      <p><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>

This Surah comprises several discourses which 
were revealed on different occasions during the period ranging probably between 
the end of A.H. 3 and the end of A.H. 4 or the beginning of A.H. 5. Although it 
is difficult to determine the exact dates of their revelations, yet it is 
possible to assign to them a fairly correct period with the help of the 
Commandments and the events mentioned therein and the Traditions concerning 
them. A few instances are given below by way of illustration:<br><br>We know 
that the instructions about the division of inheritance of the martyrs and for 
the safeguard of the rights of the orphans were sent down after the Battle of 
Uhd in which 70 Muslims were killed. Then naturally the question of the division 
of the inheritance of the martyrs and the safeguard of the rights of their 
orphans arose in many families at Al-Madinah. From this we conclude that vv. 1 
-28 were revealed on that occasion.<br><br>We learn from the Traditions that the 
Commandment about salat during war time was given on the occasion of 
Zat-ur-Riqa'a, an expedition which took place in A. H. 4. From this we conclude 
that the discourse containing v. 102 was revealed on that occasion.<br><br>The 
last warning (v. 47) to the Jews was given before the Banu Nadir were exiled 
from Al-Madinah in Rabi'-ulAwwal, A. H. 4. From this it may safely be concluded 
that the discourse containing v. 47 must have been revealed some time before 
that date.<br><br>The permission about tayammum (the performance of ablutions 
with pure dust, in case no water be available) was given during the Bani-al-Mustaliq 
expedition, which took place in A. H. 5.. Therefore the probable period of the 
revelation of the discourse containing v. 43 was A. H. 5.<br><br><strong>Topics and 
Their Background</strong><br><br>Let us now consider the social and historical 
considerations of the period in order to understand the Surah. All the 
discourses in this Surah deal with three main problems which confronted the Holy 
Prophet at the time. First of all, he was engaged in bringing about an all round 
development of the Islamic Community that had been formed at the time of his 
migration to Al-Madinah. For this purpose he was introducing new moral, 
cultural, social, economic and political ways in place of the old ones of the 
pre-Islamic period. The second thing that occupied his attention and efforts was 
the bitter struggle that was going on with the mushrik Arabs, the Jewish clans 
and the hypocrites who were opposing tooth and nail his mission of reform. Above 
all he had to propagate Islam in the face of the bitter opposition of these 
powers of evil with a view to capturing more and more minds and hearts.<br><br>
Accordingly, detailed instructions have been given for the consolidation and 
strengthening of the Islamic Community in continuation of those given in Al-Baqarah. 
Principles for the smooth running of family life have been laid down and ways of 
settling family disputes have been taught. Rules have been prescribed for 
marriage and rights of wife and husband have been apportioned fairly and 
equitably. The status of women in the society has been determined and the 
declaration of the rights of orphans has been made laws and regulations have 
been laid down for the division of inheritance, and instructions have been given 
to reform economic affairs. The foundation of the penal code has been laid down 
drinking has been prohibited, and instructions have been given for cleanliness 
and purity. The Muslims have been taught the kind of relations good men should 
have with their Allah and fellow men. Instructions have been given for the 
maintenance of discipline in the Muslim Community.<br><br>The moral and 
religious condition of the people of the Book has been reviewed to teach lessons 
to the Muslims and to forewarn them to refrain from following in their 
footsteps. The conduct of the hypocrites has been criticized and the distinctive 
features of hypocrisy and true faith have been clearly marked off to enable the 
Muslims to distinguish between the two.<br><br>In order to cope with the 
aftermath of the Battle of Uhd, Inspiring discourses were sent down to urge the 
Muslims to face the enemy bravely, for the defeat in the Battle had so 
emboldened the mushrik Arab clans and the neighboring Jews and the hypocrites at 
home that they were threatening the Muslims on all sides. At this critical 
juncture, Allah filled the Muslims with courage and gave them such instructions 
as were needed during that period of war clouds. In order to counteract the 
fearful rumors that were being spread by the hypocrites and the Muslims of weak 
faith, they were asked to make a thorough inquiry into them and to inform the 
responsible people about them. Then they were experiencing some difficulties in 
offering their salat during the expeditions to some places where no water was 
available for performing their ablutions, etc. In such cases they were allowed 
to cleanse themselves with pure earth and to shorten the salat or to offer the "Salat 
of Fear", when they were faced with danger. Instructions were also given for the 
solution of the puzzling problem of those Muslims who were scattered among the 
unbelieving Arab clans and were often involved in war. They were asked to 
migrate to Al-Madinah, the abode of Islam.<br><br>This Surah also deals with the 
case of Bani Nadir who were showing a hostile and menacing attitude, in spite of 
the peace treaties they had made with the Muslims. They were openly siding with 
the enemies of Islam and hatching plots against the Holy Prophet and the Muslim 
Community even at Al-Madinah itself. They were taken to task for their inimical 
behavior and given a final warning to change their attitude, and were at last 
exiled from Al-Madinah on account of their misconduct.<br><br>The problem of the 
hypocrites, who had become very troublesome at that time, was involving the 
Believers in difficulties-- Therefore they were divided into different 
categories to enable the Muslims to deal with them appropriately.<br><br>Clear 
instructions were also given regarding the attitude they should adopt towards 
the non-belligerent clans. The most important thing needed at that time was to 
prepare the Muslims for the bitter struggle with the opponents of Islam. For 
this purpose greatest importance was attached to their character building, for 
it was obvious that the small Muslim Community could only come out successful, 
nay, survive, if the Muslims possessed high moral character. They were, 
therefore, enjoined to adopt the highest moral qualities and were severely 
criticized whenever any moral weakness was detected in them.<br><br>Though this 
Surah mainly deals with the moral and social reforms, yet due attention has been 
paid to propagation of Islam. On the one hand, the superiority of the Islamic 
morality and culture has been established over that of the Jews, Christians and 
mushriks; on the other hand, their wrong religious conceptions, their wrong 
morality and their evil acts have been criticized to prepare the ground for 
inviting them to the way of the Truth.<br><br><strong>Subject: Consolidation of the 
Islamic Community</strong><br><br>The main object of this Surah is to teach the Muslims 
the ways that unite a people and make them firm and strong. Introductions for 
the stability of family, which is the nucleus of community have been given. Then 
they have been urged to prepare themselves for defense. Side by side with these, 
they have been taught the importance of the propagation of Islam. Above all, the 
importance of the highest moral character in the scheme of consolidation of the 
Community has been impressed.<br><br><strong>Topics and their Interconnection</strong><br><br>
Just, fair and equitable laws and regulations for the smooth running of family 
life have been laid down for the husband and wife. Detailed instructions have 
been given for the division of inheritance and due regard has been paid to the 
rights of orphans. 1 - 35<br><br>In order to inculcate the right spirit for the 
observance of rules and regulations, the Muslims have been enjoined to show 
generosity to all around them and to be free from meanness, selfishness, 
stinginess of mind, because this is essential for the consolidation of the 
Communities and helpful for the propagation of Islam. 36 - 42<br><br>The ways of 
the purification of mind and body for the offering of Salat have been taught 
because it plays the most important part in every scheme of moral and social 
reform. 43<br><br>After moral preparation, instructions for defense have been 
given. First of all, the Muslims have been warned to be on their guard against 
the cunning machinations and vile practices of the local Jews who were hostile 
to the New Movement. This caution was necessary for removing some possible 
misunderstanding that might have arisen on account of the pre-Islamic alliance 
between the people of Al-Madinah and the Jews. 44 - 57<br><br>Then they have 
been enjoined to place their trusts and offices of trust in the custody of 
honest and qualified persons, and to do what is just and right, and to obey 
Allah and His Messenger and those among themselves entrusted with the conduct of 
their affairs and to turn to Allah and His Messenger for the settlement of their 
disputes. As such an attitude and behavior alone can ensure consolidation, they 
have been strongly warned that any deviation from this path will lead to their 
disintegration. 58 - 72<br><br>After this pre-requisite, they have been exhorted 
to make preparation for defense and to fight bravely for the cause of Islam, 
without showing any kind of cowardice or weakness. They have also been warned to 
be on their guard against hypocrites. A line of demarcation has been drawn to 
distinguish the intentional shirkers from the helpless devotees. 73 - 100<br>
<br>Here again instructions have been given for the offering of Salat during 
military campaigns and actual fighting. This is to impress the importance of 
Salat even at the time of fear and danger. 101 - 103<br><br>Before proceeding on 
to the next topic, the Muslims have been exhorted to persevere in their fight 
without showing any kind of weakness. 104<br><br>In order to make the Islamic 
Community firm and strong for defense, the Muslims have been enjoined to observe 
the highest standard of justice. The Muslims are required to deal out strict 
justice even in case of the enemy, with whom they might be involved in war. They 
should also settle disputes between husband and wife with justice. In order to 
ensure this, they should keep their beliefs and deeds absolutely free from every 
kind of impurity and should become the standard bearers of justice. 105 - 135<br>
<br>Resuming the theme of defense, the Muslims have been warned to be on their 
guard against their enemies. They have been admonished to take necessary 
precautions against the machinations of the hypocrites and the unbelievers and 
the people of the Book. As belief in Allah, and Revelation and Life-after-death 
is the only safeguard against every kind of enemy, they should sincerely believe 
in and follow His Messenger, Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). 136 - 175<br>
<br>Though this verse also deals with the family laws contained in verses 1 - 
35, it has been added as a supplement at the end of this Surah because it was 
revealed long after An-Nisa was being recited as a complete Surah. 176<br>

<br>This introduction beautifully 
suits the subsequent laws and regulations about human rights, specially about 
the smooth running of the family life. On the one hand, the people have been 
urged to fear Allah so as to escape His displeasure; on the other, they have 
been reminded that all human beings have sprung from one and the same parents 
and are thus closely related to one another. "....He created you of a single 
soul".At first one human being was created and then from him the ttumatt race 
spread over the earth. Therefore they should strictly observe the ties and 
obligations of kin-ship. We learn from another part of the Qur'an that Adam was 
that "single soul." He was the first Man from whom the whole of mankind sprang 
up and spread over the earth. "....and of the same created his mate:" We have no 
definite detailed knowledge of how his mate was created of him. The commentators 
generally say that Eve was created from the rib of Adam and the Bible also 
contains the same story. The Talmud adds to it that she was created from the 
thirteenth rib of Adam. But the Qur'an is silent about it, and the Tradition of 
the Holy Prophet that is cited in support of this has a different meaning from 
what has been understood. The best thing, therefore, is to leave it undefined as 
it has been left in the Qur'an, and not to waste time in determining its 
details.<br><br>2That is, as long "As the orphans are under age, spend their 
property only in their interest; and when they come of age, return their 
rightful property to them." <br><br>3This is a comprehensive sentence, which may 
mean, "Do not make your Income unclean in any unlawful way." It may also mean, 
"Do not exchange your worthless things for the valuable things of the orphans."
<br><br>4The commentators ascribe three meanings to this:<br><br>(a) Hadrat 'A ' 
ishah says that this was revealed to remedy an evil that was prevalent in the 
days of "Ignorance." The guardians of the orphan girls used to marry them for 
their wealth and beauty, with the intention of keeping them under their power 
because they had no one to defend their cause; then they treated them unjustly 
without any fear. Therefore when they became Muslims, they had misgivings about 
marrying orphan girls. Accordingly, the Qur'an advised them to marry women of 
their choice other than orphan girls in their charge, if they feared that they 
would not be able to do justice to them. Verse 127 of this Surah also supports 
this comment.<br><br>(b) In commenting on this, Hadrat Ibn-i-`Abbas and his 
disciple `Ikrimah assert that this Commandment was given to eradicate an 
injustice that was prevalent at that time. In pre-Islamic days, there was no 
limit to the number of wives and some people would marry even a dozen of them 
but when they could not meet the increasing expenses, they were forced to grab 
the property of their orphan nephews and other helpless relatives. Therefore, 
Allah restricted the maximum number of wives to four, and enjoined that this 
too, was subject to the condition that one should do justice to all of them.<br>
<br>(c) SaÆid bin Jubair, Qatadah and some other commentators declare that this 
Command was given to safeguard the interests of wives. They say that even before 
the advent of Islam, injustice to the orphans was looked upon with disfavor, but 
in regard to wives, it was different; they would marry as many as they liked and 
would treat them cruelly and unjustly without any fear of the society or pangs 
of conscience. Therefore Allah warned them that they should refrain from doing 
injustice to their wives as they did in the case of the orphans. Therefore they 
should not marry more than four wives and that too, only if they would do 
justice to them.<br><br>The words of the verse bear all the three meanings and 
probably all three are meant. Another meaning also can be: "If you cannot treat 
the orphans justly as they normally should be, you may marry the women who have 
orphan children." <br><br>5The consensus of opinion of all the scholars of the 
Muslim law is that this verse limits the number of wives and prohibits the 
keeping of more than four at one and the same time. Traditions also support 
this. It is related that at the time when Ghailan, the chief of Ta`if, became a 
Muslim, he had nine wives. The Holy Prophet asked him to keep only four of them 
and divorce all the others. There is another instance of Naufal bin Mu`aviyah, 
who was ordered by the Holy Prophet to divorce one of his five wives.<br><br>It 
should also be noted that this verse restricts polygamy with the provision of 
justice to all the wives; therefore whoever abuses this permission without 
fulfilling the condition of justice and marries more wives than one tries to 
deceive Allah. The courts of an Islamic State are, therefore, empowered to 
enforce justice in order to rectify the wrong done to a wife or wives. At the 
same time it is absolutely wrong to conclude from the proviso of justice, 
attached to this Commandment, that this verse was really meant to abolish 
polygamy. This is not the view of the Qur'an, but of those Muslims who have been 
overawed by the Christians of the West. They say that the Qur'an is also against 
polygamy but it did trot abolish it directly because it did not consider it 
expedient at the time for the custom had become very common. Instead of this, it 
allows polygamy provided that justice is done to all the wives. As this 
condition is most difficult to fulfill, the recommendation is towards monogamy. 
Obviously, this way of thinking is the result of mental slavery, because 
polygamy in itself is not an evil for in some cases it becomes a real cultural 
and moral necessity. There are Borne people, who, even if they wished, cannot 
remain content with one wife. Polygamy comes to their rescue and saves them and 
the society in general from the harms of unlicensed sexual indulgences. That is 
why the Qur'an allows polygamy to such people with the explicit condition of 
doing justice to all the wives.<br><br>As regards those who consider polygamy to 
be an evil, they are free to oppose the Qur'an and condemn polygamy, but they 
have no right to ascribe their own perverted views to the Qur'an, for it makes 
this lawful in very clear language without employing any words that might be 
stretched in any way to imply that the Qur'an means to abolish it. (For further 
explanation, please consult my book .Snnat ki A 'ini Hathiyyat, pp. 307-3161.
<br><br>6"Those women": slave girls captured in war and distributed among the 
people by the government. It tray either mean: "If you cannot bear the expenses 
of a free woman, you may marry a slave girl as permitted in.v. 25," or it may 
mean: "If you need more wives than one but are afraid that you might not be able 
to do justice to your wives from among the free people, you may turn to slave 
girls because in that case you will be burdened with less responsibilities. (For 
details please refer to E.N. 44 below).<br><br>7Hadrat `Umar and Qadi Shuraih 
have ruled that if a wife remits the whole of her dowry or a part of it but 
later on demands it, the husband shall be compelled to pay it because the very 
fact that she demands it is a clear proof that she did not remit it of her own 
free will. (For further details, consult my book Huquq-uz-Zaujain, under the 
caption Dowry) <br><br>8This verse is very comprehensive in meaning. It teaches 
the Muslim ' Community the lesson that in no case should wealth, which is so 
important for the maintenance of life, be entrusted to such people as are 
feeble-minded and incapable of using or .managing it properly, for they might, 
by its wrong use, spoil its cultural and economic system and, in the long run, 
its moral system as well. ft is true that the rights of private ownership must 
be honored, but at the same time they are not to be so unlimited as to allow one 
to use them in any way one likes and create social chaos. As far as one's 
necessities of life are concerned, they must be fulfilled but none should be 
allowed to use these rights to the extent that is harmful to the collective 
moral, cultural and economic good of the Community. According to this verse, 
every owner of wealth should consider seriously before entrusting his wealth to 
anyone whether that person is capable of using it properly. On the larger scale, 
the Islamic State should take into its own custody the property of those who are 
found incapable of using it properly, or of those who may be using it in wrong 
ways but should arrange for the provision of their necessities of life. <br><br>
9That is, "When they are about to attain their puberty, keep an eye upon them 
and go on testing their intelligence in order to see how far they have become 
capable of looking after their own affairs." <br><br>10Two conditions of puberty 
and capability have been laid down for the return of their property to the 
orphans. As to the application of the first condition, there is consensus among 
the scholars of law, but in regard to the second condition there is some 
difference of opinion. Imam Abu Hanifah is of the opinion that if the orphan 
lacks capability when he reaches the age of puberty, his guardian may wait for a 
maximum period of seven years, and then he must return this property to him 
whether he shows signs of capability or not. But Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad 
and Imam Shaf'i are of the opinion that capability is a pre-requisite for .the 
return of his property to the orphan. Probably these latter scholars were 
inclined to the opinion that the case of such a person should be referred to a 
Muslim judge, who would himself arrange for the management of the property of 
the one who has not acquired capability of management. <br><br>11That is, "He 
should charge for his services only that much as may be considered fair by every 
unbiased person and that he should charge openly and keep an account of it."<br>
<br>12This verse contains five legal regulations about inheritance. First, that 
not only men but the women also have a share in the inheritance. Second, that it 
must be divided among all heirs, however little or insignificant it is; so much 
so that even if the deceased has left one yard of cloth and there are ten heirs, 
it must also be cut into ten parts. However, an heir may buy the shares of 
others by mutual consent. Third, that the verse also implies that this law 
applies to all sorts of property, transferable or non-transferable, agricultural 
or industrial, or of any other type. Fourth, that the right of inheritance 
becomes valid only when the deceased leaves some property behind him. Fifth, 
that when the nearest relatives are alive the distant relatives have no right in 
the inheritance.<br><br>13Here the heirs of the deceased have been enjoined to 
be generous towards distant and near relatives and the indigent members of the 
family and orphans who happen to be present on the occasion of the division of 
inheritance, though they might have no share in it. They should give them also 
something and speak gently to them and avoid using harsh and unkind words as the 
narrow minded people generally use on such occasions. <br><br>14According to a 
Tradition this verses were revealed in response to the request of the widow of 
Hadrat Sa'd bin Rubai'. She came to the Holy Prophet with her two daughters and 
said, "O Messenger of Allah, here are the daughters of Sa'd who has been 
martyred in the battle of Uhd. Their uncle has taken possession of the whole of 
his property and has not left a single penny for them. Now who is going to marry 
them after this? <br><br>15The first guiding principle about the division of 
inheritance is that the share of the male shall be double that of the female, 
and this is very sound and just. As the Muslim law lays the major burden of the 
economic responsibility of the family on the male and keeps the female almost 
free from it, justice demands that her share of inheritance should be less than 
that of the male. <br><br>16The same applies to the case of two daughters as 
well. It means that if the deceased leaves no son but only daughters, whether 
they are two or more, they shall be entitled to two-thirds of the whole 
inheritance and the remaining one-third shall be divided among the other heirs. 
As a corollary of this, if the deceased leaves only one son, there is a 
consensus of opinion that he shall be entitled to the whole of the inheritance 
in the absence of other heirs and if there are other heirs too, he shall receive 
the whole of the retraining inheritance after the allotment of their shares. <br>
<br>17Each of the parents of the deceased shall be entitled to one-sixth of the 
inheritance, if he leaves behind a child or children whether they are only 
daughters or only sons or both sons and daughters, or only one son or only one 
daughter. As regards the remaining two-thirds, it shall be divided among the 
other heirs. <br><br>18The remaining two-thirds shall be given to the father, if 
there be no other heir; otherwise the father shall share two-thirds with the 
other heirs. <br><br>19If the deceased has brothers and sisters, the share of 
the mother has been reduced froth one-third to one-sixth. This reduced one-sixth 
will be added to the father's share, for in that case the father's 
responsibilities are increased. It should be noted that the brothers and sisters 
of the deceased are not entitled to any share if the parents are alive. <br><br>
20The mention of the fulfillment of the will precedes the payment of the debt, 
for every deceased person may not owe a debt, but he must make his will. As 
regards the enforcement of the law, the consensus of opinion of the whole Muslim 
Community is that the payment of debt must have priority over the fulfillment of 
the will. That is, the debt, if any, must be paid first and then the terms of 
the will should be enforced and after this the inheritance should be divided. In 
E.N. 182 of Al-Baqarah, it has been stated that one has the right to bequeath by 
will one-third of the whole property. This has been permitted to enable a person 
to leave for a deserving relative or relatives, who are not entitled to 
inheritance, a part of the property. For instance, if there is an orphan 
grandson or a grand-daughter, or the widow of a son or an indigent brother or 
sister, or a brother's widow, or a nephew, or some other relative, who needs 
help, he may leave a part of the inheritance for such a one by means of his 
will. One is even allowed to leave by will a share for any deserving person or 
for public service. In short, the law regulates the distribution of two-thirds 
(or a little more) of one's inheritance and gives option for the disposal of the 
remaining (about one-third) by the special circumstances of one's own family., 
(which obviously vary of each individual). At the same time provision has been 
made to wrong done by a will to the heirs in any way. The members of the rectify 
that wrong by mutual consent or take the case to the Muslim will to suit in the 
case redress any family may judge for redress. For further explanation, see my 
book: Yatim Potay Ki Warasat. <br><br>21This is the answer to all those foolish 
people who do not understand the wisdom of the Divine Law of inheritance, and in 
their folly propose amendments to it in order to make up for "the deficiency" in 
the Law. <br><br>22In case the deceased leaves behind children, his wife or 
wives will be entitled to only one-eighth of the inheritance, and if he dies 
childless, she or they will he entitled to one-fourth of the whole and this 
one-fourth or one-eighth will be divided equally among all of them. <br><br>23If 
there he any other heir, he shall get share out of the remaining 5/6 or 2/3, as 
the case may be; otherwise the deceased will have the right to make his will 
about the whole of the remaining 5/6 or 2/3.All the commentators are agreed that 
in this verse brothers and sisters refer to half-brothers and half-sisters from 
the side of the mother alone. The rule of inheritance about real brothers and 
real sisters and half-brothers and half-sisters from the side of the father is 
given at the end of the Surah. <br><br>24The will shall be considered as 
injurious if it affects adversely the rights of the lawful heirs and the debt 
will be injurious if the testator acknowledges a debt which he has not actually 
taken or plays some trick to deprive the rightful heirs of their due shares. 
Such a thing has been declared as one of the most heinous sins according to a 
Tradition. Another Tradition of the Holy Prophet says, "There may be a person, 
who, throughout his whole life, does deeds that deserve Paradise, but who on the 
eve of his death makes an injurious will and thus in the end he does an act that 
deserves Hell." Though such an injury is a heinous sin in any case, the warning 
has specially been given about it in connection with a person who has neither 
children nor parents to inherit his property. This is because such a one is more 
prone to squander his property in order to deprive comparatively distant 
relatives. <br><br>25The attribute of Allah that He is All-Knowing, has been 
mentioned here for two reasons. First, it is to warn the people that none can 
escape the consequences of a breach of His Law, for, He has knowledge of 
everything. Second, it is to convince people that the shares of inheritance 
appointed by Allah are absolutely right, for Allah knows better than they in 
what lies their good. The other attribute that He is Lenient has been mentioned 
to show that the Laws of .Allah are not harsh but are so lenient that they do 
not put the people to hardship.<br><br>25aThis stern warning has been given to 
save people from the eternal torture of Hell, which they will suffer if they 
change the law of inheritance or break other legal limits prescribed by Allah in 
His Book. It is a pity that in spite of this stern warning the Muslims changed 
and broke the Law of Allah with the same impudence as shown by the Jews. The 
transgressions against this law of inheritance are an open rebellion against 
Allah. They deprive women of their share of inheritance; they discard the Law of 
Allah and adopt the Law of primo-geniture or of joint family system instead: 
whenever it suits their whims and interests they make the share of the male and 
the female equal in order to rectify the Law of Allah. The latest rebellion 
against the Law is that some Muslim States have followed the West and imposed 
"Death Duties" which implies that the State is also an heir whom Allah had 
forgotten to mention. As a matter of fact, the state is entitled to an 
inheritance only if the deceased leaves behind an unclaimed property or himself 
allots a portion of it to the state by his will.<br><br>26In both these verses 
(15-16j, punishment for fornication was prescribed for the first time in Islam. 
According to verse 15, the guilty women were to be kept in confinement till 
further order, and according to verse I G both the male and the female guilty of 
fornication were to be punished, that is rebuked. disgraced, beaten, etc. 
Afterwards this punishment was altered by verse 2 of Surah An-Nur (XXIV). Now 
both the male and the female are to be scourged with one hundred stripes each.<br>
<br>This gradual enforcement of the criminal law was based on sound practical 
wisdom. At that tithe the Arabs were not accustomed to live under a settled 
government with a regular system of law and judiciary. Therefore it might have 
unwise and too much for them, if the Islamic State had imposed on them its 
complete system of criminal laws all at once. That is why at first the sort of 
punishment contained in these two verses was enforced acid then gradually 
stricter punishments were prescribed for fornication. theft, slander, etc., and 
finally that complete system of law was evolved which was in force during the 
time of the Holy Prophet and his rightly guided successors.<br><br>The seeming 
difference in these two verses has misled commentator Suddi to the conclusion 
that verse I S prescribed the punishment for married women and verse I G for 
unmarried men and women. Obviously, this flimsy commentary is not supported by 
any sound argument. Likewise, the commentary of Abu Muslim Isfahani that verse 
15 is about the un-natural crime between two females and verse I G about the 
un-natural crime between two males is also wrong. The Qur'an is concerned only 
with the fundamental principles of law and morality: therefore it only discusses 
those problems which are confronted in normal life and does not concern itself 
with the ones that are met with under abnormal circumstances. These latter 
problems, as they arise, are left for the people to decide according to their 
insight. That is why, when after the death of the Holy Prophet the case of 
unnatural crime between two males was brought before the Companions, none of 
them turned to these verses for its decision. <br><br>27The word taubah means 
'to turn back' and 'to turn to'. When a person feels sorry for his sin and turns 
back from it, he may be likened to a runaway slave who comes back to his master. 
This is his taubah. When the master accepts his repentance, he turns to him 
kindly and forgives him. In Arabic this is his taubah to his servant. In this 
verse Allah has stated these two aspects of taubah. He says, "I turn only to 
those servants of Mine, who, if they commit some un-intentional sin through 
ignorance, turn to Me for forgiveness as soon as they realize their folly. For 
such repentance, the door of My forgiveness is ever open. It is, however, not so 
for those who persist in sin throughout their lives without the least fear of 
Allah and offer repentance only when death confronts them". The Holy Prophet 
says that Allah accepts the repentance of a person only up to the time, when 
there appears no sign of death. It is obvious that after the time of test has 
expired, no chance is left for him to turn back from sin. Likewise, if a person 
is dying as a disbeliever and seeing with his own eyes the other world, contrary 
to his expectations, the question of his repentance does not arise at all.<br>
<br>28This means that the widow of the deceased should not be regarded as a part 
of his inheritance. After the death of the husband, his widow is quite free to 
live wherever she likes and to marry whomever she chooses after the expiry of 
her term. <br><br>29That is, "You may hurt them for immoral conduct but not for 
grabbing their wealth." <br><br>30If the wife is not beautiful or has some other 
defect that might not be to the husband's liking, it is not right that he should 
make up his mind to get rid of her at once without any further consideration. He 
should behave coolly and patiently. She may have some other redeeming qualities 
that may be more conducive to a happy married life than beautiful looks. It is 
just possible that the discovery of those qualities might change his repulsion 
at first sight into attraction. In the same way, sometimes it so happens that in 
the beginning of married life, the husband takes a dislike to something in the 
wife and feels a repulsion towards her but if he is patient with her and lets 
her show her better side fully, he himself realizes that her good qualities more 
than compensate for her shortcomings. "therefore it is not right for the husband 
to cut off his relations with his wife without a good deal of thinking. Divorce 
is the very last thing to which one may resort as a necessary social surgery and 
that, too, only when it becomes absolutely inevitable. The Holy Prophet says 
that of all the lawful things, divorce is the most reprehensible thing in the 
sight of Allah. In another Tradition, he admonishes, An-Nisa "Enter into 
marriage and divorce not, for Allah does not approve of such men and women as 
divorce and marry for mere sexual enjoyment."<br><br>31"Solemn pledge" is the 
marriage bond on the guarantee of which a woman gives herself up to a man. 
Therefore, if the man breaks that pledge of his own accord, he has no right to 
get back what he gave her as dower at the time of making that pledge. (Please 
see E.N.251, Al-Baqarah, also). <br><br>32While forbidding the wrong ways of 
`ignorance', the Holy Qur'an usually ends the instruction with such words as: 
"though what has happened in the past is excepted." It has two meanings in view. 
First, that no action will be taken in regard to those wrong things that one did 
in ignorance, provided that one mended ones ways and gave them up after the 
receipt of a particular Commandment. Second, that those words meant to give 
reassurance that the new instructions had no retrospective effect. For instance, 
if a person had married his step-mother before it was declared to be unlawful, 
according to these words, the offspring of all such previous marriages did not 
automatically become illegitimate by this newly declared prohibition so as to 
deprive them of their share of inheritance. Likewise if some from of trade had 
been made unlawful, it did not mean that all the previous transactions in that 
form had become null and void, and that one would have to return all the wealth 
earned in that way or that it had become completely unlawful. <br><br>
33According to the Islamic Law, it is a criminal offense and is within the 
jurisdiction of the police. Some Traditions related in Abu-Da'ud, Nasa'i and 
Musnad Ahmad are to the effect that the Holy Prophet confiscated their 
properties and sentenced to death those who married their step-mothers. 
According to another "Tradition, related by Ibn Majah from Ibn `Abbas, the Holy 
Prophet enunciated this fundamental law: "Anyone who commits fornication with 
any of the forbidden relations should be put to death." The experts on Muslim 
Law, however, differ in regard to this matter. While Imam Ahmad is of the 
opinion that such a criminal ,should be put to death and his property 
confiscated, Imam Abu Hanifah, (maw Malik and lmam Shafi 'i are of the opinion 
that if a person commits fornication with anyone of the prohibited relations, he 
should be punished for the offense of fornication and if he marries such a one, 
he should be given an exemplary punishment for this heinous sin.<br><br>34This 
prohibition applies both to the real mother and to the step-mother and both are 
unlawful. It also applies to the mother of the father and to the mother of the 
mother.<br><br>Experts have differed as to whether the woman with whom the 
father has had illicit relations is also unlawful for the son or not. Some of 
the earlier jurists do not consider her unlawful, but some others not only 
consider her unlawful for the son but also the woman whom the father has touched 
lustfully with the hand. There has also been a difference of opinion as to 
whether the woman with whom the son has had an illicit relation is unlawful for 
the father and whether the man with whom the mother or the daughter has had 
illicit relation becomes unlawful for both the mother and the daughter. There 
have been lengthy controversies concerning the legal niceties of this matter, 
but a little thinking will show that the existence of a wife who is also coveted 
by the husband's father or his son, or whose mother or daughter is also coveted 
by the husband himself, cannot bode well for a righteous society. Divine Law in 
this matter does not tolerate the legal hair splitting on the basis of which 
fine distinctions are made between marriage and after marriage, touching with 
the hand and casting of looks, etc. The simple thing is that in family life 
existence of sexual relations of the father and the son with one and the same 
woman, or of the mother and the daughter with one and the same man, is bound to 
corrupt the family, and the Divine Law cannot tolerate it. This is supported by 
the following two Traditions of the Holy Prophet:<br><br>(1) "The mother and the 
daughter of the woman become unlawful for the man who cast a look at her sexual 
organs."<br><br>(2) "God does not like even to look at a man who casts a gaze at 
the sexual organs of the mother and of her daughter." <br><br>35The prohibition 
about daughter also applies to the daughter of the son and the daughter of the 
daughter. There is, however, a difference of opinion in regard to a girl born of 
an illicit relationship. Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik and lmam Ahmad-bin-Hanbal 
(may Allah bless them all) are of the opinion that she too is unlawful like the 
lawful daughter, but Imam Shafi 'i does not consider an illegitimate daughter 
unlawful. But the very idea is repugnant that one should marry a girl about whom 
one has the knowledge that she is of one's own seed.<br><br>36This applies to 
the real sister as well as to the foster sisters from the father's and the 
mother's side. <br><br>37All these relations are prohibited, irrespective of 
whether they are real or step from the father's side or from the mother's side. 
The sister of the father or mother, whether real or step, is unlawful for the 
son. Similarly the daughters of the brothers and sisters whether they are real 
or step are unlawful for a person like his own real daughter. <br><br>38The 
consensus of opinion is that the woman who suckled a boy or a girl should be 
treated as the real mother and her husband as the real father with regard to 
this prohibition. All those relations that have been made unlawful in respect of 
the real mother and real father are also prohibited in respect of the foster 
mother who has suckled and in respect .of her husband. This is based on a 
Tradition of the Holy Prophet which is to this effect: "Suckling makes unlawful 
what blood makes unlawful. " There is, however, a difference of opinion as to 
the minimum quantity of milk that is suckled. According to Imam Abu Hanifah and 
Imam Malik, if the child suckles milk equal to that minimum quantity that breaks 
the fast, the woman shall be treated as its real mother for marriage relations. 
But Imam Ahmad is of the opinion that the prohibition shall take place if the 
child suckles the woman at least three times and according to Imam Shafi `i at 
least five times. There is also a difference of opinion as to the age of the 
child at the time of suckling that brings prohibition. Below are given the 
opinions of the jurists:<br><br>(1) Hadrat Umm Salamah, Ibn `Abbas, Zuhri, Hasan 
Basri, Qatadah, `Ikrimah, and Auza`i are of the opinion that if the child is 
suckled during the period when it has not yet been weaned and it lives only on 
suckling, the prohibition shall be effective; but if it is suckled after it has 
been weaned, it will not apply; for this is like drinking water. There is also a 
saying of Hadrat `Ali to the same effect.<br><br>(2) Hadrat `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud, 
Abu Hurairah and Ibn `Umar (Allah be pleased with them) are of the opinion that 
the prohibition will be effective if the child is suckled at any time up to the 
age of two. Imam Shaafi `i, Imam Ahmad, Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad and Sufyan 
Thauri from among the jurists also agree to this. There is also a saying of Imam 
Abu Hanifah to the same effect. Imam Malik also agrees to this, but he says that 
the prohibition shall apply even if a month or two exceeds the time limit of two 
years.<br><br>(3) According to a well-known saying of Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam 
Zufar, the prohibition shall apply if the child is suckled during the suckling 
period, which extends `up to the age of two years and a half<br><br>(4) Hadrat 
'A' ishah is of the opinion that the prohibition shall apply, if one is suckled 
at any time whatsoever, irrespective of age. An authentic saying of Hadrat `Ali 
also supports the same and 'Urwah bin Zubair, 'Ata', Laith bin Sa'd and Ibn Hazm 
from among the jurists have adopted the same opinion. <br><br>39There is a 
difference of opinion as to whether the mere event of nikah (marriage ceremony) 
with a woman makes her mother unlawful or not. Imam Abu Hanifah, Malik, Ahmad 
and Shafi `i are of the opinion that this alone makes her mother unlawful but 
Hadrat "Ali is of the opinion that unless one has had any conjugal relation with 
her, her mother shall not become unlawful for him. <br><br>40The wife's daughter 
is unlawful in any case, whether she has been brought up in the house of the 
step-father or not. Allah has used these words only to show the great delicacy 
of the relation. There is almost a consensus of opinion among the jurists that 
the step-daughter is unlawful in any case whether one has brought her up or not.<br>
<br>41The significance of "who are from your loins" is that the widows or the 
divorced wives of those whom one has adopted as sons are not unlawful. The 
prohibition applies only to the wives of the sons who are of one's own seed. 
Likewise, the wives of the grandsons are also unlawful. <br><br>42Likewise it is 
unlawful to keep the aunt and her real niece as wives at one and the same time. 
The principle is that no two women who would have been unlawful for each other 
if one of them had been a man should be kept as wives at one and the same time.
<br><br>43That is, "No action will be taken for the transgression committed 
during the days of 'ignorance', by keeping two sisters as wives at one and the 
same time." (Please also see E.N. 32 above). However, one shall have to divorce 
one of the two sisters thus married during the time of un-belief after one has 
become a Muslim. <br><br>44That is, those women who become prisoners of war, 
while their unbelieving husbands are left behind in the War Zone, are not 
unlawful because their marriage ties are broken by the fact that they have come 
from the War Zone into the Islamic Zone. It is lawful to marry such women, and 
it is also lawful for those, in whose possession they are, to have sexual 
relations with them. There is, however, a difference of opinion as to whether 
such a woman is lawful, if her husband is also taken a prisoner along with her. 
Imam Abu Hanifah and those of his way of thinking are of the opinion that the 
marriage tie of such a pair would remain intact but Imam Malik and Shafi 'i, are 
of the opinion that it would also break.<br><br>As there exist many 
misunderstandings in the minds of the people concerning the slave-girls taken as 
prisoners of war, the following should be carefully studied:<br><br>(1) It is 
not lawful for a soldier to have conjugal relations with a prisoner of war as 
soon as she falls into his hands. The Islamic Law requires that all such women 
should be handed over to the government, which has the right to set them free or 
to ransom them, or to exchange them with the Muslim prisoners in the hands of 
the enemy, or distribute them among the soldiers. A soldier can cohabit only 
with that woman who has been formally given to him by the government.<br><br>(2) 
Even then, he shall have to wait for one monthly course before he can cohabit 
with her in order to ensure whether she is pregnant or not; otherwise it shall 
be unlawful to cohabit with her before delivery.<br><br>(3) It does not matter 
whether the female prisoner of war belongs to the people of the Book or not. 
Whatever her religion, she becomes lawful for the man to whom she is formally 
given.<br><br>(4) None but the one to own the slave-girl is given has the right 
to "touch her." The offspring of such a woman from his seed shall be his lawful 
children and shall have the same legal rights as are given by the Divine Law to 
the children from one's loins. After the birth of a child she cannot be sold as 
a slave-girl and shall automatically become free after her master's death.<br>
<br>(5) If the master marries his slave-girl with another man, he forfeits his 
conjugal rights over her, but retains other rights such as service from her.<br>
<br>(6) The maximum limit of four has not been prescribed for slave-girls as in 
the case of wives for the simple reason that the number of female prisoners of 
war is unpredictable. The lack of limit does by no means provide a license for 
the well-to-do people to buy any number of slave-girls for licentious purposes.<br>
<br>(7) The proprietary rights over a slave, male or female, as given to a 
person by the government are transferable like all other legal proprietary 
rights.<br><br>(8) The handing over of the proprietary rights over a slave-girl 
to a man formally by the government makes her as much lawful for him as the 
giving of the baud of a free woman to a man by her parents or guardian through 
nikah (marriage ceremony). Therefore, there is no reason why a man who does not 
hold marriage in detestation should hold sexual intercourse with a slave-girl in 
detestation.<br><br>(9) When once the government hands over the female prisoner 
of war to someone, it has no right whatever to take her back from him, just as 
the parent or guardian has no right to take back a woman after she is handed 
over to a man through nikah.<br><br>(10) It should also be noted well that if a 
military commander temporarily distributes female prisoners of war among the 
soldiers for sexual purposes, or permits them to have sexual relations for the 
time being, such an act shall be unlawful and there is absolutely no difference 
between this and fornication, and fornication is a crime according to the 
Islamic code. (For detailed discussion please refer to my books, Tafhimat II and 
Rasa `il-o-Masa 'il I).<br><br>45That is, "The social differences among the 
people are merely relative; otherwise all Muslims are equal. As a matter of 
fact, the thing that distinguishes one Muslim from another is the quality of his 
Faith, and that is not the monopoly of the higher ranks of society. It is just 
possible that a Muslim slave-girl is higher in rank in regard to belief and 
morality than a free woman of a high family. <br><br>46It should be kept in view 
that in this section (vv. 2425) the Arabic word muhsanat has been used in two 
different senses: (1) "wedded wives", enjoying the protection of their husbands; 
and (2) "free Muslim women" enjoying the protection of their families, even 
though they might not be married. This is important, because the lack of 
differentiation between these two meanings has given rise to a superficial 
complication. The Kharijites and those others who do not believe in the stoning 
of an adulterous woman have misconstrued this verse (25) to prove their own 
point of view. They argue that in this verse, the punishment prescribed for an 
adulterous married slave-girl is half of the punishment prescribed for a free 
"married" Muslim woman. If the punishment for an adulterous free married woman 
had been stoning to death, there could be no half of this punishment for a 
guilty slave-girl. Hence, this verse is, according to them, a conclusive proof 
that the punishment of stoning does not exist in Islam.<br><br>The fallacy of 
the above argument becomes obvious, if one uses common sense in the application 
of the appropriate meaning of muhsanat. In the case of the guilty slave-girl, it 
has been used in the sense of "married woman", enjoying the protection of the 
husband, as is plain from the subsequent clause; "after they have been fortified 
in wedlock". But in the case of the guilty Muslim woman, half of whose 
punishment is to be given, it means "free Muslim woman" enjoying the protection 
of her family, and does not mean a "free married Muslim woman", as has been 
misconstrued by the opponents of the punishment of stoning.<br><br>As regards 
the lighter punishment for an adulterous slave-girl than for a free Muslim 
woman, it is based on the fact that the latter enjoys double protection as 
compared with the former the protection of the family (even though she be 
unmarried) and the protection of the husband, which reinforces the protection of 
the family she already enjoys. In contrast to a free woman, a slave-girl does 
not enjoy any protection at all, if she is unmarried, and even after marriage 
her position does not become equal to that of an un-married free Muslim woman, 
for the latter enjoys the protection of her status, her family, her clan, etc. 
On the other hand, a slave-girl still remains, to some extent, under the bondage 
of slavery and has no protection of the family, clan, etc. Therefore, her 
punishment should be half of an un-married free woman and not half of a free 
married woman.<br><br>Furthermore this also shows that the punishment of one 
hundred stripes as prescribed in An-Nur, XXIV : 2, is for an un-married free 
Muslim woman guilty of fornication half of which has been prescribed here for a 
slave married girl. As for an adulterous married free woman she deserves capital 
punishment for this heinous crime because she enjoys the double protection of 
the family and of the husband, and that punishment is "stoning her to death." 
Though the Qur'an does not explicitly mention the punishment of stoning to 
death, it does indicate it in a subtle manner, which the Holy Prophet understood 
and enforced. And who else could understand the Qur'an better? <br><br>47The 
"concession" is to marry one of the slave-girls with the consent of her master 
if one cannot afford to marry a free Muslim woman. <br><br>48The "way" refer to 
all those instructions that have been given from the beginning of the Surah to 
this point, and to those already given in Al-Baqarah about cultural and social 
problems. Allah is telling the believers that it is His bounty that He is taking 
them out of the ways of "ignorance" and guiding them to the moral ways of good 
people, that have always been followed by the Prophets of every age and their 
pious followers. <br><br>49Those who intended to turn the believers back from 
the Right Way to the ways of error were the hypocrites, the ignorant people of 
the old ways, and the Jews living in the suburbs of Madinah The first two groups 
strongly disliked the changes that were being made to reform their centuries old 
prejudices, rites and customs. They were opposed to (a) the share of the 
daughters in inheritance; (b) the freedom of the widow from the restrictions 
placed on her by her husband's people, and to marry the husband of her liking 
after the expiry of the term, (c) the prohibition of marriage with step-mother, 
and with two real sisters simultaneously. They were averse to the reform of the 
institution of adoption which abolished the share of the adopted sons in 
inheritance and removed the restriction on the marriage of their divorced wives 
or their widows with their adopted fathers. These and such other reforms so 
upset the worshipers of the old traditions and customs that they cried 
themselves hoarse with protests against them. The mischief mongers criticized 
bitterly the Holy Prophet and incited the people against his person and his 
invitation. For instance, if there was a person who was born as a result of a 
marriage which had become unlawful by the application of the reformed laws, they 
would incite him by saying that he had been declared illegitimate by the Holy 
Prophet. Thus the foolish people were opposing the work of reform which was 
being carried out under Divine Guidance.<br><br>Then there were the Jews who 
were engaged in vicious propaganda against this reformative work which went 
against their self-made laws. They demanded that the Qur'an should declare these 
laws to be the Divine Laws, even though they had changed their very character 
and substance, by making fine and unnecessary distinctions, by introducing into 
it their own superstitious customs as laws, by imposing their own restrictions 
and hard conditions and making many lawful things unlawful. They, therefore, 
could not appreciate the simple rules and regulations that were being presented 
by the Qur'an. That is why their rabbis, scribes and common people did not 
accept the Qur'an as the Book of Allah. They were so upset by its reformative 
laws that they made each and every Commandment of the Qur'an the target of their 
criticism and opposed and rejected it.<br><br>For instance, the Jews considered 
the women utterly unclean during the menses. They would not take the meals 
cooked by them nor drink water touched by their hands nor even sit on the same 
carpet with them. In short, the women were practically made untouchables in 
their homes. As the Ansar had also adopted the same customs when the Holy 
Prophet migrated to Madinah, they asked him about the monthly course. In answer 
to this question, v. 222 of Al-Bagarah was sent down; accordingly the Holy 
Prophet instructed that during the monthly course only cohabitation was 
prohibited and all other relations with the women would remain the same as 
before. At this, the Jews raised a great hue and cry, saying, "This man is bent 
upon opposing us in everything ants making lawful what is unlawful with us and 
unlawful what is lawful with us." <br><br>50"Unlawful ways" include all the ways 
that are against the Islamic law and principles and are false and immoral.<br>
<br>"Business" comprises all those transactions that are carried out for profit, 
benefit, etc., as in trade, commerce, industry, etc., by which one satisfies the 
needs of another who pays for the service rendered.<br><br>"Mutual consent" 
implies that those transactions should be carried out by mutual agreement and 
not by coercion or fraud. For instance, although apparently there is a mutual 
agreement in interest and bribery,. yet it is obvious that the needy party is 
compelled by circumstances to agree to such transactions. In gambling also each 
participant is deluded by the false hope of "winning". Neither would agree to 
gamble if he knew that he would lose. The same is true of every case of 
transaction which involves fraud. The defrauded one agrees under the 
misunderstanding that there is no fraud in it. If he knew that he was being 
deceived, he would never agree to this. <br><br>51"Do not kill yourselves" may 
be complementary to the preceding sentence t or may, in itself, be an 
independent sentence. In the first case, it would mean that the one who devours 
unlawfully the property of others; does in fact lead himself to his own 
destruction, for such an evil deed ruins the social order to such an extent that 
ultimately he himself cannot escape its evil consequences, and in the Here after 
most surely he incurs severe punishment.<br><br>In the second case, it would 
mean, "Do not kill each other", or "Do not commit suicide". Allah has used such 
comprehensive words that in the context they occur, they imply all the three 
senses, and all these are correct. <br><br>52That is, "Allah is your well-wisher 
and wishes you well: it is only His compassion that He forbids you such deeds as 
cause your ruin." <br><br>53That is, "We are not narrow-minded and prejudiced 
that We should take Our servants to task for each and every trivial offense. But 
if you commit wicked and heinous sins, then you shall have to render an account 
of the trivial offenses as well. "<br><br>Here it will be worthwhile to 
understand the basic differences between the "heinous sins" and the "trivial 
offenses". As far as I have understood from a critical study of the Qur'an and 
the Sunnah (and the correct and right knowledge is only with Allah), I have 
.come to the conclusion that the following three things make a sin heinous:<br>
<br>(1) The violation of the rights of Allah, or of parents, or of other human 
beings, or one's own rights. The wickedness of the sin increases in proportion 
to the sanctity of the right that is violated. That is why the Qur'an calls a 
sin Zulm (iniquity) and declares shirk to be a gross iniquity.<br><br>(2) A sin 
becomes heinous, if it is committed to defy the Divine Laws. This is because the 
offender deliberately, boldly and shamelessly discards the Commandments and 
Prohibitions of Allah and intentionally does that which He prohibits, merely for 
the sake of disobedience, and impudently does not do that which He has 
commanded. The gravity of this sin increases in proportion to the impudence that 
is shown towards Allah in disobeying and discarding His Law. That is why the 
Qur'an calls sin fisq (disobedience) and ma` siyat (arrogance).<br><br>(3) The 
violation of those relations and the cutting off of those connections on the 
unification and integrity of which depends the peace of human life, makes a sin 
heinous whether these relations are between man and Allah or between man and 
man. The gravity of the sin of violation or the cutting off of a connection 
increases in proportion to the importance of the relation, and to the security 
contained in it. For instance, fornication in its different forms is in itself a 
heinous sin, for it corrupts human society. But in some forms it becomes far 
more heinous than in others. The sin of adultery committed by a married man is 
far more heinous than that committed by an unmarried man. Likewise, adultery 
with a married woman is a far greater sin than fornication with an unmarried 
woman. In the same way, sexual intercourse with the womenfolk of a neighbour is 
far more heinous than with others and incest with mother, sister or daughter 
become the most heinous sin conceivable because of the security and sanctity the 
relation provides. For the same reason the sin committed in the mosque is far 
more wicked than elsewhere. In the above instances, the difference in the 
gravity of the same sin is due to the difference in the nature of the sanctity 
of the relations and the security contained in them. This is why, sin is also 
called fujur (violation of relations).<br><br>54In this verse Allah has given a 
very important moral instruction, which, if observed, would bring great peace in 
the troubled social life of today. Allah has taught people not to be covetous 
for and be envious of the possessions of others, for He has not; in His wisdom, 
created all men alike. But for this disparity life would have become dull.<br>
<br>As Allah has perfect knowledge of everything, He has created one beautiful 
and another ugly. He has given to one a melodious voice and to another a harsh 
voice. He has made one of strong physique and another of weak constitution. He 
has endowed one with some good qualities of mind and body and another with other 
qualities. He has created one in straitened and another in opulent 
circumstances. He has provided one with ample resources and another with scanty 
ones. A little thinking will convince a person that the variety in human culture 
is due only to those very differences and distinctions which are based on wisdom 
and perfect knowledge. That is why chaos of one sort or the other results 
whenever people artificially try either to aggravate these differences and 
distinctions or to eliminate them totally. The human tendency to envy others 
because of their superiority in anything generates jealousy, cut-throat 
competition, enmity, class struggle and the like with the resulting 
consequences. One who suffers from such a mentality tries to grab unlawfully 
that which Allah has not given him through His bounty. In this verse Allah has 
advised the Muslims to avoid such a mentality and keep themselves free from 
envying others. One should, however, pray to Allah for His bounty, for He will 
bestow upon him whatever He considers proper for him, because He has perfect 
knowledge of everything.<br><br>As regards "The men shall have their due share 
according to what they have earned, and the women shall have their share 
according to what they have earned," in my opinion it means that women should 
not envy men and men should not envy women because of any superiority the one 
has over the other because of Allah's bounty. They should make full use of 
whatever Allah has given them and rest assured that each one will get one's due 
share according to what good or evil one earns and of the same quality that one 
deserves.<br><br>55The Arabs would enter into agreements of friendship and 
brotherhood with each other and on that score were entitled to the inheritance 
of each other. Thus, a god-son became heir of his god-father. Here this custom 
of "ignorance" has been abolished, and it has been enjoined that the inheritance 
should be divided among the heirs according to the law prescribed by Allah. They 
are, however, allowed to give to such people, whatever they like during their 
lifetime. <br><br>56The Arabic word qawam or qawam stands for a person who is 
responsible for the right conduct, safeguard and maintenance of the affairs of 
an individual, an institution or an organization. Thus, than is governor, 
director, protector and manager of the affairs of women. <br><br>57Men are 
superior to women in the sense that they have been endowed with certain natural 
qualities and powers that have not been given to women or have been given in a 
less degree, and not in the sense that they are above them in honor and 
excellence. Man has been made qawam (governor) of the family because of his 
natural qualities and woman has been made his dependent for her own safety and 
protection because of her natural drawbacks. <br><br>58A tradition of the Holy 
Prophet is the best commentary on this, He said, "The best wife is the one who 
pleases you when you see her; who obeys your orders and who guards your property 
and her own honor when you are not at home. "<br><br>In this connection, it is 
necessary to give a warning. Obedience to Allah is of far greater importance 
than obedience to the husband and has precedence over it. 'therefore, it is the 
duty of the wife to refuse to obey her husband, if and when he orders her to do 
a thing which amounts to Allah's disobedience. In that case it shall be a sin to 
obey him. On the contrary, if the husband orders her not to observe a certain 
voluntary religious devotion, she must obey him, otherwise her devotion will not 
be accepted. <br><br>59If the wife is defiant and does trot obey her husband or 
does not guard his rights, three measures have been mentioned, but it does not 
mean that all the three are to be taken at one and the same time. Though these 
have been permitted, they are to be administered with a sense of proportion 
according to the nature and extent of the offense. if a mere light admonition 
proves effective, there is no need to resort to a severer step. As to a beating, 
the Holy Prophet allowed it very reluctantly and even then did not like it. But 
the fact is that there are certain women who do not mend their ways without a 
beating. In such a case, the Holy Prophet has instructed that she would not be 
beaten on the face, or cruelly, or with anything which might leave a mark on the 
body.<br><br>60"The two sides" refers both to the arbiters and to the spouses. 
Reconciliation can be effected in every quarrel, if the parties concerned desire 
it and if the arbiters try to effect it sincerely and justly. <br><br>61In this 
verse, a plan has been put forward for settling disputes between husband and 
wife within the family. An effort should be made to effect a reconciliation 
before resorting to a court of law or making the final breach. The plan is to 
appoint one arbiter from the family of each spouse for this purpose. The two 
should probe into the real cause or causes of the dispute and then try to find a 
way out of it. Of course, the relatives are best qualified for it, knowing as 
they do the true conditions of the spouses.<br><br>Allah has left it unanswered 
as to who should appoint the arbiters so that each spouse may appoint one 
arbiter from his or her relatives, if they desire to patch up their differences, 
or the leaders of the two families may take the initiative and entrust the work 
of reconciliation to two arbiters, or if the case goes to the court, it may 
appoint two arbiters before taking any action.<br><br>There is a difference of 
opinion regarding the powers of the arbiters. According to the Hanafi and the 
Shafi `i schools of thought, the arbiters are not authorized to pass any final 
decree but may recommend measures for reconciliation, which tray be accepted or 
rejected by the spouses. Of course, if the spouses themselves authorize them to 
effect divorce or khula' or take any other measure, then they shall be bound to 
accept their decision. Hasan Basri, Qatadah and some other jurists are of the 
opinion that the arbiters are authorized to enforce reconciliation but not 
separation. Ibn `Abbas, Said bin Jubair, Ibrahim Nakha 'i, Sha 'bi, Muhammad bin 
Sirin and some other jurists are of the opinion that the arbiters have full 
authority to enforce their decision about reconciliation or separation whichever 
they consider to be proper.<br><br>Caliph Uthman and Caliph 'Ali used to 
authorize the arbiters appointed by theta with full powers to effect 
reconciliation or separation as required by the circumstances. For instance, 
when the case of 'Aqil, son of Abu Talib, and his wife Fatimah, daughter of 'Utbah 
bin Rabi'ah, was brought in the court of Caliph Uthman, he appointed as arbiter 
Ibn 'Abbas from the family of the husband and Mu'aviyah bin Abi Sufyan from the 
family of the wife and told them that they ware authorized to cause separation 
between them, if required by circumstances. Likewise, Caliph `Ali appointed 
arbiters in a similar case and authorized them to effect reconciliation between 
the spouses or separate them. This shows that the arbiters as such do not 
possess judicial powers, but if at the tithe of their appointment, the authority 
concerned empowers them with judicial powers, their decision shall be binding 
and enforced like other judicial decisions.<br><br>62"Assahib-i-bil -janb" as 
used in the Text may imply an intimate friend and also a person who accompanies 
one at any time. For instance, he may happen to accompany one in the street, or 
be a fellow customer at a shop, or be a fellow passenger in the bus or in the 
railway train, etc. Even such a temporary neighborhood requires a civilized and 
noble person to treat the companion as far as possible kindly, and scrupulously 
avoid giving him any sort of trouble. <br><br>63"To conceal the bounty of Allah" 
is to live in a way as if Allah has not bestowed His bounty upon him. For 
instance, a rich person conceals Allah's bounty, if he lives below his standard: 
neither spends money on his own person nor on the members of his family nor on 
the needy nor for any other good work. In short, his appearance would show him 
to be in very straitened circumstances. Obviously that is gross ingratitude to 
Allah.<br><br>A Tradition of the Holy Prophet says, "When Allah bestows His 
bounty on anyone, He likes that he should show it". That is, he should live the 
life of a well-to-do person who spends money on food, dress, house, furniture, 
etc., according to his means, and also in the way of Allah in order to show the 
blessing on him. <br><br>64That is, the Prophet of every age will give evidence 
in the Court of Allah, saying: "Lord, I duly delivered Your message to my people 
and taught them the right way of life and the right mode of thought and practice 
which You taught me." Last of all, the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's 
peace and blessings) will give this same evidence regarding the people of his 
term. and his term, according to the Qur'an extends from the time of his 
appointment as Prophet till Resurrection. (E.N. 69, Al-`Imran) <br><br>65This is 
the second Commandment about drinking. The first Commandment (Al-Baqarah: 219) 
was that drinking is an evil thing and Allah does not approve of it. Accordingly 
some of the Muslims began to refrain from it from that time. The majority of 
them, however, did not give it up and often offered the Prayer in a state of 
intoxication and made blunders in their recitations. Probably, this second 
Commandment came in the beginning of A.H. 4 and prohibited the offering of the 
Prayer while one was drunk. As a result they changed the timings of their 
drinking so as not to clash with the timings of the Prayers. Some time after 
this, the Commandment about total prohibition as contained in Al-Ma'idah: 90-91 
was sent down.<br><br>Incidentally, the word sukr (state of intoxication) as 
used in the Text also implies that this Commandment prohibits not only drinkig 
but every kind of intoxicant. Moreover, though every intoxicating thing is in 
itself unlawful, the offence of intoxication is doubled and becomes more 
heinous, when the Prayer is offered in such a state. <br><br>66For the same 
reason, the Holy Prophet has instructed that when one feels sleepy, and doses 
again and again during the Prayer, one should give up his Prayer and go to 
sleep.<br><br>Some people from this verse argue that the Prayer of the one who 
does not know the meaning of its Arabic Text, is no Prayer at all. But apart 
from the fact that it is an unnecessary hardship, the Arabic words of the Qur'an 
do not support this version. The Qur'an does not say, "unless you understand its 
meaning" or "unless you understand what you are saying" but it says "unless you 
know what you are saying". That is, one should be in his senses to know what he 
is uttering with his tongue lest he should recite, say, a poem, instead of the 
text of the Prayer. <br><br>67The Arabic word janabat literally means being far 
off and stranger, and the word ajnabi (stranger) is derived from the same root. 
As an Islamic term it refers to that state of uncleanliness and impurity that is 
caused by the emission of seed by sexual intercourse or in sleep because this 
makes a person stranger to cleanliness. <br><br>68A section of the jurists and 
commentators,such as 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Anas bin Malik, Hasan Basri and 
Ibrahim Nakha'i and others deduce from the words, "when passing on the way," 
that one should not enter a mosque in a state of "uncleanliness" except when one 
has to pass through it for some urgent piece of business. Another section of 
them, such as Hadrat 'Ali, Ibn 'Abbas, Said bin Jubair and some others conclude 
from this that if one becomes "unclean" when on a journey, one may cleanse 
oneself by wiping one's face and hands with pure dust, if water is not 
available. As regards entering a mosque in such a state of "uncleanliness", the 
latter section is of the opinion that one may sit in the mosque after performing 
his ablutions ( wudu). But there is almost a consensus of opinion that if one 
becomes "unclean" on a journey and water is not available for a bath, one may 
cleanse oneself with pure dust and offer the Prayer. However, the former section 
derives this opinion from the Traditions and the latter bases this concession on 
this part of verse 43. <br><br>69There is a difference of opinion as to 
implication of "if you have touched women." Hadrat 'Ali, Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Mesa 
Ash'ari, Ubaiyy Ibn Ka`b, Said bin Jubair, Hasan Basri and several other jurists 
are of the opinion that here "have touched" means "have had sexual intercourse". 
Imam Abu Hanifah and those of his way of thinking and Imam Sufyan Thauri have 
adopted the same interpretation. On the contrary, Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas`ud 
and 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and (according to some traditions) Hadrat `Umar also are 
of the opinion that the word "touched" actually means "touching with the hand" 
and Imam Shafi`i has adopted this version. Some jurists, such as Imam Malik, 
have adopted a middle course and expressed the opinion that if the touch between 
a man and a woman is of sexual nature, they shall have to make fresh ablutions 
for the Prayer but if. their bodies touch each others without any feeling of 
sensuality, there is nothing wrong in this. <br><br>70If one has to perform 
ablutions or take a bath before offering one's Salat and water is not available, 
one is allowed to resort to tayammum; or, if one is sick and there is a danger 
that the disease would worsen if one performs ablutions or takes a bath, one is 
allowed to resort to tayammum even if water is available.<br><br>Literally 
tayammum means "to turn to"; that is, one should turn to pure dust when water is 
not available, or if its use is harmful. There is a difference of opinion 
concerning the method of performing tayammum. The majority of the jurists, such 
as Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Shafi`i and Imam Malik, prescribe that one should 
strike one's hands on pure dust and wipe one's face with them; then one should 
again strike one's hands and wipe one's hands up to the elbows with them. This 
method has been prescribed by some Companions of the Holy Prophet and their 
followers such as Hadrat `Ali, `Abdullah bin `Umar, Hasan Basri, Sha'bi and 
Salim bin `Abdullah and others. But some jurists such as `Ata', Mak-hul, Auza`i 
and Ahmad bin Hanbal consider it enough to strike one's hands only once on pure 
dust and wipe the face and the hands up to the wrists and not up to the elbows. 
The Ahl-i-Hadith, in general, follow this method.<br><br>For the performance of 
tayammum, it is not essential only to strike one's hands on pure earth: any 
dusty thing or dry piece of earth suffices for this purpose. Some people object 
to this method of cleansing; they say, "How can one be cleansed by striking 
one's hands on dust and wiping the face and hands up to the elbows with these? 
Let them look upon this method from the psychological point of view. Tayammum 
helps keep alive the feelings of cleansing oneself and of the sanctity of the 
Prayer, even if one is not able to use water for a long time. Thus, a Muslim 
will always keep in view the rules of purity and cleanliness prescribed by the 
Islamic Code and will scrupulously be mindful of his state of cleanliness and 
purity for the observance of the Prayer.<br><br>71About the scholars of the 
people of the Book the Qur'an at many places has used words to the effect: "They 
have been given a part of the knowledge of the Scripture". These words have been 
used because the scholars had actually lost a portion of their Scriptures and 
had become strangers to the spirit and the real aim and object of the portion 
left with them. The only interest they took, in these was confined to polemical 
controversies, minor details of Commandments and philosophical subtleties of 
creed. That is why they were ignorant of the true nature of religion and were 
void of its essence, though they were called "Divines" and "Rabbis" and were the 
acknowledged leaders of their community. <br><br>72The words used are: "who have 
become Jews" and not "who are Jews," for originally they were "Muslims" just as 
the community of every Prophet is Muslim. Then afterwards they degenerated and 
became merely "Jews". <br><br>73They were guilty of perversion in three ways: 
(1) They effected changes in the words of the Scriptures; (2) they distorted the 
meanings of the text with false interpretations, and (3) they would sit in the 
assemblies of the Holy Prophet and his Companions and afterwards make false 
reports of what they heard there in order to create mischief against them by 
distortion. They would thus spread misunderstandings about Islam and pervert 
people from joining the Islamic Community. <br><br>74That is, when the 
Commandments of Allah are recited to them, they 'say. sami`na (we have heard) 
aloud and `asaina (we have rejected) in a low voice, of they pronounce the word 
ata `na (we have obeyed) with such a twist of the tongue that it sounds as `asaina.<br>
<br>75During their talk with the Holy Prophet, they would invite his attention, 
saying, Isma `a (please listen to us), and would add ghaira musma ` in, which 
has several meanings. It may mean : "You are such a respectable man that one 
cannot utter any word before you against your will", but it may also imply : 
"You are not worthy that one may speak to you." Another meaning is : "May Allah 
make you deaf!"<br><br>76For this please refer to E.N. 105, Al-Baqarah.<br><br>
77Please refer to E.N. 2, AI -i-`Imran. <br><br>78Please refer to E.N.'s 82 and 
83, Al-Baqarah. <br><br>79The people of the Book have been admonished for being 
guilty of shirk, though they professed to believe in the Prophets and the 
revealed Books. <br><br>80This does not mean that if one refrains from shirk, 
then one may freely indulge in other sins. This is merely to bring home to them 
the gravity of this heinous sin, which they regarded as a trivial thing. That is 
why the warning has been given that shirk is the most heinous of all sins; so 
much so that this is the only sin for which forgiveness is not possible.<br><br>
The Jewish Rabbis were very particular in the observance of minor laws;nay, they 
spent most of their time in measuring and weighing those regulations which were 
not explicitly mentioned in their Scriptures but were derived from them. On the 
contrary, they regarded shirk as a trivial matter: they not only themselves were 
involved in it but they did not try to save their community from .shirk and acts 
of shirk. Accordingly, they did not consider that there was anything wrong in 
entering into alliance with mushrik communities and helping them. <br><br>
81Literally, jibt means an unreal, baseless and useless thing. In the Islamic 
terminology, sorcery, magic, divination, omen-taking and the like superstitious 
practices are called jibt. A Tradition of the Holy Prophet says, "Taking omens 
from the sounds of the birds and the footmarks of the animals and all other 
methods of divination are jibt." Thus jibt is the equivalent of superstition.
<br><br>82Please refer to E.N.'s 286 and 288, Al-Baqarah. <br><br>83The Jewish 
Rabbis had gone so low in their opposition to Islam that' they regarded the 
followers of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) as more misguided than even 
the Arab Mushriks, and declared the latter to be more rightly guided though it 
was quite obvious to them that on one side there was the worship of One God 
without any tinge of shirk, and on the other, idolatry white had been . 
thoroughly condemned in the Bible. <br><br>84That is, "Do they possess any 
portion of Divine Authority that they are sitting in judgment on the case to 
decide who is rightly guided and who is not?" "Had they any part in it, they 
would never have given a farthing to anyone else because they are so narrow 
minded that they are not even ready to acknowledge the Truth"<br><br>It may also 
imply: Do they possess the kingdom of a country from which others are demanding 
a share, and they are finding it hard to part with it? What is being demanded of 
them is merely the acknowledgment of the Truth, and this they are refusing on 
account of jealousy. <br><br>85Here they are being rebuked for showing jealousy 
against the Holy Prophet and his followers because they were blessed with 
Allah's Bounty (Prophethood) for which they themselves were looking forward in 
spite of being unworthy of it. Instead of showing regret for their own 
unworthiness which caused the loss of the Bounty, they were showing resentment 
against the Holy Prophet who had by His Bounty brought about the greatest 
spiritual, moral and intellectual revolution in Arabia with its resulting 
leadership and greatness. It was their jealousy that was urging them to side 
with the mushrik, and to Criticize the Muslims. <br><br>86"Mulk-i-azim " refers 
to the leadership and guidance of the world and to the superiority over other 
nations that is gained by putting into practice the knowledge and wisdom of the 
Divine Book. <br><br>87It must be kept in mind that this is the answer to the 
jealous talk of the children of Israel. It implies this: "Why do you feel 
jealous of the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be peace) and his followers? You are 
the descendants of the Prophet Abraham (upon whom be peace) and so are the 
children of Ishmael his descendants. We promised the Prophet Abraham that We 
would bestow leadership of the world upon those of his descendants who would 
follow the Book and the Wisdom sent dawn by Us. At first We sent down the Book 
and the Wisdom to you, who belong to one line of his descendants, but you proved 
incapable of this. Now We have sent down the same to the children of Ishmael the 
second line of .Abraham's descendants. They have accepted it, believed in it and 
followed it practically. Now answer for yourselves whether you have any ground 
of jealousy and resentment against the children of Ishmael.<br><br>88Here the 
Muslims have been fore-warned that they should avoid those evils in which the 
children of Israel were involved. Their basic error was that during their 
degeneration they entrusted the positions of trust to incompetent people. They 
began to entrust positions of responsibility and religious and political 
leadership to inefficient, narrow-minded, immoral, dishonest and wicked people. 
As a result, the whole community became corrupt. The Muslims are being cautioned 
against this evil and enjoined to entrust positions of responsibility to 
qualified and competent people of good moral character.<br><br>Another evil that 
was prevalent among the Jews was injustice. They had lost the very sense and 
spirit of justice and become utterly unjust, openly dishonest, and sinfully 
obdurate and would commit acts of gross injustice without any pangs of 
conscience. The Muslims were personally having a bitter experience of this. The 
Jews were siding with the idolatrous Quraish against the Believers in one God 
though the lives of the two clearly showed "who was more rightly guided."On the 
one side, they saw the pure lives of the Holy Prophet and his followers; on the 
other, they witnessed the immoral lives of their enemies, who buried their 
daughters alive, married their step mothers and went round the Ka`bah in naked 
state. Still these "people of the Book" preferred the idolatrous people to the. 
Believers and brazen-facedly declared that the former were more rightly guided 
than the latter. Allah warns the Believers against this sort of injustice and 
enjoins them always to say what is just and right and judge between the people 
with justice whether they be friends or foes.<br><br>89This verse is the basis 
of the whole religious, cultural and political system of Islam and is the first 
and foremost article of the constitution of an Islamic State. It lays down 
permanently the following fundamental principles:<br><br>(1) In the Islamic 
system, Allah is the real Authority who must be obeyed. A Muslim is first of all 
the servant of Allah; all his other capacities come after this. Therefore, a 
Muslim as an individual and the Muslims as a community owe their first loyalty 
to Allah and they must subordinate all other loyalties to this. Allegiance and 
obedience to anyone else shall be acknowledged only if these are not opposed to 
the allegiance and obedience to Allah but are subordinate to it. All other 
allegiances that are opposed to this basic allegiance shall be broken asunder. 
The Holy Prophet has explained the same thing in a Tradition: "There is no 
obedience to any of His creatures in what involves disobedience to the Creator."<br>
<br>(2) The second fundamental principle of the Islamic system is allegiance and 
obedience to the Holy Prophet. This obedience is not inherent in Prophethood but 
is only practical shape of obedience to Allah. A Messenger is to be obeyed 
because he is the authentic means through which we can receive Commandments and 
instructions from Allah. Hence, we can obey Allah only by obeying His Messenger, 
for no other way of obedience is genuine. As a corollary of this, the breach of 
allegiance to the Messenger shall be a rebellion against the Sovereign, Whom he 
represents. A Tradition explains the same thing thus: "Whoever obeys me, obeys 
Allah and whoever disobeys me, disobeys Allah." The same thing has also been 
explicitly stated in v. 80 of this Surah.<br><br>(3) After the first and the 
second allegiance, and subordinate to these, the Muslims owe allegiance to those 
invested with authority from among themselves. The Arabic word ulil-amr is very 
comprehensive, which comprises all those persons who are in any way at the helm 
of the affairs of the Muslims-religious scholars, thinkers, political leaders, 
administrators, judges of law courts, tribal chiefs and the like. In short, all 
those, who are in any way invested with authority from among the Muslims, are to 
be obeyed, and it is not right to disturb the peace of the community life of the 
Muslims by entering into conflict with them, provided that (a) they are from 
among the Muslims, and (b) they are obedient to Allah and His Messenger. These 
two conditions are a pre-requisite for obedience to them, and these have been 
explicitly laid down in the verse and have also been fully explained by the Holy 
Prophet. In support of this some Traditions are cited below:<br><br>(a) "It is 
obligatory on a Muslim to listen to and obey orders of those invested with 
authority, whether he likes it or dislikes it, provided that it is not sinful. 
However, if he is ordered to do a sinful thing, he should neither listen to the 
rulers nor obey their orders." (Bukhari, Muslim).<br><br>(b) "Obedience to 
anyone in a sinful thing is forbidden. Obedience is obligatory only in what is 
right." (Bukhari, Muslim).<br><br>(c) The Holy Prophet said, "There will be 
rulers over you who will practice right things as well as wrong things: (In such 
a case) whoever protests against the wrong things, shall be absolved from the 
responsibility and whoever dislikes the wrong things, also shall escape 
(punishment). But whoever approves of and follows them, shall incur punishment." 
The Companions asked, "Should we not then fight against such rulers?" The Holy 
Prophet answered, "No, as long as they offer the Salat." (Muslim)<br><br>That 
is, if they discard the Salat, it will be a clear proof of their disobedience to 
Allah and His Messenger. Then it will be right to rise against them<br><br>(d) 
The Holy Prophet said, "Your worst rulers are those whom you hate and who hate 
you, whom you curse and who curse you." The Companions asked, "O Messenger of 
God, should we not rise against such rulers?" The Holy Prophet answered, "No, as 
long as they establish the Salat among you." (Muslim)<br><br>In this Tradition, 
the condition about the Salat laid down in the preceding one, has been made more 
explicit. One might have inferred from (c) that if they offered the Salat in 
their individual capacities, no rising should be organized against them. But 
Tradition (d) explicitly lays down that the condition for obedience to those in 
authority is the establishment of the system of Salat by them in the Muslim 
Community. The rulers should not only themselves offer the Salat regularly, but 
they should also establish the Salat in the system of government run by them. 
This is the minimum condition that ' makes a government Islamic in principle. If 
a government lacks this, it will mean that such a government has discarded 
Islam, and the Muslims will be justified in overthrowing it. This same thing has 
also been stated in another Tradition thus: "The Holy Prophet took a covenant 
from us regarding certain things. One of these was that we would not engage in a 
dispute with those invested with authority unless we saw in them clear signs of 
disbelief, which may provide us with a cogent reason to present before Allah." 
(Bukhari, Muslim)<br><br>(4) The fourth thing that has been laid down as an 
absolute and permanent principle is that the Commandments of Allah and the 
Sunnah of His Messenger are the fundamentals of law and final authority in the 
Islamic system. Hence, if a dispute arises about any matter between the Muslims 
or between the rulers and the ruled, they should turn to the Qur'an and the 
Sunnah for a decision and they should all submit to the decision. Thus, the 
essential element in the Islamic system that distinguishes it from un-Islamic 
systems is to acknowledge the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger as 
the final authority and to turn to these and to submit to their decisions in all 
problems of life. Any system void of this is most surely an un lslamic system.<br>
<br>Some people doubt the soundness of this principle. They say that it fails in 
practical life for the simple reason that there are many aspects of life (e.g., 
Local Self department. Railway department, Postal department, etc. etc.,) for 
which there are no rules and regulations at all in the Book of Allah and the 
Sunnah of His Messenger. How then can they find the solution of the problems 
they meet with in such aspects of life as concern such departments? This doubt 
arises because they do not, understand the fundamental principles of Islam. 
Islam allows freedom of action in all those things about which the Book of Allah 
and the Sunnah of His Messenger are silent. What distinguishes a Muslim from a 
non-Muslim is that the latter claims absolute freedom but the former considers 
himself to be the servant of Allah and uses only that amount of freedom which 
Islam allows him. The non-Muslim judges all matters in accordance with the rules 
and regulations made by himself and does not believe that he stands in need of 
Divine Guidance. In contrast to him, the Muslim, first of all, turns to Allah 
and His Messenger for guidance about everything and abides by their decision. 
But if he does not find any commandment therein about a certain thing, only then 
he is free to act in a manner he considers to be right. The very fact that the 
Law is silent about a certain thing, is a proof that it allows freedom of action 
in that particular matter. <br><br>90In the first part of this verse, the Qur'an 
enunciates the tour fundamental principles of the Islamic Constitution, and in 
the second part teaches the wisdom that underlies them. The Muslims have been 
enjoined to follow the four fundamental principles if they are true believers; 
otherwise their profession of Islam will become doubtful. Then they have been 
taught to build their system of life on these because therein also lies their 
well-being; for this alone can keep them on the right path in this world and 
lead them to a happy life in the Hereafter.<br><br>It should also be noted that 
this piece of advice follows the critical review of the moral and religious 
condition of the Jews and warns the Muslims in a subtle manner to learn a lesson 
from their deplorable condition. It says that whenever a community flings the 
Book of Allah and the guidance of His Messenger behind its back and follows such 
leaders as are disobedient to Allah and His Messenger, and blindly obeys its 
rulers and religious leaders without demanding from thetas the authority of the 
Book and the Sunnah, it can never escape those evils in which the children of 
Israel were involved.<br><br>91In this verse, Taghut clearly stands for the 
authority that makes decisions in accordance with laws other than Divine and the 
system of judiciary which acknowledges neither Allah as the Supreme Sovereign 
nor His Book as the final authority. Hence, this verse is explained that it is 
contrary to Faith to take one's case for decision to a law court which by its 
nature is, that of taghut Belief in Allah and His Book makes it obligatory on 
the Believer that he should refuse to acknowledge such a court as lawful. 
According to the Qur'an, belief in Allah and disbelief in taghut are 
correlatives; therefore to acknowledge both at one and the same time is nothing 
but hypocrisy itself. <br><br>92This shows that the hypocrites used to bring 
only such cases before the Holy Prophet as were likely to be decided in their 
favor, but would refrain from bringing such cases, which they feared, would be 
decided against them. The same is true of many hypocrites of today: they are 
ever ready to submit to the decisions of the Islamic Law if and whenever it goes 
in their favor; otherwise they resort to any law, any custom, and any law court 
which, they expect, will ensure their interests. <br><br>93Probably it means 
that when their hypocritical deeds are exposed and they fear that action will be 
taken against them; they take oaths to assure the Believers of their innocence.
<br><br>94It clearly defines the position of the Messenger: the Messenger does 
not come from Allah so that the people should simply acknowledge him as a 
Messenger and then continue to obey anyone they like. The Messenger is sent with 
the sole object that the code of life brought by him only should be followed 
instead of all other codes, and the commandments brought by him from Allah only 
should be obeyed instead of all other commandments. If anyone does not 
acknowledge the Messenger in this sense, his acknowledging him merely as a 
Messenger would be meaningless. <br><br>95The commandment contained in verse 65 
was not meant to be confined to the lifetime of the Holy Prophet, but it was to 
hold good up to the Last Day. Whatever the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) 
brought from Allah and whatever way of life he followed and practiced under His 
guidance and inspiration, shall remain the final authority among Muslims for 
ever and the acknowledgment of that authority alone determines whether one is a 
true Muslim or not. According to a Tradition, the Holy Prophet said: "None of 
you can claim to be a believer unless he subordinates his desires and lusts to 
the way that I have brought." <br><br>96In verse 65, they have been admonished 
to submit gracefully and sincerely to the way of life brought by the Holy 
Prophet and to subordinate their desires and interests to his decision. In this 
verse they have been warned that if they cannot sacrifice even their small 
interests in following the Islamic Law, they can never be expected to make any 
bigger sacrifice. if they were asked to sacrifice their lives or leave their 
homes in the way of God, they would then discard totally the way of Faith and 
obedience and follow the ways of disbelief and disobedience instead. <br><br>
97That is, "If they had given up doubt, hesitation and indecision and obeyed and 
followed the Messenger without any mental reservation, their position would have 
become firm and stable and their thoughts, their morals and their affairs would 
have secured a strong and permanent foundation. In short, they would have 
enjoyed all those blessings that are obtained by following steadfastly a 
straight royal road. On the contrary, the one who wavers in indecision and 
irresolution, and sometimes takes one road and then another, without faith in 
either, his whole life passes without any achievement and becomes an object 
lesson of failure." <br><br>98That is, if they had resolved to obey the Holy 
Messenger sincerely without harboring any doubts in their minds, the right way 
of life would have become very clear to them by the grace of Allah, and they 
would have clearly seen as to how they should employ their energy and effort so 
as to get further and further close to their real goal in life.<br><br>99Siddiq 
is one who is upright and just: who is always actuated by truth and 
righteousness; who is fair and equitable in all his dealings; who always sides 
with truth and justice from the core of his heart; who opposes tooth and nail 
all that is unfair, without showing the least weakness; who is so pure and so 
unselfish that both friends and foes expect nothing but impartiality from him.<br>
<br>The literal meaning of shahid is "a witness" .It implies the one who bears 
witness to the 'truth of his Faith by following it in all aspects of his life. A 
martyr also is a shahid because he willingly suffers death by fighting in the 
cause of Allah. By sacrificing his life for the cause he believes to be true, he 
gives a practical demonstration of the sincerity of his Faith. Those righteous 
people who are so trustworthy that their mere evidence for anything to be true 
is a sufficient proof of its genuineness are also shahid.<br><br>Salih is one 
who is upright in his beliefs, intentions, words and actions and adopts the 
right attitude in every aspect of life. <br><br>100That is, "Undoubtedly the 
person who enjoys the company of such people in this world and rises with them 
in the Hereafter is really very fortunate." Unless one's feelings are totally 
deadened, one is bound to feel that the company of evil and immoral people is a 
painful torment even in this world and it would be . <br><br>101It should be 
noted that this address was revealed at the time when the neighboring tribes had 
been emboldened by the defeat of the Muslims at Uhd. They were surrounded by 
danger on all sides and were hearing persistent rumors about the active 
hostilities of, and imminent attacks from, different quarters. There were cases 
of treachery also. The Muslim missionaries were invited cunningly to the 
outskirts of Madinah. These circumstances urgently required that the Muslims 
should struggle hard to save the Islamic Movement from failure and destruction 
in the face of such overwhelming threats.<br><br>102The other meanings are that 
not only he himself shows lack of courage to face danger but also discourages 
and dissuades others from Jihad. <br><br>103That is, "Let them clearly 
understand that those people, who hanker after worldly benefits only, are not 
fit to fight in the way of Allah. On the contrary, only those people are worthy 
of fighting in the way of Allah who have no other desire or object than to 
please Him and who have perfect belief in Allah and the Hereafter and are, 
therefore, ready to sacrifice all interests and all chances of prosperity and 
enjoyment in this world for the sake of pleasing their Lord. They sincerely 
believe that their sacrifices will not go in vain in the Hereafter, even if they 
might not have been- "successful" in this life. Thus it is obvious that those 
who attach real importance only to their worldly interests cannot tread the path 
of Allah."<br><br>104This was the cry of the poor and helpless children, men and 
women who had accepted Islam at Makkah and at other places but had no means of 
migrating to Madinah, or defending themselves from persecution. They were being 
persecuted and oppressed in all sorts of manners and were invoking the help of 
Allah to deliver them from that horrible state. <br><br>105In the sight of 
Allah, there are two distinct parties of fighters. One party is that of the 
Believers who fight for the cause of Allah in order to establish his way on His 
earth, and every sincere Believer is bound to perform this duty. The other party 
is that of unbelievers who fight in the way of Taghut so as to establish the 
rule of the rebels against Allah on His earth and no Believer would side with 
them in this evil work. <br><br>106The Believers have been assured that they 
should not be cowed and terrified by the apparent grand preparations and evil 
designs of Satan and his companions: because ultimately they are bound to fail.<br>
<br>107This verse has three meanings, and all three are equally correct.<br><br>
First, it means that those very people who were then showing cowardice were very 
impatient to fight before permission was given for this. They would repeat the 
tales of their persecution and oppression and say, "Give us permission to fight, 
for we have no more patience left to bear these wrongs. " At that time when they 
were advised to be patient for the time being and to purify themselves by means 
of Salat and Zakat, they would resent such pieces of advice. But when the 
Command to fight was given, some of those very people began to show cowardice 
when they confronted the enemy armies and the dangers of war.<br><br>The second 
meaning is that those people were very 'religious' as long as such harmless 
demands as the offering of Salat and the payment of Zakat were made; but no 
sooner was the demand to fight in the way of Allah made on them than they were 
filled with terror and fear for their lives, and they forgot all about their 
religiosity.<br><br>The third meaning is that during the pre-Islamic period, 
they were ready to fight for the sake of the spoils or for the gratification of 
their whims, and were engaged day and night in war. That is why, after embracing 
Islam, they were enjoined to desist a while from fighting and to reform their 
souls by means of the Salat and Zakat. But when they were enjoined to fight in 
the way of Allah, the same people who showed reckless bravery in fighting for 
the sake of false pride, were showing timidity, and those who were dare-devils 
turned into milksops and shirked fight.<br><br>The above mentioned three 
meanings apply to the three different categories of people and the words of the 
Arabic text are so comprehensive that they fit equally into all the three cases.<br>
<br>108That is, "You need not worry about your reward from Allah for the service 
you render to His cause. If you exert your utmost in His way, Allah will not let 
your work go waste. " <br><br>109They have been admonished for their attitude 
towards the Holy Prophet. When there was success and victory, they would 
attribute it to Allah's grace and forgot that Allah had blessed them with grace 
through him. But when they suffered a defeat or had a set-back because of their 
own errors and weaknesses, they would lay the whole blame on the Holy Prophet, 
and would absolve themselves from all responsibility.<br><br>110That is, "They 
themselves are responsible for their deeds and you will not be answerable for 
them. What you have been entrusted with, is to convey to them the commandments 
and instructions from God. And you have done that admirably well. Now it is not 
your obligation to force them to adopt the right way, and if they do not follow 
the Guidance they are receiving through you, you shall not be held responsible 
for their disobedience." <br><br>111The main cause of the wrong attitude of the 
hypocrites and the people of weak faith, who had been warned in the foregoing 
verses, was that they had doubts that the Qur'an was from Allah. They could not 
believe that it was being sent down by Allah to the Holy Prophet and that the 
Commandments contained in it were directly coming from Him. That is why they are 
being admonished to consider the Qur'an by giving close attention to it, and to 
verify whether their doubts are genuine and whether it is from Allah or not. The 
Qur'an itself bears witness to the truth that it is from none other than Allah, 
for none else, however wise and intelligent he might be, could have gone on 
delivering addresses under different circumstances about variant topics so as to 
form a connected, balanced and coherent Book at the end of twenty-three years 
and that too, without showing any contradiction whatever from the beginning to 
the end, and without there arising any need to revise or make any change in it.<br>
<br>112During the period of excitement, rumors were on the air from many 
quarters. Sometimes baseless and exaggerated reports were received that caused 
alarm in Madinah and its outskirts. Then some cunning enemy would send news that 
all was quiet in the enemy camp, merely to conceal some impending danger and to 
keep the Muslims off their guard. Only those people who loved excitement, took 
keen interest in such rumors; who did not take the conflict between Islam and 
un-Islam to be a serious matter; and who did not realize the grave consequences 
of indulging in such baseless rumors. Whenever they heard any rumor, they would 
spread it from place to place, without considering the great harm their pastime 
was causing.<br><br>In this verse, such people have been warned of the gravity 
of their offense and strictly admonished to refrain from spreading rumors. They 
have been told to report any news they heard to the responsible people and then 
keep silent about it. <br><br>113Different people behave differently and with 
different results. Some urge on others to exert themselves for the cause of 
Allah and to exalt His Word and they get its reward. There are others who spread 
misunderstandings among the people about Allah's cause, discourage the Muslims 
and try to dissuade them from exalting the Word of Allah and thus incur 
punishment.<br><br>114The Muslims were specially exhorted to be very civil and 
polite to the non-Muslims because at that time their relations were strained on 
account of the conflict between them. In that state of tension, they were 
forewarned to be on their guard against incivility and impoliteness. They were, 
therefore, taught to be equally civil and polite to them when they greeted them 
respectfully. Nay, they should be even more civil and polite than their 
opponents.<br><br>Harsh behavior and harsh words do no good to anyone but they 
are specially unsuited to the work of those missionaries of Allah's Message, who 
have dedicated themselves to one day invite the world to the Truth and exerted 
themselves to reform the ways of the people. Such ill behavior may satisfy one's 
vanity, but it does great harm to one's mission.<br><br>115That is, "The 
misbehaviour of the unbelievers, atheists, polytheists and the like can do no 
damage to the Godhead of Allah, for they cannot alter the fact that He is the 
One and All-Powerful Sovereign, and that, one day He will assemble together all 
human beings and deal with them in accordance with their deeds and none will be 
able to escape from His retribution. Therefore, Allah does not stand in need of 
anyone to defend Him against His rebels by showing incivility and impoliteness 
to them.<br><br>That is the bearing of this verse on the preceding verse. But 
this verse also serves as an appendix to the passage that began from verse 60. 
In that case it means: Let any body follow any way he chooses and work in any 
way he likes in this world but he should not forget that one Day everyone shall 
have to go in the presence of Allah Who is the sole Sovereign. Then everyone 
shall see the result of his actions and deeds. <br><br>116This passage deals 
with the problem of those hypocritical Muslims who had accepted Islam in Makkah 
and other parts of Arabia but had not emigrated, to Madinah. They lived as 
before with their people, and took more or less a practical part in all their 
hostile activities against Islam and the Muslims. They had become a very 
difficult problem for the Muslims who did not know how to deal with them. Some 
Muslims were of the opinion that they were after all "Muslim" because they 
recited the kalimah (the article of the Muslims' Faith), offered the Salat, 
observed the Fast and recited the Qur'an. Then how could they be dealt with like 
the disbelievers? Allah in this passage has removed that difference of opinion 
from among the Muslims and told them how to deal with them.<br><br>At this place 
one should clearly understand why those Muslims who did not emigrate to Madinah 
were declared to be hypocrites; otherwise one might not be able to interpret 
correctly this passage and the like passages of the Qur'an. The fact of the 
matter is that when the Holy Prophet migrated to Madinah and conditions were 
created there for the fulfillment of the requirements of Islam, a general order 
was given that all those Muslims who were oppressed in any place and in any 
tribe or clan and could not freely carry out their Islamic obligations, should 
migrate to Madinah, "the Abode of Islam." As a result, all those who could 
emigrate but did not do so because they loved their homes, their relatives and 
their interests more than Islam, were declared to be hypocrites. Only such of 
those as were really being prevented by impediments were declared to be helpless 
in verse 97 of this Surah.<br><br>It is obvious that the Muslims living in the 
"abode of unbelief" may be declared hypocrites for not migrating only if a 
general invitation is extended to them by the people living in "the Abode of 
Islam", or at least the doors of" the Abode of Islam" are kept open for them. In 
such a case all those Muslims who may be doing nothing to change "the abode of 
unbelief" into "the Abode of Islam", nor emigrate to "the Abode of Islam", even 
if they could, would be declared hypocrites. <br><br>117Allah turned the 
hypocrites back to their former unbelief because they followed a double-faced 
policy and were time-servers. As they preferred the life of this world to that 
of the Hereafter, they had entered the fold of Islam with some mental 
reservations. They were not prepared to sacrifice those interests which came 
into conflict with the requirements of the Faith and they did not have that firm 
belief in the Hereafter which makes one sacrifice with perfect peace of mind 
this world for the sake of the Next World: It has thus become obvious that the 
line of demarcation was so clearcut that there ought not to have been two 
opinions about hypocrisy. <br><br>118Here the Muslims have been asked to catch 
hold of those hypocrites who belonged to the belligerent disbelievers and were 
actually engaged in hostile activities against the Islamic State. <br><br>119The 
exception is only concerning the first part of the Command. Though the blood of 
such a hypocrite is lawful, he is not to be pursued and killed, if he has sought 
asylum in the territory of a non-Muslim State, which is an ally to the Islamic 
State. This is not because of the sanctity of the blood of the hypocrite but 
because of the sanctity of the treaty.<br><br>120This does not refer to the 
category of the above-mentioned hypocrites whose blood has been made lawful, but 
to the sincere Muslims who lived either in "the Abode of Islam", or in "the war 
zone" or "the abode of unbelief", against whom there was no proof that they had 
taken part in the hostile activities of the enemies of Islam: such a warning was 
necessary because there were many people who had accepted Islam sincerely but 
were still forced by circumstances to live among the foes of Islam; and there 
had been cases when some of them were accidentally killed by their Muslim 
brethren during an attack on an enemy clan. Therefore, Allah has enjoined what a 
Muslim, who kills a Muslim by mis-chance, must do to expiate such an accidental 
sin. <br><br>121As the slain person was a Believer, a believing slave is to be 
set free as expiation for his accidental murder. <br><br>122The Holy Prophet 
prescribed one hundred camels or two hundred cows or two thousand goats as 
blood-money to be paid to the survivors of the slain man. If one desired to pay 
it in any other form, he would have to calculate it in terms of the market price 
of these animals. For instance, the blood-money paid in cash during the time of 
the Holy Prophet was eight hundred gold dinars or eight thousand silver dirhams. 
During his Caliphate, Hadrat 'Umar declared, "Now that the price of a camel has 
gone up, one thousand dinars or twelve thousand dirhams should be paid as 
blood-money. " It should, however,, be noted that the blood money prescribed 
here is not for a willful murder but for an accidental one. <br><br>123In brief, 
the following are the Commandments contained in v. 92:<br><br>If the slain 
person is an inhabitant of "the Abode of Islam," his murderer shall have to pay 
blood-money as compensation and also to set free a slave to earn his forgiveness 
from God.<br><br>And if he is an inhabitant of a "war zone", the murderer shall 
have only to set free a slave and not to pay any blood-money.<br><br>And if he 
belongs to an "abode of unbelief" which is an ally of the Islamic State, the 
murderer shall have to set free a slave and also have to pay blood-money equal 
to the amount of the blood-money of a non-Muslim victim as contained in the 
treaty. <br><br>124These fasts must be consecutive without a single day's break; 
if there is a single break, except if it be in accordance with the Law, one 
shall have to begin the prescribed fasting anew for two full months. <br><br>
125That is, "The freeing of a slave or the payment of blood-money or the fasting 
for two consecutive months is not a penalty but is repentance and kaffarah 
(cover) for the offense. The difference between the two is that in the case of 
penalty, there is no feeling of self-reproach, compunction, contrition and 
self-reform, but there is a feeling of disgust and aversion, and it leaves 
disgust and bitterness behind it. That is why Allah enjoins kaffarah and 
repentance so that the offender may be able to purify his soul by means of good 
deeds, devotion and fulfillment of the rights, and turn to Allah through 
self-reproach and compunction. in this way the sinner will not only atone for 
his present sin but will also refrain in future from such errors.<br><br>
Kaffarah literally means a cover; a good deed that is performed as kaffarah for 
a sin, so to say, covers it just as a white-wash covers a blot on a wall. <br>
<br>126In the early days of Islam, Assalam-u-alaikum (peace be upon you) was a 
symbol of recognition for Muslims. When a Muslim met another Muslim, he greeted 
him with this salutation, as if to say, "I belong to your own community; I am 
your friend and well-wisher. I have nothing but peace and security for you; so 
you should not show enmity towards me nor fear enmity and harm from me." It was 
like a "pass-word" used in the army while passing through a line of guards at 
night so as to discern between friends and foes.<br><br>The importance of the 
salutation of peace as a symbol of recognition was specially great at that time 
because there was no apparent mark of distinction between a Muslim Arab and a 
non-Muslim Arab, as they wore the same kind of dress and spoke the semi 
language. Still a difficulty arose when the Muslims attacked some clan and a 
local Muslim also became the target of attack. Then he would cry out, Asalam-u-alaikum 
or La llaha illallah (there is no god but Allah). But the attacking Muslims 
would suspect him to be a disbeliever who was using the password as a trick 
merely to save his life. They would, therefore, often kill him and take 
possession of his belongings as spoils. Although the Holy Prophet would severely 
admonish the offenders on such occasions, yet there was a recurrence of such 
incidents. Then Allah solved the difficulty in this verse, which means, "You 
have no right to judge cursorily that the man, who is declaring himself to be a 
Muslim, is telling a lie merely to save his life. It is equally possible that he 
may be speaking the truth, or telling a lie, and one cannot know the reality 
without making a thorough investigation. Thus, while there is a chance of 
letting off a disbeliever by accepting his salutations of peace as genuine, 
there is also the more horrible chance of killing an innocent Believer. In any 
case, it is far better to let off a disbeliever by mistake than to kill a 
Reliever by error.<br><br>127That is, There was a time when you yourselves were 
scattered as individuals among different clans of disbelievers. You were then 
hiding your Islam for fear of oppression and persecution and you could offer no 
other proof of your Faith except by an oral expression. Now it is the bounty of 
Allah that you are enjoying community life and are able to raise the banner of 
Islam against the disbelievers. The right way of showing gratitude to Allah for 
this bounty is to show kindness and leniency to those Muslims who are still in 
the same state in which you were before this.<br><br>128In this passage, the 
relative status of true Muslims has been assigned according as they behave when 
they are asked to go to Jihad on a voluntary basis, when the leader of the 
Islamic forces does not require the whole Muslim force. Those who offer 
themselves and their wealth and go to Jihad have been assigned a higher rank 
than those who stay at home, even though the latter might have been engaged in 
other good works; moreover, there is, for the former a `promise of a good 
reward.' As regards those who stay at home, when they are ordered to go to 
Jihad, by making excuses or even those who shirk Jihad, when a general order is 
given for Jihad and Jihad becomes an obligatory duty in these two cases those 
who are engaged in other works and do not go to Jihad are hypocrites and are not 
entitled to the benefit of the 'promise of a good reward' except that they stay 
behind for any genuine excuse.<br><br>129"Those who were doing wrong to their 
own souls" were the people who had accepted Islam but were still living among 
their own clans, which had not yet embraced Islam, without any genuine excuse or 
compulsion. They were doing wrong to their own selves by living in a state of 
semi-Islam, although "the Abode of Islam" had come into existence where they 
could migrate and live the full life of a Muslim. They were quite content to 
live such a wretched life of semi-unbelief, according to their faith because 
they preferred their comforts, their families, their properties and their 
interests to their Faith. That is why their excuse, "We were weak and helpless 
in the land", has not been accepted. (Please also see E.N.116). <br><br>130That 
is, "Why did you continue to live in a place which was oppressed by the rebels 
against Allah and where it was not possible to live in accordance with the Law 
of Allah? And why did you not migrate to a place where you could follow the 
Divine Law without any hindrance?" <br><br>131As regards "migration in the way 
of Allah", it is an obligation with two exceptions: one may remain there to 
struggle for the establishment of Islam and to change the system of life based 
on unbelief into the system of Islam; just as the Prophets and their immediate 
followers did in the initial stages of their mission; or one may remain there in 
a state of great disgust and repugnance as long as one is unable to find any way 
out of it. With the exception of the above two cases, it will be a life of 
continuous sin to live in an "abode of unbelief". The excuse that "We could not 
find any `Abode of Islam' for migration" shall not be accepted and will be met 
with the rebuff: "If there was no `Abode of Islam', was there no forest or 
mountain where you could live on the leaves of trees and the milk of goats in 
order to escape from submission to the laws of unbelief?"<br><br>In this 
connection, a misunderstanding about the Tradition, "No migration after the 
conquest of Makkah", may also be removed. This was not a permanent command 
concerning migration but only a temporary instruction that suited the changed 
conditions of Arabia after the conquest of Makkah. As long as the major portion 
of Arabia was the "abode of unbelief", the Muslims were enjoined to migrate to 
Madinah, which was the only "Abode of Islam" at the time. But when almost all 
the parts of Arabia came under Islam, the Holy Prophet so to say, merely 
canceled the first command under which migration was compulsory, saying, "There 
is no more (compulsory) migration (to Madinah) after the conquest of Makkah." 
The Tradition was never meant to be a prohibitory command for all the Muslims of 
the world for all times to come up to the Last Day. <br><br>132The shortening of 
the obligatory part of the Salat during a journey in peace time is, `to reduce 
four rak'ats to two rak`ats"but there is no prescribed limit to the reduction 
during actual fighting. The Salat must be offered any-how in any form as the 
circumstances on the occasion permit. If it is possible to offer the Salat in 
congregation, it should be offered in congregation; otherwise the soldiers 
should say it individually. If it is not possible to turn the face to the qiblah, 
it may be offered facing any other direction. If it is not possible to remain 
stationary for the Salat, it may be offered while riding or walking. If it is 
not possible to bend down or prostrate, one should do so symbolically. If, 
during the Salat, it becomes necessary to move from that place, one may continue 
the Prayer even during the movement. There is no harm in offering the Salat, 
even if one's clothes become stained with blood. And even if in spite of all 
these concessions, it is not possible to offer it at all, it may then be 
reluctantly postponed, as was done during the course of the "Battle of the 
Trench."<br><br>There is a difference of opinion as to whether the obligatory 
parts (fara `id) only are to be offered in a journey or those parts (sunnats) 
also that were practised by the Holy Prophet in addition to the former. When on 
a journey the Holy Prophet used to offer without fail two rak`ats in addition to 
the obligatory rak`ats of Salat-ul-Fajr (Morning Prayers) and three rak`ats of 
witr with Salat-ul- 'Isha' (Night Prayer). At other times he only offered the 
obligatory parts; there is no proof of his offering the sonnet parts. He, 
however, used to offer "additional prayers" (nawafil), whenever he got time for 
these even while he was riding. That is why Hadrat 'Abdullah bin `Umar 
prohibited the people from offering the sunnats during a journey except with the 
Morning Prayer. But the majority of the scholars leave it to the individual's 
option to offer or not to offer the sunnats on a journey. The Hanafis are of the 
opinion that it is better to leave them during the actual journey but one must 
offer them at a halting place, if one can get the necessary peace of mind.<br>
<br>As regards the nature of the journey in which the Salat may be 
shortened,some scholars (Ibn 'Umar, Ibn Mas'ud and 'Ata) have imposed the 
condition that it should he in the way of Allah, e.g., for Jihad, Hajj, `Umrah, 
or in quest of knowledge, etc. Imam Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad are of the opinion 
that the journey should be for some lawful purpose; otherwise one has no right 
of enjoying the concession of reduction in Salat. The Hanafi s are of the 
opinion that the Salat may be shortened during any kind of journey, irrespective 
of the purpose for which it is undertaken. As regards the nature of the journey, 
it may merit reward or punishment by itself, but it does not affect the 
concession of reduction in Salat.<br><br>Some of the Imams have interpreted 
words "there is no harm" to mean that "reduction in the Prayer" is not 
obligatory but merely optional. One may make use of the permission and shorten 
his Salat or may not. Imam Shafi'i holds the same view, though he considers it 
better to shorten it. He is of the opinion that one who does not make use of the 
"reduction", gives up the higher thing and adopts a lower thing. Imam Ahmad is 
of the opinion that although "reduction" is not obligatory, yet it is improper 
not to make use of the concession. Imam Abu Hanifah considers "reduction" 
obligatory and there is also a tradition from Imam Malik to the same effect. All 
the traditions from the Holy Prophet show that in his Journeys he always 
shortened his Salat and there is no authentic Tradition to show that he ever 
offered four rak`ats on a journey. Ibn `Umar says, "During the journeys I 
accompanied the Holy Prophet, Abu Bakr, `Umar or ` Uthman (may Allah be pleased 
with them all), and I witnessed that they always shortened their Salat and never 
offered four rak`ats. " The same view is also supported by authentic traditions 
from Ibn `Abbas and several other Companions.<br><br>Once during Hajj, Hadrat `Uthman 
performed four rak ats while he was leading the Salat at Mina and the Companions 
objected to it. He satisfied them, saying, "I have taken a wife from Makkah and 
I have heard from the Holy Prophet that whoever marries at a place becomes a 
citizen of that place. Therefore I have . not shortened my prayer."<br><br>There 
are, however, two traditions against this from Hadrat `A'ishah which show that 
it is equally right to make a "reduction" in the Salat or to say it in full. But 
these traditions are weak in authenticity and contrary to her own practice, for 
she herself practiced "reduction".<br><br>In this connection, it may also be 
noted that sometimes one feels oneself to be "on a journey" as well as "at home" 
when one may shorten the Salat or offer it in full at one and the same halting 
place according to the circumstances. Most probably Hadrat `A'ishah referred to 
such a state, saying: "When on a journey, the Holy Prophet sometimes shortened 
his Salat and sometimes offered it in full. "<br><br>As regards the words, 
"There is no harm if you shorten your Prayer", it is not correct to conclude 
that the "Command" is optional. The same words have been used in connection with 
running between Safa and Marwa on the occasion of Hajj, in verse 158 of Al-Baqarah, 
although this is an essential part of Hajj. As a matter of fact, these words 
have been used in both the places to allay the fear that shortening of the 
Prayer or running between Safa and Marwa might entail a sin or lessen one's 
rewards.<br><br>As regards the length of the journey, the Zahirites are of the 
opinion that "reduction" may be made in any journey irrespective of the 
distance. According to Imam Malik, the minimum distance of the journey should be 
48 miles, or its duration should be at least one day and one night. Hadrat Ibn 
`Abbas and Imam Ahmad are also of the same opinion and a saying of Imam Shafi`i 
also supports the same. But the minimum distance for "reduction" according to 
Hadrat Anas is 15 miles, while Imam Auza`i and Imam Zuhri follow the opinion of 
Hadrat `Umar that one day's journey suffices for "reduction" . According to 
Hadrat Hasan Basri and Imam Abu Yusuf, the minimum journey of two days entitles 
one to shorten one's Salat. Imam Abu Hanifah is of the opinion that "reduction" 
may be made in a journey of a minimum distance of 54 miles. The same is the 
opinion of Ibn `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud and Hadrat `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with 
them all).<br><br>Opinions differ regarding the "reduction" in a halt during the 
course of a journey. Imam Ahmad is of the opinion that if one intends to halt at 
a place for four days, one will have to offer the Prayer in full. According to 
Imam Malik and lmam Shafe`i, "reduction" is not lawful at a place where one 
intends to halt for more than four days. Imam Auza`i extends it to 13 days and 
Imam Abu Hanifah to 15 days or more and enjoins offering of the full Prayer 
during such a halt. But there is no explicit command of the Holy Prophet about 
this. However, there is a consensus of opinion that if one is forced by 
circumstances to halt at a place but intends to leave it for home at any time, 
one may go on practising "reduction" for an indefinite period of time. There are 
instances when some Companions practiced "reduction" continuously even for two 
years for the same reason. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal allows a prisoner to make 
"reduction" during the whole term of his imprisonment. <br><br>133The Zahirites 
and the Kharijites interpret this sentence to mean that reduction in the Salat 
may be made only during state of war and that reduction in a journey during 
peace time is against the Qur'an. But we learn from an authentic "Tradition that 
once when Hadrat `Umar presented the same objection before the Holy Prophet, he 
answered, "The concession of 'reduction' is a bounty from Allah; therefore, 
enjoy it". This is a well known fact that the Holy Prophet availed of the 
concession in every journey both during war time and during peace time.<br><br>
Another tradition from Ibn `Abbas makes the position clear, saying, "The Holy 
Prophet went to Makkah from Madinah and there was no fear of anyone except of 
God but he reduced tour rak' ats of the Salat to two rak'ats ". That is the 
reason why the word "especially" has been added in brackets in the translation. 
"<br><br>134From the words. "And when you, O Prophet, are among the Muslims", 
Imam Abu Yusuf and Hasan bin Ziyad have concluded that the commandment about the 
"Salat of Fear" was meant to be in force only during the lifetime of the Holy 
Prophet. But there are many instances in the Qur'an that a commandment has been 
addressed to the Holy Prophet and the same also holds good for his successors 
after him. Therefore, there is no reason why the commandment about the "Salat of 
Fear" be restricted to the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. Then there are 
instances that many of the great Companions offered the "Salat of Fear" after 
his death and no difference of opinion in this regard has been reported from any 
Companion. <br><br>135This Commandment about the "Salat of Fear" applies to that 
state when there is a threat of imminent attack from the enemy but no actual 
fighting is going on. As regards the state of actual fighting, according to the 
Hanfis the Salat will be postponed to a later time, and according to Imam Malik 
and Imam Thauri, if it is not possible to bow and to prostrate, it should be 
performed by symbolic gestures. According to Imam Shaf`i, one may even during 
the "Salat of Fear". remain engaged a little in the conflict, if need be.<br>
<br>We learn from authentic Traditions that the Holy Prophet postponed four 
consecutive Salats during the Battle of the Trench, and afterwards when he got 
respite, he performed these in the respective order although the Commandment 
about the "Salat of Fear" had been sent down before this. <br><br>136The form of 
the "Salat of Fear" mainly depends upon the conditions of war. As the Holy 
Prophet led it in various ways, according to the different conditions, the 
Muslim leader of the time has the option of adopting any of those ways, 
according as it suits a certain occasion.<br><br>One way is that one section of 
the army should offer the Salat with the leader and the other should remain 
engaged in fighting against the enemy. After the performance of one rak stand 
after bringing the prayer to an end formally that section should fall back to 
the fighting line and the second section should perform the second rak at with 
the Imam. Thus, the leader will perform two rak 'ats while the sections will 
perform one rak`at each.<br><br>The second way is that one section should 
perform one rak `at with the Imam and fall back, then the second section should 
offer one rak at with the Imam and tall back; then each section should come 
back, turn by turn, and complete the second (i. e. the missed) rak at 
individually. In this way each section will perform the first rak`at behind the 
Imam and the second individually.<br><br>The third way is that one section of 
the army should perform two rak`ats with the Imam and after salutation should 
fall back to the fighting line. Then the second section should join in the third 
rak at and complete the Prayer with the Imam. Thus, the Imam will perform four 
rak`ats and each section of the army two rak ats each. v The fourth way is that 
one section should perform one rak `at behind the lmam and when the Imam stands 
up for the second rak at the followers should complete the second rak`at by 
themselves and then join the ranks. As regards the Imam, he should prolong his 
second rak`at so that the other section tray join him and perform their first 
rak`at behind him and complete their second rak`at by themselves.<br><br>The 
first way has been related by Ibn `Abbas, Jabir bin `Abdullah and Mujahid, and 
the second by `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and the Hanafis give preference to this. The 
third way has been related by Hasan Basri from Abu Bakrah and the fourth by Sahl 
bin Abi Hathmah and accepted by Imam Shafi`i and lmam Malik with a little 
modification.<br><br>There are other ways of offering the "salat of Fear" 
details of which may be had froth any of the numerous books of the Islamic Law 
and Regulations. <br><br>137The Muslims have been reassured that Allah Himself 
will deal severely with the disbelievers who are opposing the Truth with their 
false machinations and will bring ignominy to them. The precautionary measures 
that are being enjoined are merely from the practical point of view to teach 
them that they should, in their turn, exert their utmost and leave the result to 
Allah, in Whose hands really lies victory or defeat.<br><br>138"These people": 
the disbelievers who were opposing the Islamic mission and doing their utmost to 
prevent the establishment of the Islamic system of life. <br><br>139That is, "It 
is really strange that the believers should not bear bravely as many hardships 
for the sake of Truth as the disbelievers were bearing for falsehood, though the 
latter have no other object than this world and its transitory benefits. Whereas 
the believers have the highest object of pleasing the Lord of the heavens and 
the earth and expect to get everlasting rewards from Him." <br><br>140In vv. 
105-115, very important issues concerning an event that occurred at that time 
have been discussed.<br><br>There was in the Bani Zafar clan of the Ansar, a man 
known as Ta'mah or Bashir bin-Ubairiq. He stole the armor of another Ansari and 
hid it in the house of a Jew. When an investigation started into the theft, the 
owner of the armor placed the matter before the Holy Prophet and told him that 
he suspected Ta'mah of the theft. But the accused and his relatives and many 
other people of the Bani Zafar clan conspired and laid the guilt at the door of 
the Jew, who asserted that he was innocent of the thing. But Ta'mah's people 
went on pleading his case vehemently. They argued: "The statement of the Jew who 
is an enemy of the Truth and who disbelieves in Allah and His Messenger cannot 
be trusted; whereas we are Muslims, and, therefore, should be trusted." The Holy 
Prophet was naturally influenced by the seeming correctness of the argument and 
was about to acquit Ta'mah and give a warning to the plaintiff for bringing a 
false charge against a Muslim, and decide the case against the Jew, when this 
Revelation came and disclosed the reality of the matter.<br><br>It is true that 
even if the Holy Prophet had, as a judge, decided the case in the light of the 
evidence produced before him, he would not have incurred any blame, for judges 
have to give their decision according to the evidence that is presented before 
them and sometimes people do succeed in getting wrong judgments in their favor 
by misrepresentation. But the matter had another side: if the Holy Prophet had 
decided the case against the Jew at that time, when a bitter convict was raging 
between Islam and kufr, the enemies of Islam would have got a strong moral 
weapon against him, nay, against the Islamic Community and the Islamic Mission. 
They would have carried on a bitter propaganda against Islam, saying, "There is 
no justice among the Muslims; they practice prejudices and partisanship inspire 
of the fact that they preach against them as has been shown by this decision 
against the Jew". That is why, Allah directly intervened in the case to save 
them from this danger.<br><br>In this passage (vv. 105 - 115) on the one hand, 
those Muslims who tried to shield the guilty one of their own clan, have been 
strongly rebuked for their partisanship, and, on the other, the Muslims in 
general have been taught that they should not allow partisanship to stand in the 
way of justice. It is sheer dishonesty that one should plead the cause of one's 
own party man, even though he may he in the wrong, and oppose the man of the 
opposite party, even though he may he right.<br><br>141He who is dishonest to 
others is in reality dishonest to himself because he forces all his faculties of 
head and heart, which have been given to him as a trust, to help him in his 
dishonesty. Moreover, he suppresses his conscience, which Allah has given him to 
safeguard his morality, so as to disable it from functioning rightly and 
preventing him from being dishonest. Thus a man is dishonest to others only when 
at first he becomes unjust to himself.<br><br>142That is,'Even if they had 
succeeded in deceiving you by making a false report in regard to the case, and 
in getting your decision in their own favor, they would not have done any harm 
to you but to themselves, for even in that case they themselves would have been 
guilty in the sight of Allah, and not you". This is obvious because the real 
offender is the one who deceives the judge and gets a wrong judgment in his own 
favor, and not the judge who has to decide the case on the basis of the evidence 
presented before him. Moreover, such a one might delude himself that he has got 
"the right" on his side by his cunning devices, but in reality the "real right" 
remains the `right' in the record of Allah. (See also E.N. 192, Al-Baqarah).<br>
<br>143That is, "The dishonest 'Muslim' turned on the way of anti-Islam: so 
Allah also turned him on that way". It happened like this: when the facts of the 
case of theft were revealed by Allah and the innocent Jew was acquitted and 
Ta'amah was found guilty, this hypocrite left Madinah in anger and joined the 
enemies of the Holy Prophet at Makkah and began to oppose him openly.<br><br>
144In continuation of the foregoing theme, it has been stated that the 
hypocrite, who had in his anger gone to the side of the mushriks, did not fully 
realize the consequences of his foolish action. For this purpose, evils of the 
way he adopted and the nature of the fellows he accompanied have been pointed 
out. <br><br>145Though none worships Satan by performing devotional ceremonies 
before him, the one who surrenders oneself entirely to him and follows him 
wherever he misleads, does act like a devotee of Satan. This also makes it plain 
that one who obeys any other blindly, in fact, worships him. <br><br>146That is, 
"I will mark off for myself a portion of their time, their labor and their 
efforts, their energies and their abilities, their wealth and their offspring, 
and will entice them by deception so that they will devote the major portion of 
these in my way." <br><br>147This alludes to one of the superstitious customs of 
the pagan Arabs. After a she-camel had given birth to five or ten young ones, 
they would slit her ears and dedicate her to their god and consider it unlawful 
to get any work from her. Likewise, if a camel had been a partner in the birth 
of ten young ones, his ears were also slit to mark that he had been dedicated to 
a god. <br><br>148This does not condemn the alterations that man makes in the 
creation of God for their right and proper use, for in that case the whole of 
human civilization will stand condemned as a seduction of Satan. It is obvious 
that the civilization is nothing but the right and proper use of the things 
created by God. What the Qur'an describes as devilish alterations is to make 
wrong and improper use of things against human nature and against their natural 
functions. Hence, all those forms that are adopted as an escape from the designs 
of Nature are the results of the enticement of Satan e.g. sodomy, birth control, 
asceticism, etc. It is equally devilish that females should be made to give up 
their proper functions and to perform those duties which nature has assigned to 
males. Instances can be multiplied to show that the disciples of Satan consider 
the laws of the Creator of the Universe wrong and, therefore, are trying to 
"reform" them. <br><br>149The success of Satan depends entirely upon false 
promises and deceit In order to mislead individuals and communities, he presents 
very rosy pictures of his wrong ways to re-assure his victims. He tempts one by 
holding out the promise of pleasure and success. He allures some by giving the 
surety of national power and prosperity, while he deludes others by the prospect 
of the welfare of humanity. and deceives still others by telling them that his 
is the right way of arriving at the Truth. He also entices some by assuring them 
that there is no God and Hereafter and that life ends with death and others by 
giving them a guarantee that they would escape the consequences in the 
Hereafter, if there is Hereafter by the intercession of this or that saint.<br>
<br>150Since everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, the best 
thing for man is to surrender his independence completely to Him, and to submit 
to Him unreservedly. He will come nearer to Nature, if he willingly becomes His 
servant and obeys Him without showing any kind of rebellion against him. <br>
<br>151That is, if man does not submit and surrender to Allah, he cannot escape 
His punishment, for Allah encircles him on all sides.<br><br>152It has not been 
stated here what the people were asking concerning women, but the answer given 
to it in verse 128 points out the nature of the question. <br><br>153This is not 
the answer to the question but a sort of reminder of the commandments that have 
already been enjoined in vv. i-14 of this Surah about orphan girls in particular 
and the orphans in general in order to stress the importance of this matter in 
any scheme of social reform. It is because of its importance in the solution of 
social problems that before giving a verdict concerning marriage problems which 
were raised, Allah has again laid emphasis on the rights of orphans. <br><br>
154The allusion is to v.3 of this Surah: "If you are afraid of doing injustice 
to the orphans...." <br><br>155The words of the Text may also mean, "......whom 
you desire to marry." We learn from a Tradition of Hadrat 'A'ishah that the Text 
implies both the meanings. She says, "Those people who had the charge of the 
orphan girls who inherited wealth, employed different methods of doing injustice 
to them. If an orphan girl was wealthy and also beautiful, they would desire to 
marry her so that they might exploit her wealth and enjoy her beauty without 
incurring any financial liability. If she was wealthy but ugly, they would 
neither themselves marry her no let anyone else marry her, so that she might not 
get a protector who might claim tor her right from the guardian." <br><br>156The 
allusion is to the Commandments concerning the rights of orphans, given in vv. 
1-14 of the Surah.<br><br>157This verdict mentioned in v.127 as been given in 
this paragraph tw.l28-134). In order to understand it, one should grasp the 
nature of the problems to which this is the answer.<br><br>one liked without 
conceding any rights to them. But these verses limited the maximum number of 
wives to four and conceded the rights of dower to them and laid down the 
conditions of justice and equitable treatment for marrying more than one wife. 
As it appeared impossible to fulfill these conditions in certain cases, e.g.. if 
one's wife was barren or invalid or had lost attraction for him or was not fit 
for conjugal relationship, some problems arose when one married the second wife: 
was it a compulsory condition that one should show equal inclination towards 
both the wives or love them equally or show equality in the conjugal relations 
with them? Or, if this was not possible, did justice require that one should 
divorce the first wife before marrying the second? Or, if the first wife did not 
wish to part with her husband, would it be against the requirement of justice if 
she gave up some of her own rights to prevent her husband from divorcing her'' 
This para answers such questions. <br><br>158That is, it is better for a woman 
to make a settlement with him by yielding some of her rights and live with the 
husband with whom she had lived a part of her life than to get a divorce and 
separate from him.<br><br>159Narrow-mindedness on the part of the wife is that 
even when she knows that she has lost those qualities that make a wife 
attractive to her husband, she should expect and demand the same kind of 
treatment that is shown only to a beloved wife. On the other hand, the husband 
shall be narrow-minded if he suppresses too much the rights of the wife who has 
lost attraction for him but who still wants to live with him, and reduces her 
rights to an unbearable point. <br><br>160Allah has again appealed to the 
husband as He generally does in such matters, 'to show generosity to the wife. 
He has urged him to be generous to her, for she has been his companion for years 
even though she might have lost charm for him. He should tear God and imagine 
how he would fare if God withheld His favors from him on account of some defects 
in him. <br><br>161Allah has made it clear that the husband cannot literally 
keep equality between two or more wives because they themselves cannot be equal 
in all respects. It is too much to demand from a husband that he should mete out 
equal treatment to a beautiful wife and to an ugly wife, to a young wife and to 
an old wife, to a healthy wife and to an invalid wife and to a good natured wife 
and to an ill-natured wife. These and like things naturally make a husband more 
inclined towards one wife than towards the other. In such cases, the Islamic Law 
does not demand equal treatment between them in affection and love. What it does 
demand is that a wife should not be so neglected as to be practically reduced to 
the position of the woman who has no husband at all. If the husband does not 
divorce her for any reason or at her own request, she should at least be treated 
as a wife. It is true that under such circumstances the husband is naturally 
more inclined towards a favorite wife, but he should not, so to say, keep the 
other in such a state of suspense as if she were not his wife.<br><br>From this 
verse some people wrongly conclude that though the Qur'an allows more than one 
wife, it practically cancels this permission by asserting, ".:....it is not 
possible for you to be perfectly equitable in your treatment with all your 
wives...." They forget that this is only a part of the whole instruction and the 
Qur'an does not stop at this but adds, "....do not lean towards one wife...." As 
this Commandment takes into consideration the existence of more than one wife 
allowed by the Qur'an, it leaves no loophole of escape for the followers of 
Christian Europe from the fact that Islam does allow polygamy under certain 
conditions. <br><br>162As Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate, He will forgive 
any of the shortcomings that are unavoidable because of natural factors, 
provided that one is not guilty of deliberate injustice, and tries his best to 
be just as far as it is humanly possible<br><br>163In order to urge the Muslims 
to observe strictly the Commandments concerning justice to women and orphans, 
Allah has, as usual, in the conclusion (Ivv. 130-134) given a brief but 
effective address by way of admonition, and has impressed upon the Believers the 
following things:<br><br>(1) You should never be under the delusion that you can 
make or mar the fate of any one, and that if you withdraw or withhold your help 
and support from anyone, that person will become utterly helpless. As a matter 
of fact, your own fate and the fate of those whom you support, is entirely in 
the hands of Allah and you alone are not the only means by which He supports His 
servants or maid servants. The resources of the Owner of the earth and the 
heavens are vast and limitless and He is also All-Wise and has full power to 
adopt means for helping anyone He wills.<br><br>(2) Allah has enjoined you, as 
He always enjoined the communities of the former Prophets, to conduct your 
affairs with fear of God in your hearts. In this lies your own good and not of 
God. If you do not carry out these instructions, you can do no harm to Allah but 
you yourselves will go the way of the former disobedient communities. The 
Sovereign of the Universe has never stood in need of the people. If you will not 
behave properly, He will remove you from leadership and appoint another 
community in your place. And your removal will not in the least diminish 
anything from the greatness of His Kingdom.<br><br>(3) Allah has in His 
possession all the benefits and rewards of this world and of the Next World, 
benefits which are temporary and transitory or permanent and ever-lasting. It is 
for you to make your choice from among these according to your own capacity and 
courage. If you are enamored of the temporary good things of this world and are 
even prepared to sacrifice the permanent blessings of the Hereafter, Allah will 
bestow upon you the same here and now, but in that case, you will have no 
portion in the permanent blessings of the Hereafter. You should not forget that 
owing to your own lack of capability and lack of courage, you have chosen to 
acquire only a drop out of the ocean of the blessings of God. Therefore it is 
better for you to adopt that way of obedience and submission which may enable 
you to acquire the vast benefits of this world and of the Hereafter.<br><br>The 
concluding words of this piece of admonition, "He hears everything and sees 
everything", have a very deep significance. As Allah is neither deaf nor blind, 
He makes a fine distinction between the good and the bad in the distribution of 
His blessings. He is fully aware of what is happening in the universe over which 
He is ruling and of the capabilities, efforts and intentions of everyone. 
Therefore, one who is disobedient to Him, should not expect those blessings 
which He has reserved for those who are obedient to Him.<br><br>164The words, " 
.....be you the standard-bearers of justice", are very significant. They imply, 
"You not only have to do justice but have also to bear the standard of justice 
in order to eradicate injustice and establish right and justice in its place. As 
Believers, you have to gird up your loins to support justice, whenever your 
support is needed." <br><br>165That is, "The sole aim of your testimony should 
be to please Allah, without any tinge of partiality, self-interest, fear or 
favor in it." <br><br>166To ask believers to believe might at first seem 
strange. The fact is, however, that belief as used here has two meanings. First, 
belief denotes that a man has preferred to acknowledge the soundness of true 
guidance, to distance himself from the fold of those who disbelieve, and to join 
the camp of the believers. Second, belief denotes faith, a man's believing in 
the truth with all his heart, with full earnestness and sincerity. It denotes 
man's sincere determination to mold his way of thinking, his taste and 
temperament, his likes and dislikes, his conduct and character, his friendship 
and enmity, and the direction of his efforts and striving, in conformity with 
the creed which he has resolved to embrace. This verse is addressed to all those 
who are 'believers' in the first sense of the term, and they are asked to change 
themselves into true believers, i.e. believers in the second sense.<br><br>
167Here kufr implies two things:<br><br>(1) a person may reject Islam outright;<br>
<br>(2) one may pay lip service to Islam but may not (sincerely) believe in it 
or may show one's conduct that one does not, in fact, believe in Islam, in spite 
of one's profession.<br><br>Here kufr implies both these things, and the verse 
warns that neither kind of kufr can go side by side with the fundamental 
articles of Islamic Faith and will mislead the one who adopts it, away from the 
Truth into the paths of deviation. <br><br>168These are the people who do not 
consider Faith a serious matter but play with it like a toy to gratify their 
whims and lusts. They adopt Islam, if and when they are swayed to it by some 
fanciful notion, and become disbelievers, if another notion moves them away to 
the opposite side. Or, they become Muslims when their interests demand it and 
become disbelievers, without the least hesitation, if their interests lie in 
disbelief. Obviously, for such people there is neither forgiveness nor guidance 
from Allah. They do not stop at their own disbelief but go much further in it. 
They strive to turn other Muslims also away from Islam, conspire against it and 
make open designs to harm it so as to raise the standard of kufr high up and to 
pull down the standard of Islam. As this is an addition to the sin of one's 
personal disbelief, it deserves much severe punishment than the offense of the 
one who disbelieves in Islam but is not antagonistic to it. <br><br>169The 
Arabic word 'izzat is more comprehensive than the English word honor, "the 
regard in which one is held by one's followers". Izzat refers to such a high 
regard and secure position as is inviolable. <br><br>170The Command to the 
Believers to quit the company of the disbelievers, as soon as they get engaged 
in ridiculing Islam, is contained in v. 68 of Al-An'am which was revealed 
earlier than An-Nisa'. If a Believer sits in the company of disbelievers and 
coolly listens to the ridicule of Divine Revelations he becomes a partner in 
that blasphemy, and there remains little difference between him and the 
disbelievers. <br><br>171The hypocrites of every age have always enjoyed all the 
benefits conferred by Islam, by professing it with their tongue, and nominally 
joining the Muslim Community. At the same time they enjoy all the benefits they 
can derive from the disbelievers, by mixing with them and assuring them, "We are 
not bigoted Muslims though we are nominally connected with them. We are akin to 
you in culture, in thoughts and in the way of life and our interests and 
loyalties are the same as yours. Therefore, you should rest assured that we will 
side with you in the conflict between Islam and kufr."<br><br>172The offering of 
the Salat in congregation has been held out as a test of one's being a sincere 
Believer or a hypocrite because during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet one 
could not be considered a member of the Islamic Community unless one offered the 
Salat regularly and punctually. Just as every association or organization 
considers the absence of a member without genuine excuse from its meetings a 
sign of his lack of interest, and expels him from it for continuous absence, so 
if a Muslim absented himself from the Salat in congregation, it was considered a 
clear sign of his lack of interest in Islam. And if he continuously absented 
himself from it, this was taken as a proof of his desertion from Islam. That is 
why even the confirmed hypocrites of that time had to join the Salat in 
congregation five times a day; otherwise they could not be counted as members of 
the Islamic Community. But what distinguished them from the true Believers was 
that the true Believers went to the mosques with great enthusiasm before time 
and stayed there even after the Prayer was over which was a clear proof of their 
genuine interest in it. On the other hand, the very call to the Prayer sounded 
like a death knell to a hypocrite. He would rise up reluctantly to join the 
congregation, but his whole demeanor clearly showed that he was offering his 
Salat unwillingly. Then after the Prayer he would leave the mosque in haste as 
if he had been released from prison. Thus, all his movements showed that he had 
no interest in the remembrance of Allah. <br><br>173It declares that no human 
being has the power to guide to the right way the one who himself does not 
intend to get guidance from the Book of Allah and the excellent pattern of His 
Messenger; whom Allah turns to the wrong way to which he himself is inclined and 
shuts all the doors of guidance against him because of his own quest for 
deviation. And this happens in accordance with the Divine Law that man gets what 
he seeks and strives for. For instance, if one seeks to make one's provisions by 
lawful means and strives for the same, God provides lawful means for him and 
shuts unlawful doors against him, in proportion to the intensity of the 
sincerity of his intention. On the contrary, if one has the intention of making 
one's provisions by unlawful means and strives for the same, Allah provides him 
with the same through unlawful means. Allah alone has the power to guide any 
individual on any way whatsoever, and no one can take any course, right or 
wrong, without His permission and without His help, but He allows and helps 
every one to proceed on the way he chooses for himself. If one loves Allah and 
is a seeker after Truth and sincerely strives to follow His way, He allows him 
and helps him to think and act on the right lines leading to the right way and 
provides means for him to proceed on the same way. But if one chooses to follow 
wrong ways and strives to proceed on wrong ways, Allah shuts the way of guidance 
against him and opens before him evil ways which he chooses for himself. No one 
has the power to prevent such a one from evil thoughts and evil deeds and from 
spending his energies in evil ways. It is thus obvious that none can guide to 
the right way the wretched one who deliberately loses it and whom Allah leads 
astray in consequence of his intentional deviation.<br><br>174That person, who 
dedicates his Faith to Allah, devotes his whole life earnestly and faithfully 
for Him and reserves all his loyalties, interests, and affections for Him alone. 
In short, his attachment to Allah becomes so intense that he is ready to 
sacrifice anything for Him.<br><br>175That is, "If you show your sincere 
gratitude to Allah and do not adopt an attitude of ingratitude and treachery 
towards Him in regard to the benefits and blessings you have received from Him, 
there is no reason why He should punish you for nothing."<br><br>The right 
attitude of gratitude is that one should sincerely appreciate the kindness of 
the benefactor, acknowledge it with his tongue and show his gratitude by his 
conduct. This implies three things: First, the grateful person should attribute 
the kindness to the real benefactor and should not associate anyone else with 
him in gratitude and acknowledgment. Second, he should be full of the feelings 
of love and loyalty for his benefactor and should not cherish any such feelings 
for the opponents of the benefactor. Third, he should be obedient to his 
benefactor, and should not in any way use or employ the benefits conferred on 
him against the will of the benefactor. <br><br>176The word shakir, when applied 
to Allah, means that He appreciates the worth of the services of His servant; 
and when applied to the servant, it means that he expresses his gratitude to his 
Lord for His blessings. Allah appreciates fully the quantity and the quality of 
the services that are rendered by His servants for His cause and deprives none 
of them of the due rewards: nay, He rewards their services most generously and 
gives much more than they deserve. Of course, His treatment of His servants is 
quite different from their own treatment of their fellow-men. They 
under-estimate the worth of the services rendered by a fellow- man and take him 
to task severely for an omission. Allah in His bounty rewards much more 
generously than His servant deserves for any service rendered by him in His 
cause, but is very lenient and forgiving for any omission or neglect of duty 
shown by His servants. <br><br>177The moral instructions contained in this verse 
are of the highest standard. The Muslims have been taught to practice virtue or 
at least to show forbearance even in the face of . revocation. At the time of 
its revelation, the hypocrites, the Jews and the idolaters were all engaged in 
opposing Islam by all possible means and were maltreating its followers in every 
conceivable way. Therefore it was but natural that the Muslims should be tilled 
with feelings of anger and hatred. When Allah noticed the storm of emotion 
rising in their hearts, he warned them that He did not like that they give vent 
to their feelings, though they were wronged and therefore justified, if in 
retaliation they gave expression to their bitter feelings. They were taught that 
they, as Muslims, were expected to go on doing good openly and secretly or at 
least refrain from doing evil for evil. They were instructed, "You should try to 
mold your character after that of your Allah, Who is so Forbearing that He does 
not withhold His provisions even from the most wicked culprits and shows 
forbearance to the most sinful offenders. You should, therefore, have a big 
heart and show forbearance even in the most critical and provocative 
situations."<br><br>178That is, there is absolutely no doubt that all those 
people are equally disbelievers, who deny Allah all His Messengers: who 
acknowledge Allah but deny His Messengers: who accept some of the Messengers and 
reject others: each and everyone of such people is a confirmed disbeliever. <br>
<br>179Full assurance has been given to those who acknowledge Allah as their 
sole Sovereign and Deity, and submit to and follow all His Messengers, that they 
deserve to be rewarded according to the quality of their good deeds. In contrast 
to them, there is ignominious punishment for those who do not acknowledge Allah 
as the sole Sovereign and Sustainer, or for those who adopted the rebellious way 
by accepting some of His representatives and rejecting others. Allah does not 
accept any of the apparently good deeds of such people because it has no legal 
status in His sight. <br><br>180As Allah is Forgiving and Compassionate, He will 
be very lenient in judging the deeds of those who believe in Him and His 
Messengers and will not be hard on them.<br><br>181This was one of the strange 
demands of the Jews of Madinah. They said to the Holy Prophet, "We will not 
accept you as a Prophet unless you cause a written Book to come down to us from 
heaven before our very eyes or cause a written message to come down to each one 
of us to this effect: Muhammad (peace be upon him) is Our Messenger; so believe 
in him'."<br><br>182A mere mention of this incident has been made in the short 
list of the crimes of the Israelites to which reference has been made here to 
show how impertinent they had become. This incident has already been mentioned 
in v. 55 of AI-Baqarah (For details, please see E.N. 17, Al-Baqarah).<br><br>
183"Clear signs": the signs which the children of Israel had seen, one after the 
other, since the time of the Prophet Moses appointment as a Messenger. They had 
also witnessed the drowning of Pharaoh and his army and many other signs during 
their exodus froth Egypt. Therefore, they knew full well that it was Allah, Lord 
of the Universe, and not a calf, Who had rescued them froth the tyranny of a 
powerful ruler like Pharaoh. Yet they were so enamored of false gods that they 
forsook God, their real Benefactor, and made the calf of gold the object of 
their worship. <br><br>184"Clear Commandment": the Commandments inscribed on the 
tablets which were given to the Prophet Moses. (See also Al-Baqarah 11:63 and 
Al-A'raf V11:171).<br><br>The "Covenant" was the pledge taken from the chiefs of 
Israel at the foot of Mount Tur. This has already been mentioned in Al-Baqarah,II: 
63 and is also referred to in AI-A' raf VII:171. <br><br>185Please refer to vv. 
58-89 and E.N. 75 of Al-Baqarah. <br><br>186Please see v. 65 and E.N.'s 82 and 
83 of Al-Baqarah. <br><br>187Reference has already been made to such a saying of 
the Jews in Al Baqarah II:88. Just as all the worshipers of falsehood are proud 
of their obduracy against the truth, so were the Jews proud of their beliefs, 
prejudices, rituals and customs that they had inherited from their forefathers 
and could not be persuaded to give them up. That is why they always turned a 
deaf ear to the Message of the Prophets of Allah with the answer: "We are 
determined to reject your invitation, even though you bring strong arguments in 
support thereof. We will adhere strongly and faithfully to what we believe and 
practice." (Also see E.N. 94 of Al-Baqarah). <br><br>188This is a parenthetical 
statement.<br><br>189This is in continuation of the theme under discussion.<br>
<br>190The calumny against Mary concerning the birth of Jesus has been declared 
here as "disbelief" because it was not directed against the person of innocent 
Mary or her son but against Jesus Christ, the Messenger of God. The Jews had 
absolutely no ground for suspicion about his miraculous birth without father, 
because God had caused the whole Community to stand as witness to the miracle. 
When Virgin Mary, who belonged to the noble and well-known religious family of 
the Israelites, came home with the new-born child, a large crowd gathered there 
and demanded an explanation from her. But she simply pointed to the child. The 
crowd could not understand how a child in the cradle could speak, but to their 
utter astonishment, the child began to speak clearly and fluently and addressing 
the crowd, he declared, "I am Allah's servant: Allah has given me the Book and 
made me a Prophet." (Maryam, XIX : 30) Thus Allah cut at the very root of the 
slander about his birth. That is why none ever accused Mary of fornication nor 
taunted Jesus with being an illegitimate son until he stained his maturity. But 
when at the age of thirty, he started his mission to invite the people to the 
way of God and rebuked the Jews for their evil deeds and exposed the hypocrisies 
of their scholars and jurists and warned the whole community of the consequences 
of moral degradation, they turned against him. Instead of accepting his message 
and making sacrifices for the cause of God, and reforming their evil ways, these 
impudent and unscrupulous criminals resorted to all sorts of dirty tricks and 
devilish designs to suppress the voice of Truth. It was then that they made that 
monstrous calumny which they had never uttered before during the previous thirty 
years of his life, because they knew it for certain that Mary and her son were 
absolutely free from this taint. Thus their calumny, in fact, was not due to any 
real suspicion, which they might be harboring in their hearts, but it was a pure 
calumny, which they deliberately invented for opposing the Truth. That is why 
Allah declared it to be disbelief instead of wickedness and falsehood, for their 
real aim by this accusation was to hinder the people from the Way of God and not 
merely to slander an innocent lady. <br><br>191The fact that they bragged of 
slaying Jesus, knowing him to be a Messenger of God, shows how bold they had 
become in their crimes. We have shown in the previous Note that the miracle of 
his speech in the cradle had let no doubt whatsoever to remain in the minds of 
the Jews about his Prophethood. Then the clear signs that they witnessed from 
him (III : 49) were a conclusive proof that he was really a Prophet of God. 
Therefore their wicked behavior towards him was not the result of any 
misunderstanding about his Prophethood, but was an intentional crime against the 
one who had been appointed by Allah as Messenger.<br><br>Though it appears very 
strange that a community should slay a person whom they know to be and 
acknowledge a Prophet of Allah, yet it is so, for the ways of wicked communities 
are strange. They cannot and do not tolerate a person who criticizes them for 
their evil ways and prohibits unlawful things. Such people, even though they be 
the Prophets of Allah, have always been persecuted, imprisoned and slain by 
their own wicked people.<br><br>As a proof thereof, the following is quoted from 
the Talmud: "When the city (Jerusalem) had been captured, Nebuchadnezzar marched 
with the princes and officers of the Temple...... On one of the walls he found 
the mark of an arrow's head as though somebody had been killed or hit nearby, 
and he asked who was killed there.<br><br>"Zachariah, the son of Yehoyadah, the 
high priest", answered the people. "He rebuked us incessantly on account of our 
transgressions and we were tired of his words and put him to death."<br><br>Even 
according to the Bible, when the Prophet Jeremiah rebuked the Jews on account of 
their transgressions, they accused him of being in conspiracy with the Chaldeans 
and traitor against his people and sent him to prison. Likewise had the Jews 
treated John the Baptist a couple of years before the crucifixion of the Prophet 
Jesus. They counted John as a Prophet and acknowledged him as one of the most 
righteous men of their community, but when he criticized Herod (the ruler of 
Judea) for his evil ways, he was not tolerated. He was first sent to prison, 
then beheaded on the demand of Herod's beloved, the dancing girl.<br><br>It is, 
therefore, obvious from their record that when they presumed that they had 
crucified Jesus Christ, they bragged: "We have slain a Messenger of Allah. " <br>
<br>192This is another parenthesis. <br><br>193This verse is explicit on the 
point that the Prophet Jesus Christ was rescued from crucifixion and that the 
Christians and the Jews are both wrong in believing that he died on the cross. A 
comparative study of the Qur'an and the Bible shows that most probably it was 
Jesus himself who stood his trial in the court of Pilate, who sentenced him to 
death, but they could not kill or crucify him, for Allah raised him to Himself.<br>
<br>This is what happened, Pilate knew fully well that Christ was innocent and 
had been brought in his court out of jealousy. So he asked the crowd whether 
Jesus Christ should be released on the occasion of the Festival or Barabbas, a 
notorious robber. But the high priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for 
the release of Barabbas and for the crucifixion of Jesus. After this, God, Who 
can do any and everything He wills, raised Jesus to Himself and rescued him from 
crucifixion and the one who was crucified afterwards was somehow or other taken 
for Chris. Nevertheless, his miraculous escape does not lessen the wicked crime 
of the Jews, because they knew it well that the one, whom they crowned with a 
crown of thorns, and on whose face they spat and whom they crucified with 
disgrace was Christ, the son of Mary. As regards the matter how "it was made 
doubtful for them" that they had crucified Jesus, we have no means of 
ascertaining. Therefore it is not right to base on mere guess-work and rumors an 
answer to the question how the Jews were made to believe that they had crucified 
him, whereas in fact, Jesus, the son of Mary, had escaped from them. <br><br>
194"Those who have differed": the Christians. They do not agree in their 
versions of crucifixion. The very fact that they offer so many different 
accounts of the matter is by itself a proof that they possess no definite 
knowledge of it and are, therefore, in doubt about it. One version is that the 
person who was crucified was not Jesus but someone who bore his likeness, whom 
the Jews and the Romans had disgracefully put on the cross, while Jesus was 
standing nearby and laughing at their folly. Another version is that the one who 
was nailed to the cross was Jesus, but he did not die on the cross and was alive 
when he was taken down from it. Some others say that he died on the cross but 
came to life afterwards and met his disciples more than ten times and talked to 
them. Still others say that death due to crucifixion occurred on the physical 
body of Jesus and he was buried but the Divine Spirit within him was raised. 
There are still others who say that after his death Jesus came to life with his 
body and was raised with his body. Obviously, if the Christians had any 
knowledge of the truth, they would not have given so many different versions of 
it. <br><br>195Here Allah has told the fact of the matter. The Qur'an explicitly 
states that the Jews did not succeed in putting Jesus to death and that Allah 
raised him to Himself, but it is silent about the nature and details of the 
matter and does neither say explicitly whether Allah raised him body and soul 
together from the earth to some place in heaven, nor that he died like other 
mortals and only his soul was raised to heaven. Therefore, on the basis of the 
Qur'an neither aspect can be definitely denied or affirmed. But a study of the 
style clearly shows that whatever be the nature of being raised in any case 
Allah certainly treated the Prophet Jesus in an extraordinary way. The following 
considerations lead to the conclusion that the incident was extraordinary:<br>
<br>First, the belief in the ascension of the Prophet Jesus, body and soul 
together, was already prevalent among the Christians, and was one of the causes 
which misled a large section of them to believe in his divinity. But, in spite 
of it, the Qur'an not only has not clearly refuted it but has used the same word 
"ascension" for the incident that the Christians use for it. Had it not been an 
extraordinary incident factually the Qur'an would not have used such ambiguous 
words as help support a doctrine of the divinity of Jesus.<br><br>Second, had 
Allah meant by the words used in verse 158 that "Allah caused his death", or 
that "Allah raised him in rank", more explicit words would have been used. In 
the first case, more appropriate words would be: "No doubt they did not slay him 
nor crucified him but Allah rescued him alive from them and then gave him 
natural death", and in the second: "The Jews intended to dishonor him by 
crucifixion, but Allah raised him very high in rank", as have been used in tire 
case of the Prophet Idris: "And We raised him to a high position". (Maryam, XlX 
: 57).<br><br>Third, if the incident related here meant merely the natural death 
of Christ, the words, "And Allah is All-Powerful and All-Wise", after it would 
be meaningless. These words can be appropriately used only in connection with 
some extraordinary manifestation of the power and wisdom of Allah.<br><br>The 
only argument that can be cited in support of the interpretation of verse 158 
that Jesus died a natural death is the use of the word mutawaffika in verse 55 
of A1-`Imran, in connection with the incident. But as we have explained in the 
corresponding E.N. 51, the word is not explicit in the meaning of natural death 
but can be applied both to take the soul and to take the body and soul together. 
As there is scope for both the interpretations in this word, its use cannot 
refute the above mentioned arguments against the meaning: "Allah caused his 
death". Those who insist on this interpretation argue that there is no other 
instance in which tawaffa might have been used for the seizure of both body and 
soul together. This is meaningless, for this is the only incident of its kind in 
the whole human history. The only thing to be considered is whether this word 
may lexically be used in this sense or not. If it can be used, we have to face 
the question: Why does the Qur'an not use a direct word for death instead of a 
word which is liable to support the doctrine of Ascension, which its turn, has 
given rise to the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus'? The use of this word is a 
clear proof that there was something extraordinary about the incident. Above 
all, the doctrine of Ascension is further strengthened by the Traditions 
according to which the Prophet Jesus, son of Mary, will come again to the earth 
before the Resurrection and fight the Dajjal. (These Traditions have been cited 
in the Appendix to the commentary of Surah Al Ahzab). These categorically prove 
the second coming of Jesus. Therefore, it would be snore rational to believe 
that he is living somewhere in the universe before this second coming than that 
he lies dead and buried somewhere before his advent. <br><br>196This has been 
interpreted in two ways and both are likely. (Here by the people of the Book are 
meant the Jews and may also be the Christians). According to the first 
interpretation, as adopted in the Translation, it means: "All the people of the 
Book, alive at the time of the natural death of Christ, will have believed in 
him, that is, in his Prophethood." The second interpretation of "There shall be 
none among the people of the Book but will believe in him before his death" is 
that all the people of the Book before their death do realize and believe that 
Christ is really a Messenger of God, though that belief will be of no avail at 
the time. Both these interpretations have been put forward by several Companions 
and their followers and renowned commentators, but its real meaning is only 
known to Allah. <br><br>197That is, "In the court of God, Christ will give 
testimony against the Jews and the Christians that they rejected, neglected and 
distorted the Message brought by him." Some details of this testimony are given 
in vv. 116-117 of AI Ma'idah.<br><br>198The main theme that was broken by the 
parenthesis, which ends here, has been resumed <br><br>199It is an irony that 
the Jews, who possessed a Divine Book and the heritage of the Prophets, should 
not only have themselves discarded the way of God but also frequently stood in 
the way of God. It is a fact that they have always been opposing and placing 
obstacles in the way of those movements that have ever been started for the 
promulgation of the Truth and have been starting or helping start movements 
against the way of God. Their latest crime in this connection is Communism which 
has for the first time in history based a system of life and a system of 
government on the deliberate and explicit denial of God in open opposition to 
His Law for the eradication God-worship as its declared aims. The author of 
another perverted doctrine of the modern age, Freudianism, which has helped 
mislead the people from the way of Allah, is also a Jew. <br><br>200Here is the 
Biblical law that clearly prohibits interest: "If thou lend money to any of my 
people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither 
shalt thou lay upon him usury."<br><br>"If thou at all take thy neighbor's 
raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that time the sun goeth 
down:<br><br>For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin 
wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that 
I will hear: for I am gracious." (Exodus 22 : 25-27).<br><br>Besides this, 
interest has also been prohibited at several other places in the Torah, but in 
spite of these prohibitive decrees, the Jews, who profess to believe in the same 
Torah, are the biggest usurers in the world and have become proverbially 
notorious for their narrow-mindedness and hard-heartedness. <br><br>201Probably 
this refers to the same thing that occurs in AI-An`am, V 1:146, that is, all 
animals with claws, and the fat of sheep and oxen were forbidden to the Jews. 
Besides this, possibly it may also refer to the restrictions and hardships which 
are contained in the law books composed by their own Jurists. Indeed, it is a 
great punishment that the bounds of life should be narrowed for any community. 
(For details please see E.N. 122, Al-An`am). <br><br>202History bears witness to 
the exemplary punishment that Allah has prepared for those Jews who have 
discarded the Divine Faith and given up obedience to Allah and adopted the 
attitude of disbelief and rebellion. For the last two thousand years, they have 
never possessed a place where they could live with honor. They have been 
scattered all over the world and are treated like foreigners and disgracefully, 
cruelly and oppressively in one country or the other, and there is no place in 
the world, where they are sincerely respected, in spite of their great wealth. 
Above all, this community has remained a living object lesson for the other 
nations, for it has been kept in existence in spite of its degradation, whereas 
other nations are exterminated when they become worthless. Thus Allah is causing 
them to taste in this very world a bit of the torment of Hell where the 
evil-doers "will neither be in a state of death nor in a state of life." This is 
because they have been showing the audacity of rebelling against Allah while 
they were at the same time carrying the Book of Allah with them. As regards 
punishment in the Hereafter, it may safely be predicted that it shall be much 
more painful than this. In order to remove any misunderstanding that might arise 
regarding the existence of the State of Israel, it will be worthwhile to refer 
to v. 112 of Al-`Imran, and the corresponding E.N.90. <br><br>203The reference 
is to those learned Jews who are fully acquainted with the real nature of the 
Divine Books, who are just, fair and free from every kind of prejudice, obduracy 
and self-worship, who do not blindly follow their fore-fathers but readily 
accept the Truth that they learn from the revealed Books. Therefore they are 
able to recognize easily that the teachings of the Qur'an are the same as were 
taught by the former Prophets, and then sincerely believe in both. <br><br>
204This is to emphasize the fact that the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be peace) 
has not come with a new thing and that he does not claim to present something 
for the first time, but he has, in fact, received Guidance from the same source 
of knowledge from which all the Prophets before him had received, and that he 
too is presenting the same Truth and Reality that has always been presented by 
the Prophets, who were raised from different corners of the Earth.<br><br>The 
literal meaning of wahi is: (1) to give hint of, (2) to communicate to the mind, 
(3) to convey by covert suggestion, and (4) to send a message.<br><br>205Only a 
part of the Book of Psalms in the existing Bible consists of the Psalms of the 
Prophet David, and they bear his name. Its remaining constituent parts are the 
psalms of other people, and have been attributed to their authors. It should 
also be noted that the study of the real Zabur, the Psalms of David, shows that 
it is a Revelation of God. Likewise, additions have been made in the Book of the 
Proverbs of Solomon and the last two chapters were obviously added afterwards. 
But, in spite of this, the major portion of the Proverbs contains gems of Truth 
and Wisdom. The same is true of the Book of Job. A study of this reveals that, 
though it contains gems of wisdom, it is wrong to attribute the whole of it to 
the Prophet Job. Whereas the Qur'an and the introductory chapters of this very 
Book bear witness to the great fortitude shown by the Prophet Job, its 
subsequent chapters show that he was an embodiment of grievance against God, and 
that, in vain, did his companions try their best to convince him that God was 
not unjust.<br><br>Besides these, the major portions of the seventeen Books of 
the Israelite Prophets in the Old Testament are evidently genuine Revelations; 
especially the Books of Joshua, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos and some others contain 
many such passages that show the grandeur of Divine Revelation and move one to 
ecstasy. Their high moral teachings, their campaign against idolatry and their 
sound arguments prove the Oneness of God, and their strong criticism of the 
degeneration of Israel clearly shows that these and the sermons of Jesus Christ 
in the New Testament and the Qur'an came from one and the same source.<br><br>
206The way Revelation was communicated to the Prophet Moses was different from 
that of the other Prophets. They heard either a voice or a Message from an 
angel, but the Prophet Moses had this privilege that Allah Himself had a direct 
talk with him as in a dialogue, e.g., the dialogue cited in Ta Ha, XX :11-48 in 
the Qur'an. This privilege has also been mentioned in the Bible: "......And the 
Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend." (Exodus 
33:11). <br><br>207That is, all the Prophets had one and the same mission. They 
gave good news to those who believed in the Divine Message and mended their ways 
in accordance with it and warning to those who adopted wrong ways of thought and 
action that they would meet with serious sequences in the end. <br><br>208The 
Prophets were sent with the sole object that they should set forth before 
mankind the Right Way, both theoretically and practically, so that on the Day of 
Judgment no evil-doer should be in a position to offer the excuse that he was 
ignorant of the Truth. That is why Allah appointed Messengers in different parts 
of the world and sent down Books. These Messengers imparted the knowledge of the 
truth to a large number of people and left behind them Books of which one or the 
other has always existed for the guidance of mankind. Now if one goes astray in 
spite of this arrangement, one cannot throw the blame on Allah and His 
Messengers. He himself is responsible for this because he did not accept the 
Truth when it came to him, or the responsibility is of those who had the 
knowledge of it but did not impart it to others who had gone astray. <br><br>
209That is, "You will harm none but yourselves by your disbelief and 
disobedience, for you can do no harm to the Master of the heavens and the 
earth."<br><br>210That is, "Your Allah is fully aware of everything: you cannot 
do mischief with impunity in His Kingdom; He is also Wise: He knows how to deal 
with those who disobey His Commands."<br><br>211Here "The people of the Book" 
refers to the Christians who went beyond the bounds in their religion and 
regarded Jesus as God in their exaggerated reverence and love of him. This was a 
contrast to the Jews (the other people of the Book) who had gone to the other 
extreme in their denial of an enmity against Jesus. <br><br>212The Prophet Jesus 
has specially been called God's "Command" (Kalimah) because he was born without 
the usual agency of a father. God sent a Command that Mary should become 
pregnant without the semen of a man and she conceived. Although in the very 
beginning, the Christians were told that Christ had been born without a father 
by the Command of God, yet they were so misled by the Alexandrian Philosophy of 
Philo that they first mistook Kalimah (Command) for the "Divine Word"; then 
changed the "Divine Word" into the "Logos"; then they built on the Logos 
Doctrine which misguided them to the false belief in the divine nature of Jesus 
Christ. That is how they came to believe that God had revealed Himself or His 
eternal attribute of speech in the person of Jesus. (See John I : 1, 14). <br>
<br>213Here Jesus has been called "A spirit from God" and in Al-Baqarah, 11 : 
253, it is stated that God supported him (Jesus) with the "Holy Spirit". In both 
cases, it means that Allah had bestowed upon the Prophet Jesus a Holy Spirit 
that .was imbued with high moral values and was a perfection of truth and 
righteousness without any tinge of evil. The Christians were taught this very 
thing, but they exaggerated the notion: they took "a spirit from God" for "the 
Spirit of God" and perverted the meaning of the Holy Ghost into "the Spirit of 
God Himself" which had entered into Jesus Christ. Thus, a third god, "the Holy 
Ghost", was created along with God and Christ. This was their second 
transgression which led the Christians astray.<br><br>The perversion of "a 
spirit from God" into "the Spirit of God" (Holy Ghost) has been made in spite of 
the fact that according to the Gospel of Matthew, "The angel of the Lord 
appeared unto him (Joseph) in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear 
not to take unto thee Mary, thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of 
the Holy Ghost," and not the Holy Ghost (1 : 20). <br><br>214That is, "As Jesus 
is only a spirit from God and has no part of Godhead in him, do not go beyond 
the bounds but believe in Allah as One God and accept all His Messengers 
including the Messiah." This was what the Prophet Jesus himself really taught 
and this is the truth which a true Christian should believe. <br><br>215The 
Christians have been rebuked for their wrong belief in the doctrine of the 
Trinity and advised to refrain from transgression. Strange though it may appear, 
the fact is that the Christians believe both in the Oneness of God and in the 
Trinity at one and the same time; for no Christian can deny that according to 
the clear sayings of Jesus in the Gospels, God is One Being and there is no 
other god than He. They cannot but admit that Unity of God is the real basis of 
religion. But the introduction of the doctrine of the Logos at an early stage of 
Christianity misled them into believing in the Godhead of Christ in union with 
God and the Holy Ghost. Since then it has always remained an enigma for them to 
reconcile these two contradictory doctrines and for the last eighteen hundred 
years or so the Christian scholars have been vainly engaged in solving this 
self-created baffling puzzle. Not only this, many Christian denominations have 
been founded upon different interpretations of this doctrine and it has given 
rise to many religious disputes in which one denomination accuses the other of 
blasphemy. In short, their scholars and interpreters have been spending all 
their efforts and energies in solving this enigma which was neither created by 
God nor by Christ. It is also obvious that there is no solution to it, because 
no one can prove that three persons share Godhead and also that God is One Being 
and has no partners in His Godhead. As this enigma is the result of their own 
transgression beyond the Divine limits, it can only be solved if they refrain 
from going beyond the limits and give up the belief of the Godhead of the 
Messiah and of the Holy Ghost, and acknowledge Allah as the sole object of 
worship, adoration and devotion and believe in the Messiah as a Messenger of God 
and not as a partner in the Godhead of Allah. <br><br>216This refutes the fourth 
transgression of the Christians who believed that Christ was the Son of God. In 
this belief they had gone beyond the limits of their own religion. According to 
the first three Books of The New Testament (even if the traditions therein be 
accepted as authentic), the Prophet Jesus merely likened the relationship 
between Man and Allah to the relationship between father and son, and used the 
word father for God metaphorically, just as it was in vogue among the 
Israelites. There are many instances of this in the Old Testament the Prophet 
Jesus also used the word "father" in the sense it was used by his people. He 
called God not only his father but the father of all human beings. But, the 
Christians again went beyond the limits and declared Jesus to be the only Son of 
God. They based this strange belief on the assumption that Messiah was the 
manifestation of God and the incarnation of His Word and His Holy Ghost. They 
also transgressed in believing that God had sent His only Son to the earth so 
that he might take the burden of the sins of mankind on his own shoulders and go 
to his crucifixion and atone for the sins of Man with his own blood. Obviously, 
this belief is the creation of their own imagination, for there is no saying of 
Christ to support this.<br><br>Here, Allah has not refuted the doctrine of the 
"Atonement" because it is not a fundamental article of the Christian religion, 
but is a mere bye-product of (a) the belief that Christ is the Son of God and 
(b) a philosophical and mystical explanation of the objection that if Christ was 
the Son of God, why did he die a cursed death of crucifixion? It is thus obvious 
that this doctrine is refuted automatically, if it is shown that Christ was not 
the Son of God and that he did not die on the cross. <br><br>217As all things in 
the heavens and the earth belong to Allah, none of them has any such relation 
with Him as of father and son, but only that of Master and slave. <br><br>
218Allah suffices for the management of His Kingdom and does not stand in need 
of the help of a son for this purpose.<br><br>219Verse 176 was sent down long 
after the revelation of this Surah; so much so that according to some traditions 
this was the last verse of the Qur'an. Anyhow, according to most authentic 
traditions, it was revealed in A.H. 9 when An-Nisa' was already being recited as 
a complete Surah. That is why this verse was not included in the verses about 
inheritance contained in the first portion of the Surah, but was added to it as 
an appendix. <br><br>220There is a difference of opinion about the meaning of 
kalalah. According to some scholars, kalalah is the person who dies childless 
and whose father and grandfather also are dead. But according to others, kalalah 
is one who dies childless irrespective of whether his father and grandfather are 
alive or dead. Hadrat `Umar also could not come to any definite decision about 
its meaning till the last. The majority of the jurists, however, have accepted 
the opinion of Hadrat Abu Bakr that kalalah is the person who dies childless and 
whose father and grandfather had died before his death. This opinion is also 
supported by the Qur'an which awards half of the inheritance of the kalalah to 
the sister who cannot be entitled to any share at all if the father is alive.
<br><br>221There is a consensus of opinion that this refers to the inheritance 
of sisters and brothers who have the relation of common parents or only common 
father with the deceased. Once Hadrat Abu Bakr gave this- explanation and none 
of the Companions differed from it. <br><br>222The brother will inherit the 
whole inheritance in case there is no other heir to it. For instance, if the 
husband of the childless woman is alive her brother will be entitled to the 
whole of the remaining inheritance after the payment of the share of the 
husband.<br><br>223The same also applies to the case of more than two sisters.<p></p>
