                  <li class="collection-item"> A. L. R. (This is) a Book, with verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning), further explained in detail,- from One Who is Wise and Well-acquainted (with all things):</li><li class="collection-item"> (It teacheth) that ye should worship none but Allah. (Say): "Verily I am (sent) unto you from Him to warn and to bring glad tidings:</li><li class="collection-item"> "(And to preach thus), ´Seek ye the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance; that He may grant you enjoyment, good (and true), for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace on all who abound in merit! But if ye turn away, then I fear for you the penalty of a great day:</li><li class="collection-item"> ´To Allah is your return, and He hath power over all things.´"</li><li class="collection-item"> Behold! they fold up their hearts, that they may lie hid from Him! Ah even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knoweth what they conceal, and what they reveal: for He knoweth well the (inmost secrets) of the hearts.</li><li class="collection-item"> There is no moving creature on earth but its sustenance dependeth on Allah: He knoweth the time and place of its definite abode and its temporary deposit: All is in a clear Record.</li><li class="collection-item"> He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was over the waters - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct. But if thou wert to say to them, "Ye shall indeed be raised up after death", the Unbelievers would be sure to say, "This is nothing but obvious sorcery!"</li><li class="collection-item"> If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, "What keeps it back?" Ah! On the day it (actually) reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!</li><li class="collection-item"> If We give man a taste of Mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it from him, behold! he is in despair and (falls into) blasphemy.</li><li class="collection-item"> But if We give him a taste of (Our) favours after adversity hath touched him, he is sure to say, "All evil has departed from me:" Behold! he falls into exultation and pride.</li><li class="collection-item"> Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness; for them is forgiveness (of sins) and a great reward.</li><li class="collection-item"> Perchance thou mayest (feel the inclination) to give up a part of what is revealed unto thee, and thy heart feeleth straitened lest they say, "Why is not a treasure sent down unto him, or why does not an angel come down with him?" But thou art there only to warn! It is Allah that arrangeth all affairs!</li><li class="collection-item"> Or they may say, "He forged it," Say, "Bring ye then ten suras forged, like unto it, and call (to your aid) whomsoever ye can, other than Allah!- If ye speak the truth!</li><li class="collection-item"> "If then they (your false gods) answer not your (call), know ye that this revelation is sent down (replete) with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god but He! will ye even then submit (to Islam)?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter,- to them we shall pay (the price of) their deeds therein,- without diminution.</li><li class="collection-item"> They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: vain are the designs they frame therein, and of no effect and the deeds that they do!</li><li class="collection-item"> Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it,- a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe!</li><li class="collection-item"> Who doth more wrong than those who invent a life against Allah? They will be turned back to the presence of their Lord, and the witnesses will say, "These are the ones who lied against their Lord! Behold! the Curse of Allah is on those who do wrong!-</li><li class="collection-item"> "Those who would hinder (men) from the path of Allah and would seek in it something crooked: these were they who denied the Hereafter!"</li><li class="collection-item"> They will in no wise frustrate (His design) on earth, nor have they protectors besides Allah! Their penalty will be doubled! They lost the power to hear, and they did not see!</li><li class="collection-item"> They are the ones who have lost their own souls: and the (fancies) they invented have left them in the lurch!</li><li class="collection-item"> Without a doubt, these are the very ones who will lose most in the Hereafter!</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who believe and work righteousness, and humble themselves before their Lord,- They will be companions of the gardens, to dwell therein for aye!</li><li class="collection-item"> These two kinds (of men) may be compared to the blind and deaf, and those who can see and hear well. Are they equal when compared? Will ye not then take heed?</li><li class="collection-item"> We sent Noah to his people (with a mission): "I have come to you with a Clear Warning:</li><li class="collection-item"> "That ye serve none but Allah: Verily I do fear for you the penalty of a grievous day."</li><li class="collection-item"> But the chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: "We see (in) thee nothing but a man like ourselves: Nor do we see that any follow thee but the meanest among us, in judgment immature: Nor do we see in you (all) any merit above us: in fact we think ye are liars!"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "O my people! See ye if (it be that) I have a Clear Sign from my Lord, and that He hath sent Mercy unto me from His own presence, but that the Mercy hath been obscured from your sight? shall we compel you to accept it when ye are averse to it?</li><li class="collection-item"> "And O my people! I ask you for no wealth in return: my reward is from none but Allah: But I will not drive away (in contempt) those who believe: for verily they are to meet their Lord, and ye I see are the ignorant ones!</li><li class="collection-item"> "And O my people! who would help me against Allah if I drove them away? Will ye not then take heed?</li><li class="collection-item"> "I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor claim I to be an angel. Nor yet do I say, of those whom your eyes do despise that Allah will not grant them (all) that is good: Allah knoweth best what is in their souls: I should, if I did, indeed be a wrong-doer."</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "O Noah! thou hast disputed with us, and (much) hast thou prolonged the dispute with us: now bring upon us what thou threatenest us with, if thou speakest the truth!?"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "Truly, Allah will bring it on you if He wills,- and then, ye will not be able to frustrate it!</li><li class="collection-item"> "Of no profit will be my counsel to you, much as I desire to give you (good) counsel, if it be that Allah willeth to leave you astray: He is your Lord! and to Him will ye return!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say: "If I had forged it, on me were my sin! and I am free of the sins of which ye are guilty!</li><li class="collection-item"> It was revealed to Noah: "None of thy people will believe except those who have believed already! So grieve no longer over their (evil) deeds.</li><li class="collection-item"> "But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no (further) on behalf of those who are in sin: for they are about to be overwhelmed (in the Flood)."</li><li class="collection-item"> Forthwith he (starts) constructing the Ark: Every time that the chiefs of his people passed by him, they threw ridicule on him. He said: "If ye ridicule us now, we (in our turn) can look down on you with ridicule likewise!</li><li class="collection-item"> "But soon will ye know who it is on whom will descend a penalty that will cover them with shame,- on whom will be unloosed a penalty lasting:"</li><li class="collection-item"> At length, behold! there came Our command, and the fountains of the earth gushed forth! We said: "Embark therein, of each kind two, male and female, and your family - except those against whom the word has already gone forth,- and the Believers." but only a few believed with him.</li><li class="collection-item"> So he said: "Embark ye on the Ark, In the name of Allah, whether it move or be at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"</li><li class="collection-item"> So the Ark floated with them on the waves (towering) like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself (from the rest): "O my son! embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers!"</li><li class="collection-item"> The son replied: "I will betake myself to some mountain: it will save me from the water." Noah said: "This day nothing can save, from the command of Allah, any but those on whom He hath mercy! "And the waves came between them, and the son was among those overwhelmed in the Flood.</li><li class="collection-item"> Then the word went forth: "O earth! swallow up thy water, and O sky! Withhold (thy rain)!" and the water abated, and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word went forth: "Away with those who do wrong!"</li><li class="collection-item"> And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: "O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the justest of Judges!"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lest thou act like the ignorant!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Noah said: "O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee, lest I ask Thee for that of which I have no knowledge. And unless thou forgive me and have Mercy on me, I should indeed be lost!"</li><li class="collection-item"> The word came: "O Noah! Come down (from the Ark) with peace from Us, and blessing on thee and on some of the peoples (who will spring) from those with thee: but (there will be other) peoples to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end will a grievous penalty reach them from Us."</li><li class="collection-item"> Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which We have revealed unto thee: before this, neither thou nor thy people knew them. So persevere patiently: for the End is for those who are righteous.</li><li class="collection-item"> To the ´Ad People (We sent) Hud, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him. (Your other gods) ye do nothing but invent!</li><li class="collection-item"> "O my people! I ask of you no reward for this (Message). My reward is from none but Him who created me: Will ye not then understand?</li><li class="collection-item"> "And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him (in repentance): He will send you the skies pouring abundant rain, and add strength to your strength: so turn ye not back in sin!"</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "O Hud! No Clear (Sign) that hast thou brought us, and we are not the ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee!</li><li class="collection-item"> "We say nothing but that (perhaps) some of our gods may have seized thee with imbecility." He said: "I call Allah to witness, and do ye bear witness, that I am free from the sin of ascribing, to Him,</li><li class="collection-item"> "Other gods as partners! so scheme (your worst) against me, all of you, and give me no respite.</li><li class="collection-item"> "I put my trust in Allah, My Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He hath grasp of its fore-lock. Verily, it is my Lord that is on a straight Path.</li><li class="collection-item"> "If ye turn away,- I (at least) have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another people to succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. For my Lord hath care and watch over all things."</li><li class="collection-item"> So when Our decree issued, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves: We saved them from a severe penalty.</li><li class="collection-item"> Such were the ´Ad People: they rejected the Signs of their Lord and Cherisher; disobeyed His messengers; And followed the command of every powerful, obstinate transgressor.</li><li class="collection-item"> And they were pursued by a Curse in this life,- and on the Day of Judgment. Ah! Behold! for the ´Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were ´Ad the people of Hud!</li><li class="collection-item"> To the Thamud People (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him (in repentance): for my Lord is (always) near, ready to answer."</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "O Salih! thou hast been of us! a centre of our hopes hitherto! dost thou (now) forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped? But we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which thou invitest us."</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "O my people! do ye see? if I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself,- who then can help me against Allah if I were to disobey Him? What then would ye add to my (portion) but perdition?</li><li class="collection-item"> "And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a symbol to you: leave her to feed on Allah´s (free) earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penalty will seize you!"</li><li class="collection-item"> But they did ham-string her. So he said: "Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: (Then will be your ruin): (Behold) there a promise not to be belied!"</li><li class="collection-item"> When Our Decree issued, We saved Salih and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves - and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord - He is the Strong One, and able to enforce His Will.</li><li class="collection-item"> The (mighty) Blast overtook the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning,-</li><li class="collection-item"> As if they had never dwelt and flourished there. Ah! Behold! for the Thamud rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were the Thamud!</li><li class="collection-item"> There came Our messengers to Abraham with glad tidings. They said, "Peace!" He answered, "Peace!" and hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.</li><li class="collection-item"> But when he saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: "Fear not: We have been sent against the people of Lut."</li><li class="collection-item"> And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed: But we gave her glad tidings of Isaac, and after him, of Jacob.</li><li class="collection-item"> She said: "Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!"</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "Dost thou wonder at Allah´s decree? The grace of Allah and His blessings on you, o ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory!"</li><li class="collection-item"> When fear had passed from (the mind of) Abraham and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with us for Lut´s people.</li><li class="collection-item"> For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing (of faults), compassionate, and given to look to Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> O Abraham! Seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth: for them there cometh a penalty that cannot be turned back!</li><li class="collection-item"> When Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless (to protect) them. He said: "This is a distressful day."</li><li class="collection-item"> And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habit of practising abominations. He said: "O my people! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear Allah, and cover me not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?"</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "Well dost thou know we have no need of thy daughters: indeed thou knowest quite well what we want!"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "Would that I had power to suppress you or that I could betake myself to some powerful support."</li><li class="collection-item"> (The Messengers) said: "O Lut! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no means shall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the night remains, and let not any of you look back: but thy wife (will remain behind): To her will happen what happens to the people. Morning is their time appointed: Is not the morning nigh?"</li><li class="collection-item"> When Our Decree issued, We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,-</li><li class="collection-item"> Marked as from thy Lord: Nor are they ever far from those who do wrong!</li><li class="collection-item"> To the Madyan People (We sent) Shu´aib, one of their own brethren: he said: "O my people! worship Allah: Ye have no other god but Him. And give not short measure or weight: I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the penalty of a day that will compass (you) all round.</li><li class="collection-item"> "And O my people! give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due: commit not evil in the land with intent to do mischief.</li><li class="collection-item"> "That which is left you by Allah is best for you, if ye (but) believed! but I am not set over you to keep watch!"</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "O Shu´aib! Does thy (religion of) prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practised, or that we leave off doing what we like with our property? truly, thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right-minded!"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "O my people! see ye whether I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord, and He hath given me sustenance (pure and) good as from Himself? I wish not, in opposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do. I only desire (your) betterment to the best of my power; and my success (in my task) can only come from Allah. In Him I trust, and unto Him I look.</li><li class="collection-item"> "And O my people! let not my dissent (from you) cause you to sin, lest ye suffer a fate similar to that of the people of Noah or of Hud or of Salih, nor are the people of Lut far off from you!</li><li class="collection-item"> "But ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn unto Him (in repentance): For my Lord is indeed full of mercy and loving-kindness."</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "O Shu´aib! much of what thou sayest we do not understand! In fact among us we see that thou hast no strength! Were it not for thy family, we should certainly have stoned thee! for thou hast among us no great position!"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "O my people! is then my family of more consideration with you than Allah? For ye cast Him away behind your backs (with contempt). But verily my Lord encompasseth on all sides all that ye do!</li><li class="collection-item"> "And O my people! Do whatever ye can: I will do (my part): Soon will ye know who it is on whom descends the penalty of ignominy; and who is a liar! and watch ye! for I too am watching with you!"</li><li class="collection-item"> When Our decree issued, We saved Shu´aib and those who believed with him, by (special) mercy from Ourselves: But the (mighty) blast did seize the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes by the morning,-</li><li class="collection-item"> As if they had never dwelt and flourished there! Ah! Behold! How the Madyan were removed (from sight) as were removed the Thamud!</li><li class="collection-item"> And we sent Moses, with Our Clear (Signs) and an authority manifest,</li><li class="collection-item"> Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs: but they followed the command of Pharaoh and the command of Pharaoh was no right (guide).</li><li class="collection-item"> He will go before his people on the Day of Judgment, and lead them into the Fire (as cattle are led to water): But woeful indeed will be the place to which they are led!</li><li class="collection-item"> And they are followed by a curse in this (life) and on the Day of Judgment: and woeful is the gift which shall be given (unto them)!</li><li class="collection-item"> These are some of the stories of communities which We relate unto thee: of them some are standing, and some have been mown down (by the sickle of time).</li><li class="collection-item"> It was not We that wronged them: They wronged their own souls: the deities, other than Allah, whom they invoked, profited them no whit when there issued the decree of thy Lord: Nor did they add aught (to their lot) but perdition!</li><li class="collection-item"> Such is the chastisement of thy Lord when He chastises communities in the midst of their wrong: grievous, indeed, and severe is His chastisement.</li><li class="collection-item"> In that is a Sign for those who fear the penalty of the Hereafter: that is a Day for which mankind will be gathered together: that will be a Day of Testimony.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor shall We delay it but for a term appointed.</li><li class="collection-item"> The day it arrives, no soul shall speak except by His leave: of those (gathered) some will be wretched and some will be blessed.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire: There will be for them therein (nothing but) the heaving of sighs and sobs:</li><li class="collection-item"> They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: for thy Lord is the (sure) accomplisher of what He planneth.</li><li class="collection-item"> And those who are blessed shall be in the Garden: They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as thy Lord willeth: a gift without break.</li><li class="collection-item"> Be not then in doubt as to what these men worship. They worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before (them): but verily We shall pay them back (in full) their portion without (the least) abatement.</li><li class="collection-item"> We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose therein: had it not been that a word had gone forth before from thy Lord, the matter would have been decided between them, but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it.</li><li class="collection-item"> And, of a surety, to all will your Lord pay back (in full the recompense) of their deeds: for He knoweth well all that they do.</li><li class="collection-item"> Therefore stand firm (in the straight Path) as thou art commanded,- thou and those who with thee turn (unto Allah); and transgress not (from the Path): for He seeth well all that ye do.</li><li class="collection-item"> And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you; and ye have no protectors other than Allah, nor shall ye be helped.</li><li class="collection-item"> And establish regular prayers at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night: For those things, that are good remove those that are evil: Be that the word of remembrance to those who remember (their Lord):</li><li class="collection-item"> And be steadfast in patience; for verily Allah will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.</li><li class="collection-item"> Why were there not, among the generations before you, persons possessed of balanced good sense, prohibiting (men) from mischief in the earth - except a few among them whom We saved (from harm)? But the wrong-doers pursued the enjoyment of the good things of life which were given them, and persisted in sin.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor would thy Lord be the One to destroy communities for a single wrong-doing, if its members were likely to mend.</li><li class="collection-item"> If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one people: but they will not cease to dispute.</li><li class="collection-item"> Except those on whom thy Lord hath bestowed His Mercy: and for this did He create them: and the Word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled: "I will fill Hell with jinns and men all together."</li><li class="collection-item"> All that we relate to thee of the stories of the messengers,- with it We make firm thy heart: in them there cometh to thee the Truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say to those who do not believe: "Do what ever ye can: We shall do our part;</li><li class="collection-item"> "And wait ye! We too shall wait."</li><li class="collection-item"> To Allah do belong the unseen (secrets) of the heavens and the earth, and to Him goeth back every affair (for decision): then worship Him, and put thy trust in Him: and thy Lord is not unmindful of aught that ye do.</li>

                      <strong>Name</strong><br><br>This Surah has been named after Prophet Hud 
whose story has been related in vv. 50-60.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br>
<br>If we consider its theme deeply, we come to the conclusion that it was 
revealed during the same period as Surah Yunus and most probably followed it 
immediately.<br><br><strong>Subject</strong><br><br>The Surah deals with the 
same subject as Surah Yunus, that is, invitation to the Message, admonition and 
warning, with this difference that the warning is sterner. This is also 
supported by a Tradition:<br><br>It is related that after its revelation, once 
Hadrat Abu Bakr said to the Holy Prophet, "Of late I have been noticing that you 
are growing older and older. What is the cause of it?" The Holy Prophet replied, 
"Surah Hud and the like Surahs have made me old." This shows that it was a very 
hard time for the Holy Prophet and these stern warnings added greatly to his 
anxieties that were caused by the persecution from the Quraish, who were doing 
their worst to crush down the Message of Islam. For it was obvious to the Holy 
Prophet that the last limit of the respite given by Allah was approaching nearer 
and nearer and he was afraid lest the term of the respite should expire and his 
people be seized by the torment.<br><br>The invitation is this: Obey the 
Messenger of Allah; discard shirk, and worship Allah and Allah alone: establish 
the entire system of your life on the belief that you shall be called to account 
in the Hereafter.<br><br>The admonition is this: Remember that those people who 
put their faith in the outward appearance of this worldly life and rejected the 
Message of the Prophets met with dire consequences. Therefore you should 
consider it seriously whether you should follow the same way that history has 
proved to be the path to ruin.<br><br>The warning is this: You should not be 
deluded by the delay in the coming of the punishment: it is because of the 
respite that Allah has granted you by His grace so that you might mend your 
ways: if you do not make use of this opportunity, you shall be inflicted with an 
inevitable punishment that will destroy you all except the Believers.<br><br>
Instead of addressing the people directly, the Quran has used the stories of the 
people of Noah, Hud, Salih, Lot, Shu'aib and Moses to achieve the above 
mentioned objects. What is most prominent in their stories is that when Allah 
passes His judgment on the people, He does not spare anyone whatsoever, even if 
he be the nearest relative of the Prophet of the time. Only that one is rescued 
who had believed in the Prophet, and none else, not even his own son or wife. 
More than that: the Faith demands from each and every Believer that he should 
totally forget his relationships when that judgment comes and remember only the 
relationship of the Faith. For it is against the spirit of Islam to show any 
regard whatsoever for the relationships of blood and race. And the Muslims 
demonstrated these teachings practically in the Battle of Badr, four years after 
the revelation of this Surah.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Arabic word (kitab) has been translated into "Edict" because of the 
context. For its meaning is not confined to "book" or "something written" but it 
includes "command" and "sovereign decree" as well and has been used in several 
places in the Qur'an in the same sense. <br><br>2The contents of this "Edict" 
are firm, strong, and unchangeable: they are well-balanced and measured: there 
is no tinge of verbosity, pedantry. volubility, poetic fancy and rhetorical 
exaggeration. The truth has been stated accurately, and there is nothing more 
and nothing less than the truth. Moreover. the contents have been given in 
detail and everything has been made so clear and plain that there is neither 
confusion nor complication nor ambiguity in it. <br><br>3The assurance that "He 
will provide you with good provisions of life. . . " has been given to remove 
the misunderstanding which Satan has imbued in the heart of every foolish 
worshiper of the world that piety ruins one's worldly life, though it might lead 
to one's success in the Hereafter. Allah has re-assured the true believers that 
He will shower His blessings on God-fearing people and they will live happy and 
peaceful lives and will be honored and respected everywhere. The same thing has 
been stated in a different manner in XVI: 97: "Whoso will do good deeds, whether 
a man or a woman, provided the one is a believer, We will surely make such a one 
lead a pure and clean life in this world." Allah has refuted this theory of 
Satan and his disciples that piety inevitably brings poverty, distress and 
affliction and ignominy to the person who adopts truth, righteousness and 
virtue. He has assured that He will make the life of the one who will believe in 
Him and adopt a righteous life truly successful both in this world and in the 
Hereafter. And it is common experience that only those people enjoy real peace 
of mind and are honored and respected who are God-fearing and possess a pure 
character; who are fair and generous in all their affairs and dealings and who 
are free from evil. For they are trusted by all and none fears any wrong or 
wickedness from them.<br><br>According to the Qur'an, the provisions of life are 
either "good provisions" or "deceptive provisions." Here those, who return to 
Allah, have been assured that they will be given "good provisions" of life and 
not "deceptive ones". The provisions are "good" if their recipient becomes even 
more grateful to Allah than before and uses these for fulfilling His rights and 
the rights of mankind and of his own self. Such "good provisions" snake his life 
truly successful in this world and also in the Next World. On the contrary, the 
provisions are "deceptive", if they become a temptation for the recipient, and 
get him involved in the worship of the things of this world more than before. 
Though "the deceptive provisions" might appear to be a blessing and a "favor", 
these are, in fact, a curse and means of some future torment. <br><br>4This 
verse enunciates a fundamental Divine Principle. The higher a person rises in 
character and conduct, the higher is the rank he obtains in the sight of Allah. 
That is to say that Allah does not let go waste the good deed of anyone. He does 
neither appreciate any evil deed, nor detracts from any good deed. Everyone will 
be given the honor which he deserves for his deeds.<br><br>5They were those 
people of Makkah, who though not very active in their antagonism against the 
Message of the Holy Prophet, nevertheless were very averse to it. Therefore they 
did not like to hear it nor come face to face with him, and did their very best 
to avoid him. If, by chance, they found him sitting somewhere and talking to the 
people, they would at once turn back on their heels. Or if they saw him coming 
towards themselves they would slink away or hide their faces with cloth for fear 
that he might address them and convey his Message to them. As they did not have 
the courage to face the. Truth, they would bury their heads ostrich-like and 
make believe that the Reality from which they were hiding had disappeared, 
whereas it was all along there and watching their ridiculous attempts to hide 
from it. <br><br>6That is, "It is foolish on your part to deceive yourselves 
that you can escape punishment by hiding yourselves from Allah Who has full and 
perfect. knowledge of everything: Who knows the nest where the tiniest sparrow 
lives and the hole where the smallest insect resides, and provides their 
sustenance to them wherever they be: Who knows the dwelling place and the final 
resting place of every creature and gives life and death to them at the 
appointed time. Do you think that by hiding yourselves from His Messenger, you 
can also hide yourselves from the All-Knowing Sovereign Who has sent him? Do you 
think that Allah does not see His Messenger doing his very best to convey His 
Message to you and you are trying to turn a deaf ear to it?"<br><br>7This is a 
parenthetical clause that has probably been inserted in answer to a question, 
which has not been cited: if the heavens and the earth were created afterwards 
in six days, what was there before their creation? The answer is: then there was 
water. It is not possible for us to say what exactly was the nature of that 
water. It might have been the common fluid known by that name. Or perhaps, the 
word "water" has been used as a symbol for the fluid state of the matter before 
it was changed to its present form. As regards "His Throne rested on water," I 
am of the opinion that it means: "His Kingdom was over water."<br><br>8This 
enunciates the purpose of the Creation: Allah created the heavens and the earth 
for the sake of the creation of mankind and He created mankind to rest human 
beings by delegating to them the powers of vicegerency and making them morally 
responsible for using or abusing them, just as they liked. Thus it has been 
emphasized that the sole purpose of the Creation is the moral trial of man and 
his consequent accountability to the Creator for the use or abuse of the 
delegated powers, and the award of rewards and punishments. For without this 
basic purpose, the whole work of Creation would have become meaningless and 
useless. <br><br>9That is, "The disbelievers very foolishly considered the 
purpose of the Creation to be no more than a pastime in which they themselves 
were mere playthings. They were so absorbed in their foolish conception that 
when the Holy Prophet told. them what the real purpose of Creation was and what 
part they were required to play in it, they would scoff at him, saying, "Your 
Message is like a piece of sorcery and beyond our understanding."<br><br>10This 
disgraceful characteristic of man has been mentioned here because the 
disbelievers were exhibiting it at that time. When the Holy Prophet warned them 
of the consequences of their disobedience to Allah, they would scoff at hire as 
if to say, "Arc you mad? Can't you see our prosperity and power? We are enjoying 
all the good things of life and dominating over everything and everyone all 
around us. How is it that you are prophesying torment for us?"<br><br>The 
above-mentioned arrogant behavior was due to the disgraceful human 
characteristic which has been mentioned in this verse. It is this: Man is, by 
nature, shallow and superficial and lacks the depth of thought. Therefore, when 
he enjoys prosperity and power he becomes joyous, arrogant and boastful; so much 
so that he never even dreams of any possibility that his happy condition would 
ever come to an end. And if and when adversity befalls him, he becomes an 
embodiment of despair and begins to complain of his misfortune here, there, and 
everywhere; so much so that he does not hesitate even to abuse God and taunt at 
His Godhead. But whenever there is a change for the better in his fortune, he 
again begins to brag of his foresight, wisdom and success. That is why the 
disbelievers were exhibiting such a shallow and superficial characteristic in 
answer to the warning of the Holy Prophet. They forgot that Allah was deferring 
their punishment because of His mercy to give them sufficient time to consider 
well their absurd attitude and mend their ways during the respite given to them, 
and not to delude themselves by imagining that their prosperity had very deep 
foundations and would last for ever.<br><br>11Here (sabr) (fortitude) implies 
another meaning also, that is, "steadfastness" the antonym of shallowness etc., 
that has been mentioned in the preceding verse. Those "who are steadfast" remain 
fine and unwavering in their purpose in spite of the vicissitudes of life. They 
are not influenced by the changes of circumstances, but stick to the right, 
reasonable and correct attitudes they have adopted. They do rot give themselves 
airs nor become intoxicated nor over-jubilant and boastful, if they win power, 
prosperity and name. On the contrary, they are neither subdued nor depressed if 
they are visited by adversity. In short, they come out successful in their trial 
by Allah, whether it be in the shape of favor or adversity and remain steadfast 
in both the cases. <br><br>12This is the favor that Allah shows to such people; 
He forgives their shortcomings and gives them rich rewards for their good deeds.<br>
<br>13In this verse, Allah has comforted and urged His Messenger to propagate 
the Message without the least hesitation and not to waver in his determination 
for fear of ridicule or for lack of response from his people. He should convey 
the Message in its entirety and leave the result to Allah for He has full power 
over everything. In order to grasp its full significance, we should keep in view 
the circumstances that necessitated it.<br><br>At the tune of this Revelation, 
the Quraish were the most powerful and influential of all the clans. As they 
were the guardians of the Ka'abah (Makkah), the religious center of the Arabs, 
they enjoyed religious, economic, and political superiority over the whole of 
Arabia. Thus it was quite natural that they should resent and oppose that 
Message which proclaimed, "The religion of which you arc the leaders is 
absolutely false, and the system of life you are following is rotten to the 
core. As you are rejecting the Message, torment of Allah is threatening you. The 
only way of escape from it is that you should accept the Right Way and the 
righteous system of life I have brought from Allah." Obviously this Message 
struck a hard blow at their "superiority" and therefore they were averse to it 
from the very beginning.<br><br>The second reason why they did not accept it was 
that the Messenger possessed nothing extraordinary to convince the people of his 
Prophethood except his pure character and his rational, and understandable 
Message. Then for the Quraish, there was nothing to warrant a torment from Allah 
except the rotten condition of their religion, morality and culture. On the 
contrary, there was "prosperity" to delude them that that was a sure sign of the 
favors of Allah and of their "gods" and "goddesses", which was a clear proof 
that the ways they were following were the "right" ways. The inevitable result 
was that only a small minority of those people, who had sound minds and hearts, 
accepted the Message and the remaining large majority became hostile to it. Then 
some of them tried to suppress the Message by persecutions and some did their 
worst to defame it by false accusations and frivolous objections and others 
resorted to calculated indifference to discourage it. There were still others 
who adopted an attitude of ridicule, derision, taunt and mockery in order to 
make light of it.<br><br>The above condition went on for many years and was 
liable to fill one with despair and discouragement. Therefore the Sovereign 
reassured His Messenger, as if to say, "We disapprove of these shallow, 
superficial and mean people, who are trying to make your mission a failure by 
their prejudice, indifference, ridicule, mockery and frivolous objections. You 
should go on following the Right Way with perseverance and courage: you should 
go on proclaiming the Truth that has been revealed to you without the least 
hesitation: you should never be afraid of propagating the Message for fear of 
ridicule or indifference: you should go on inculcating the Truth in its entirety 
whether anyone accepts it or rejects it for it is Allah Who has everything in 
His power and charge and He alone affords guidance to everyone He considers fit 
for it."<br><br>14Here one and the same argument has been advanced to prove two 
things. First, the Qur'an has been revealed by Allah. Secondly, it proves the 
truth of the doctrine of Tauhid. The argument is this:<br><br>(1) "You say that 
the Qur'an has not been revealed by Allah but has been devised and invented by 
my self and ascribed to Him. If your claim had been genuine you would have been 
able to invent a book like this in answer to the challenge I have given you over 
and over again. As you have failed to do so even with your combined resources 
and forces, my claim that it has been revealed with Allah's knowledge has been 
proved absolutely, fully and completely."<br><br>(2) "Then there was a two-fold 
challenge from the Qur'an to your deities but they utterly failed to meet it. 
They were challenged to come to your aid and help produce a book like the 
Qur'an. As they have not helped you, it is a clear proof that they are 
absolutely powerless and have no share at all in Godhead. You have seen that 
they have not only failed in this decisive test, but have also proved to be 
impotent to defend themselves against the open attacks made on them in this 
Book, which asks the people not to worship them for they have no share in the 
powers of Godhead. These things have proved that there is nothing Divine in them 
and you have made them your deities without rhyme or reason".<br><br>
Incidentally, this verse shows that chronologically this Surah was revealed 
earlier than Surah Yunus. For at first they were challenged in this Surah to 
bring ten Surahs like the Surahs of the Qur'an, but they failed to do so. Then 
in Surah Yunus they were challenged (v. 38) to bring even one Surah like this. 
(X: 38 and E.N. 46).<br><br>15This general statement has been made in 
continuation of the theme of the preceding verses, to refute the false excuses 
of the disbelievers mentioned therein for rejecting the Message of the Qur'an. 
This verse says that in general those people who rejected the Qur'an then (and 
are rejecting it now) were the worshipers of this world and its pleasures. As 
the root cause of their rejection was (and is) this false creed that there is 
nothing more valuable than the pleasures of this world and its material gains, 
there should be no restrictions (like the ones imposed in the Qur'an) on their 
acquisition. They first made this choice, and afterwards invented arguments 
(like the ones mentioned in the Qur'an) to deceive their own minds and those of 
others. <br><br>16This is a clear and stern warning to the worshipers of the 
world. They should know that they will get the full reward for the exertions 
(whatever they be) they put forth in order to acquire the worldly gains but they 
should note it well that they would get nothing in the Next World. As they 
confined their efforts to the benefits of this world, and did nothing to earn 
the benefits of the Next World, they should expect nothing for the deeds they 
have done for the material gains of this world. In order to illustrate this, let 
us take the case of a person who desires to build a palace for himself in this 
world and adopts all those devices, measures and means which help build such a 
palace. Most surely, he will succeed in building a grand palace, for no brick 
will refuse to stick to its place simply because he was an unbeliever. But it is 
equally obvious that he shall have to leave behind in this world that grand 
palace along with all its furnishings as soon as he breathes his last breath. 
For there is no reason why the palace he had built (or done anything else) for 
this world, should be credited to him in the Next World, if he had done nothing 
to provide himself with a palace in the Next World. For only those who provide 
for themselves with the necessary material for a palace in the Next World in 
accordance with the Divine Law, deserve to get a palace there.<br><br>Now a 
question arises in regard to the logical conclusion of this argument, according 
to which he should not get a palace in the Next World. It is this: "Well, he may 
not get a palace, but why should he be thrown into the Fire of Hell? The answer 
is this (and the Qur'an itself has given this same answer in different places) 
that the one who exerts and works only for a palace in this world in utter 
disregard of the Hereafter, naturally and inevitably adopts such treasures and 
means as help build a large Fire for himself in the Hell. (Please refer to E.N. 
12 of Yunus.)<br><br>17This shows that even apart from revelation, there is 
ample evidence in man's own self, in the structure of the heavens and the earth, 
and in the order that prevails in the universe to prove that God is the only 
creator, master, lord and sovereign of the universe. The evidence referred to 
above also inclines man to believe that the present life will be followed by 
another one in which man will be required to render an account of his deeds and 
wherein he might be requited.<br><br>18The 'witness from Him' is the Qur'an. The 
testimony of the natural phenomena combined with that provided by man's own self 
had already created in man the disposition to affirm the truths mentioned 
earlier. All that was further reinforced by the Qur'an which came as reassurance 
that what he was predisposed to believe in was indeed true.<br><br>19In the 
present context the verse means that those who are overly infatuated with the 
allurements of a worldly life will be inclined to reject the message of the 
Qur'an. Distinguishable from these are those who take full note of the testimony 
furnished by their own beings and by the structure and order prevailing in the 
universe in support of God's unity. This testimony was further reinforced by the 
heavenly books revealed before the Qur'an. How could such persons close their 
eyes to such overwhelming testimony as this and join their voice with those of 
the unbelievers?<br><br>This verse clearly indicates that even before the Qur'an 
was revealed, the Prophet (peace be on him) had reached the stage of belief in 
the Unseen. We have seen in al-An'am (see 6: 75 ff.) the case of Abraham. Before 
being appointed a Prophet, Abraham (peace be on him) was led by a careful 
observation of the natural phenomena to knowledge of God's unity. Likewise, the 
present verse makes it clear that by his reflection, the Prophet (peace be on 
him), had been led to believe in the Unseen even before the Qur'an was revealed. 
Subsequently, when the Qur'an was revealed it not only confirmed what he had 
already become inclined to accept, but also provided definite knowledge about 
it.<br><br>20To invent a lie against God consists of stating that beings other 
than God also have a share with God in His godhead, that like God they are also 
entitled to be served and worshiped by God's creatures. Inventing a lie against 
God also consists of stating that God is not concerned with providing guidance 
to His creatures, that He did not raise Prophets for that purpose, and that He 
rather left men free to behave as they pleased. Inventing a lie against God also 
consists of stating that God created human beings by way of jest and sport and 
that He will not have them render an account to Him, and that He will not 
requite them for their deeds.<br><br>21Such a proclamation would be made on the 
Day of Judgment.<br><br>22This is a parenthetical statement. That is, that God's 
curse will be proclaimed in the Hereafter against those who are guilty of the 
crimes mentioned.<br><br>23Such persons do not like the Straight Way being 
expounded to them. They would rather have the Straight Way rendered crooked by 
altering it under the influence of lust, prejudice, fancy, and superstition. It 
is only after the way that was once straight has been rendered crooked that they 
will be willing to accept it.<br><br>24This, again, refers to what will happen 
in the Next Life.<br><br>25They will suffer punishment for being in error and 
for misleading others and leaving behind a legacy of error and misguidance for 
coming generations. (Al-A'raf, note 30}<br><br>26All their conjectures regarding 
God, the universe and their own selves will prove to be absolutely baseless in 
the Next Life. Similarly, the notions they entertained about the help and 
support they would receive from those they considered to be either their 
deities, or their intercessors with God, or their patrons will prove to be 
false. Likewise, it will become obvious that all their notions about the 
After-life were utterly untrue.<br><br>27This concludes the account about the 
Hereafter.<br><br>28Can the attitude and ultimate end of both these types of 
people be the same? Obviously, he who fails to see the right way and ignores the 
instruction of the guide who directs him to the right way will necessarily 
stumble and meet with some terrible mishap. However, he who perceives the right 
way and follows the instructions of his guide will reach his destination, and 
reach it safely.<br><br>The same difference is found between the two parties 
mentioned here. One of these carefully observes the realities of the universe 
and pays heed to the teachings of God's Messengers. The other party, however, 
neither uses their eyes properly to perceive God's signs, nor pays heed to His 
Messengers. The behavior of the two parties is, therefore, bound to be 
different. And when their behavior is different, there is no reason to believe 
that their ultimate end will be identical.<br><br>29E.N.'s 47-50 of Al-A'araf 
should be kept in view. <br><br>30This is the same thing that has been put into 
the mouth of Muhammad (God's peace be upon him) in vv. 2-3.<br><br>31The same 
foolish objection was being raised by the people against the Holy Prophet. They 
argued like this: "You are a man like you eat and drink, walk and sleep and have 
a family like us, and there i in you that might show that you have been sent by 
God. " (See E. N . XXXVI). <br><br>32The "big" people of Makkah passed the same 
remarks about those who followed the Holy Prophet. They taunted him with things 
like these: "Your followers consist of mere inexperienced boys or slaves or the 
lowest strata of society, in short, of such people as are credulous and lack 
commonsense and wisdom." {Please refer to E.N.'s 34-37 of Al-An`am and E.N. 75 
of Yunus). <br><br>33This is to say, "You claim that you are the favored ones of 
God Whose blessings are on you, and that those who do not follow your way are 
under His wrath. But the reverse of this is true for it is we who have been 
favored with wealth, servants and power and you possess nothing of the sort. 
Please point out anything in which you are superior to us." <br><br>34This is 
the same thing that has been put into the mouth of the Holy Prophet in v. 17. 
That is, "At first I recognized the reality of Tauhid by observing keenly the 
Signs of God in the universe, and in my own self. Then the same was confirmed by 
Revelation to me" . This shows that all the Prophets acquired the knowledge of 
the "Unseen" by observation and contemplation. Then Allah blessed them with the 
actual knowledge of the same at the time of their appointment as Prophets.<br>
<br>35This was to bring home to them the fact that he had no selfish motive in 
the performance of his mission, as if to say, "I am conveying the admonition to 
you without any demand or hope or expectation of worldly gains. Nay, I am 
bearing all the sufferings in the hope that you may at last realize that I have 
no ax to grind. And you cannot point out anything to show that I have any 
personal or selfish interest before me in the mission of the Message". (See. 
E.N. 70 of XXIII, E.N. 17 of XXXVI and E.N. 41 of XLII). <br><br>36That is, 
"Their true worth will be known only when they shall meet their Lord. Therefore 
it is not proper for you to treat them with contempt here in this world. Maybe 
they are precious stones-their Lord alone knows-and you are treating them as 
mere worthless stones". (See VI: 52, XVIII: 28).<br><br>37This is the answer to 
their objection that he was no more than a man like themselves. Prophet Noah 
admitted this: "In fact I am a man and I never claimed to be more than this. My 
only claim is that God has shown me the Right Way of knowledge and action and 
you are welcome to test this in any way you like. But instead of this, you are 
asking me questions about the "Unseen", though I never claimed to have its 
knowledge. You ask me to produce such things as can be produced only by that 
person who possesses God's treasures and I never claimed to possess them. You 
object that my physical life is like that of other men, though I never claimed 
that I was an angel and not a man. The true test of my claim is that you should 
ask me about the true creeds, the principles of morality and culture and not 
about frivolous things about the future events for I never claimed to possess 
their knowledge."<br><br>38That is, "All my efforts to do good to you cannot 
prove effective, if Allah has decided to withhold the right way from you because 
of your obduracy in evil and the lack of interest in good ways. For Allah lets 
people go astray on the way they choose for themselves."<br><br>39The wording of 
the verse shows that during the recital of the story of Prophet Noah, the 
opponents of the Holy Prophet might have felt that he himself had invented that 
story in order to hit them hard indirectly. So they might have interrupted him, 
saying, "You are inventing such stories as these in order to apply these to us 
and hit us hard indirectly." That is why the narration of the story has been 
broken to answer their false accusation.<br><br>And the fact is that the mean 
people always behave like this: As they have no interest in goodness, they would 
turn to the dark side of everything. Even if one gives them wise counsel or 
teaches them a useful lesson or warns them of an error, they would never benefit 
from these nor mend their ways. Instead of this, they would search out for that 
aspect of the matter which will not only undo the wisdom and goodness of the 
counsel but also bring an accusation against the admonisher. It is obvious that 
in this way, even the best of counsels can be made ' void and ineffective, if 
the hearer dubs that as a "hit," and takes it ill as an affront. Moreover, their 
thinking is always based on suspicion and mistrust. Supposing there is a certain 
story which appears to be true. A wise man will take it as a fact and learn a 
lesson from it, even if it applies exactly to his own condition and points out 
his error. On the contrary, a suspicious and crooked man will at once jump to 
the conclusion without any proof at all that the story had been invented for the 
sole purpose of applying it to him in order to hit him hard.<br><br>The same was 
the condition of those who accused the Holy Prophet that he himself had forged 
the story and ascribed it to Allah to make it more effective. Allah has asked 
him to say to them, "If I have forged the story, I shall have to bear its 
consequences, but this cannot lessen the punishments of the crimes you are 
committing for which you alone will be held responsible. "<br><br>40This verse 
lays down the limits of the Divine Law of respite. When the Message of a Prophet 
has been conveyed to a people and is rejected, they are granted respite from 
punishment only as long as there is the possibility that some of them might 
accept it. But when there remains no such possibility and there is left nothing 
but evil element among them, Allah does not grant them any further respite. And 
this is a manifestation of His mercy, just as for the safety of the good fruit 
the rotten ones should be thrown away and discarded. Conversely, it shall be an 
act of cruelty to the good people and the future generations, if pity is shown 
to those wicked people who are incorrigible.<br><br>41This is a very appropriate 
example of the points of view of those who look merely at the surface of things 
and of others who know the reality about them. It appears that when Prophet Noah 
was building the Ark on the land, it looked to be a ridiculous act to those 
wicked people who did not believe in him. They jeered at him as if to say, "Just 
see the madness of the old man! He wishes to float a ship on the land!" For they 
could never imagine that after a few days, a ship would actually float there. 
Therefore naturally they regarded that act of Prophet Noah to be a clear proof 
of his madness. Probably they might be pointing them fingers at him and the Ark 
he was constructing, saying to one another, "Have you any doubt now, if you had 
any before, that he is really a mad man, who is constructing a ship to float on 
the waterless land?" But the one, who had the knowledge of the reality and who 
knew that a ship would actually be needed there in the near future, was laughing 
at their ignorance and lack of knowledge of the real matter and their arrogant 
self-satisfaction, as if to say, "How foolish these people are! The catastrophe 
is threatening them overhead but they are not only self-satisfied but also 
regard me mad, who has warned them of it and who is himself making preparations 
to meet it." And these are exactly the two ways, in general, of judging the 
wisdom or folly of things. One man judges an act to be wise by looking merely at 
the surface, while the other goes down deep into it and knows it to be foolish. 
Likewise the former considers an act to be foolish and mad while the latter who 
has the real knowledge of the matter, knows that it is based on wisdom and 
foresight, and is the very same thing that was required undo the circumstances.<br>
<br>42Different interpretations have been given of this, but we are of the 
opinion that the correct one is the one that is based on the plain words of the 
Text. The Deluge started from At-Tannur, a particular oven from under which 
water began to boil up. At the same time heavy rain began to fall and springs 
began to gush up water from many places in the earth. This is given in detail in 
vv. 11-12 of Surah AI-Qamar: "We opened the gates of the sky from which it began 
to rain heavily and constantly, and We tore open the earth and springs began to 
gush forth water from every side: Thus the two kinds of water gathered together 
to fulfill the destined doom."<br><br>In this connection, it should also be 
noted that the prefix (al) (the) before (tannur), oven, shows that a particular 
oven had been specifically marked by God for the purpose of starting the Deluge. 
This began to boil up water as soon as it was commanded to do so, and afterwards 
it began to be called (The Oven). It has been explicitly stated in v. 7 of XXIII 
that the said Tannur was specified before hand. <br><br>43That is, "Don't embark 
in the Ark those who had specifically been marked as unbelievers from your 
household, for they do not deserve to be shown Our Compassion. Most probably 
they were two persons. One was his son who was drowned (v. 43), and the other 
was his wife: (LXVI: 10). And if there were any others, they have not been 
mentioned in the Qur'an. <br><br>44Incidentally, this refutes the theory of the 
historians and genealogists who trace the genealogy of the whole human race to 
the three sons of Prophet Noah. This wrong theory became prevalent because of 
the stories in the Bible that none other than Prophet Noah, his three sons and 
his wife were rescued from the deluge. (Genesis 6: 18, 7: 7, 9, and 9: 19). But 
the Qur'an contradicts this in many places, saying that besides the people of 
his own household, sane other people of his community, though small in number, 
were also rescued along with him. Moreover, the Qur'an declares that the 
generations which came after Prophet Noah were his descendants and of all those 
people who were rescued in the Ark: "You are the descendants of those whom We 
bore in the Ark with Noah-- (XVII: 3 ) " . . . . they were from the descendants 
of Adam, and from the seed of those whom we carried in the Ark with Noah...." 
(XIX: 58). <br><br>45This humility shown by Prophet Noah that his delivery from 
the Deluge was not due to his own plans, measures and efforts but to the Mercy 
and Compassion of his Lord, who is most Forgiving, is the true characteristic of 
a Believer The Servant of God adopts all necessary measures as a man of the 
world does, but he does not put his trust in those measures alone. Along with 
these he puts his trust in his Lord for their success, because he knows well 
that no measure can be adopted without His sanction, nor can it be put into 
practice nor can it achieve the required object unless it is helped by the 
Compassion and Favor of Allah.<br><br>46According to the Qur'an, the Ark rested 
upon Mount Judi, which is situated to the North-east of Jazirah Ibn 'Umar in 
Kurdistan. But according to the Bible its resting place was Mount Ararat in 
Armenia, which is one of the ranges of mountains of tire same name that extends 
from Armenia to southern Kurdistan. Mount Judi is one of the mountains of the 
Ararat range, and is known by the same name even today. The ancient histories 
confirm that the resting place of the Ark was Mount Judi. For instance, Berasus, 
a religious leader of Babylonia, who lived about 250 years before Christ, says 
in his history of the Chaldeans that Noah's Ark rested upon Mount Judi. 
Abydenus, a pupil of Aristotle, not only confirms the same but also says that 
many people of `Iraq of his time possessed pieces of the Ark, which they ground 
in water and gave to the sick as a medicine.<br><br>Now let us consider the 
question: Did the Deluge mentioned here cover the whole earth or was it confined 
to that particular region where Prophet Noah lived? This is a question which has 
not been finally settled up to this day. As far as the Bible and the Israelite 
traditions are concerned, this was universal. (Genesis 7: 18-24). But the Qur'an 
is silent about it, though it does say things which show that the whole human 
race after the Deluge was the descendant of Prophet Noah and of those with him 
in the Ark, but this does not mean that the Deluge covered all the earth. It may 
be explained like this: at that time of the history the only region of the 
earth, which was inhabited by the human race, was the region in which Noah 
lived, and the generations which came after the Deluge, gradually spread over 
other parts of the earth. This theory is supported by two things. First, there 
is a conclusive proof that a great flood did come over the land of the Tigris 
and the Euphrates. This is confirmed by historical traditions, archaeological 
remains and geological evidence. But there are no such proofs in the other parts 
of the earth as might show that the Deluge was universal. Secondly, traditions 
have come down to almost all the peoples of the earth living even in distant 
places like America and Australia, that once a great flood had come all over the 
earth. The only conclusion which can be drawn from the above is that at one time 
the forefathers of all the people of the earth lived at one place. But, when 
afterwards they spread over different lands in the earth; they carried the 
traditions of the Deluge along with them. (Please refer to E.N. 47 of 
Al-A'araf).<br><br>47That is, "Thou promised that Thou wilt save the members of 
my family from this calamity; so save my son for he is also a member of my 
family." <br><br>48That is, "Thou art the greatest of all rulers: therefore Thy 
decision is final and there can be no appeal against it." And "Thou art the best 
of all rulers: therefore all Thy decisions are based on perfect knowledge and 
absolute justice." <br><br>49Allah has called the wicked son of Prophet Noah "a 
worthless act", for children are entrusted by the Creator to the care of parents 
so that they may bring them up and train them to become "good persons" and 
fulfill the purpose for which He created man. If a father does his very best to 
"process" and turn the child into a righteous person, but fails in his efforts, 
the child, who was a sort of raw material in his hands, would be likened to a 
"worthless act". It is obvious that the wicked son was a "worthless act", for he 
was not the sort of "good work" which his father had desired him to be. So in 
this sense he did not belong to the family of Prophet Noah, whom the Creator had 
sent to mold all his people into "Good acts", especially those who were of his 
own flesh and blood. Thus that unrighteous son had forfeited all the rights of 
blood he had with the Prophet as far as the torment of "the Deluge" was 
concerned.<br><br>Now let us consider the other question: Why was not the 
request of the Prophet regarding his own flesh and blood granted? The answer is 
this: If any part of the body of a man becomes so rotten that the surgeon is of 
the definite opinion that that part must be cut off for the sake of the safety 
of the rest of the body, the surgeon will not comply with the request of the man 
not to cut that part of his body, but will say, "It is not a part of your body 
because it is rotten." This will not, however, mean that it was never actually a 
part of the body but will imply only this: "As it has ceased to function tightly 
as a part of the body, it is no more a part of the body in the sense and for the 
purpose the healthy parts of the body ace its parts" .Likewise, when it was said 
to Prophet Noah, "He is not of your family," it did not negate the fact that he 
was from his loins but implied, "He does not deserve to be treated as a member 
of your righteous family because of his spoiled morals and conduct. As the 
torment of the Deluge has been brought about to punish those who had sided with 
the unbelievers in the conflict of kufr and Faith, your son does not deserve to 
be rescued from it along with the believers. Had it been a conflict between your 
descendants and those of the unbelievers, the result would have been different, 
but this being a conflict between the righteous and the unrighteous, the former 
alone will be delivered from it."<br><br>The epithet, "a worthless act", has 
been purposely applied to the son of Noah, for it is very meaningful. It points 
to the two different objects that the parents have in view in bringing up their 
children. Those parents who look merely at the surface of things, bring up and 
love their children because they are from their loins or their wombs, 
irrespective of the fact whether they are righteous or unrighteous. But this 
epithet requires the believers to look upon their children as "pieces of work" 
entrusted to them in a natural way by their Creator, so that they should prepare 
and mold them so as to fulfill the object for which Allah has created man. 
Therefore, if a certain parent fails in his efforts to mold his child in a way 
to fulfill the very object for which the child was entrusted to him and the 
latter becomes a servant of Satan instead of his Lord, the parent should regard 
all his efforts for the child to have gone utterly waste. In that case there is 
no reason why that parent should have any consideration for that "worthless 
act".<br><br>As a corollary to the above, the same rule will apply to the other 
relationships of a believer. As a believer is one who believes in certain creeds 
and behaviors, all his relationships with the other people will be determined by 
those creeds and behaviors. If his blood relations have the qualities of a 
believer, their relationship with him becomes doubly stronger. But if they are 
void of the qualities of a believer; the believer will confine his relationship 
with them only to the extent of blood relationships and will have no spiritual 
relationship with them. Consequently, if such a relative comes face to face with 
the believer in the conflict between kufr and the Faith, the believer should 
fight with him just as he would with any other unbeliever.<br><br>50This warning 
from his Lord does not mean that Prophet Noah was suffering from the lack of 
"Faith" or that his Faith had any tinge of weakness or that he had beliefs like 
those of the ignorant people. His response to this is rather a proof of his high 
moral character. As Noah was like the other Prophets, a human being, he also 
suffered from the common human weakness, that is, natural parental love for 
children. So he begged his Lord to deliver his son from the Deluge. Allah 
admonished him because the high character of a Prophet demanded that he ought 
not to have made such a request even for his own flesh and blood. That is why no 
sooner was the warning administered w him than he realized that he had come down 
from the high position of a Prophet to the level of a mere father because of the 
critical psychological human weakness. Therefore immediately after the warning, 
he repented of his weakness, and behaved as if his own son had not been drowned 
in the Deluge a moment before this. This character shown by him is a clear proof 
that he was a true Prophet. He returned to the same height and meekly asked his 
Lord's forgiveness for showing any concern for his own son who had forsaken the 
Truth and sided with falsehood. <br><br>51The Qur'an has cited the story of the 
drowning of the son of Prophet Noah to bring home to the people that Allah's 
decrees are absolutely just and final.<br><br>This also served as a warning to 
the Quraish who considered themselves to be immune from the torment of Allah 
simply because they were the descendants of Prophet Abraham, and had several 
gods and goddesses as their interceders. Likewise it was a warning to the Jews 
and the Christians who cherished, and still cherish, such beliefs, nay, even to 
those Muslims, who foolishly believe that their saintly ancestors and holy 
people will guard them against the consequences of the justice of Allah. For the 
tragic scene depicted here categorically refutes such false expectations and 
beliefs, saying, "O foolish people ! Why do you cherish such false hopes? When 
Our Prophet Noah could not save his son who was drowned before his very eyes, 
and his prayer for the son was not only rejected but he was rebuked for making 
such a prayer, how can you then expect that anyone much less than a Prophet can 
deliver you from the justice of Allah?"<br><br>52That is, go down from the 
Mountain on which the Ark is resting.<br><br>53That is, "You and your companions 
will come out successful at the end of the conflict just as Prophet Noah and his 
companions did. For this is the Divine Law that those who exert for the right 
cause, avoiding erroneous ways for fear of Allah, should come out successful in 
the end, even though they should meet with failures in the beginning of the 
conflict at the hands of the enemies of the truth. Therefore you should 
patiently bear the afflictions which you are suffering and stand steadfast 
against the obstacles you are encountering in the way, and you should not be in 
the least disheartened by the painful and superficial successes of your enemies. 
If you practice fortitude, you will come out successful in the end like Noah and 
his companions.<br><br>54Please keep in view E.N.'s 51-56 of Al-A'araf.<br><br>
55That is, "You have forged falsehood about all the deities you worship beside 
Allah, for in fact they possess no powers and no qualities that might entitle 
them to Godhead. As they have absolutely nothing in them which might make them 
the objects of worship and service, you have put in them false hopes that they 
would fulfill your desires and needs."<br><br>56This concise sentence contains a 
very strong argument: "The fact that you are taking a superficial view of my 
Message and rejecting it without paying due and deep consideration to it is a 
clear proof that you are not using your common-sense. Had you tried to 
understand the matter, you would have found much material for your 
consideration. You would have noticed that I have absolutely no personal 
interests: nay, I am suffering hardships, in conveying the Message which cannot 
bring any benefit to me or to the members of my family. This is a conclusive 
proof that my Faith has very sound bases which are strong enough to enable me to 
forsake all the worldly joys and comforts and encounter the enmity of the whole 
world by waging a war against the centuries-old, established rites, customs and 
ways of life. Do these things not demand a deep and serious consideration? Why 
don't you then use your common-sense before rejecting the Message out-right?"<br>
<br>57It is the same thing that has been put into the mouth of the Holy Prophet 
in v. 3. This is a clear proof that moral values count not only in the life of 
the Hereafter but also determine the rise and fall of nations in this world. 
This is because Allah rules over the world in accordance with moral principles 
and not on the basis of His physical laws alone. That is why Allah has declared 
in many places in the Qur'an that the fate of a community hangs on the Message 
which He sends to it through His Prophet. If it accepts the Message, He opens 
the gates of His favors and blessings for it, but if it rejects the Message, 
then it is destroyed.<br><br>In short, this verse is an article of the moral Law 
in accordance with which Allah deals with man. Conversely, the other article of 
the same principle of the Law is that the community which, deluded by its 
worldly prosperity, begins to tread the paths of sin and iniquity is ultimately 
destroyed. But if, during its headlong race towards its doom, it realizes its 
erroneous behavior and gives up its disobedience and turns in repentance towards 
Allah, its evil fate is changed and the impending scourge is averted and it is 
given a further term of respite along with blessings and favors.<br><br>58That 
is, "You have not brought a clear Sign as evidence to prove conclusively to us 
that you have been sent by Allah and that the Message you are presenting before 
us is the Truth."<br><br>59That is, "It appears that you had behaved rudely 
towards a god or goddess or saint: Consequently you have been smitten with 
madness and are being abused, dishonored and pelted with stones in the same 
streets in which you were respected and honored before this." <br><br>60This was 
the refutation of their charge that he had not brought any clear evidence to 
them. It implied: "You say that I have brought no evidence to prove that I have 
been sent by Allah who is a standing witness everywhere in His universe and 
giving evidence with the phenomena of Nature to show that the truths I have 
stated before you are absolutely correct. These also prove conclusively that 
there is no sign of truth in what you falsely ascribe to your gods."<br><br>
61This is the answer of Prophet Hud to their assertion, "We are not going to 
give up our gods at your word....." (V: 53). His reply implied, "Note it well 
that I, too, feel a strong disgust at the gods you have set up beside Allah."<br>
<br>62This is his answer to their threat: ".......some of our gods have smitten 
you with some evil ........" (compare this with X: 71).<br><br>63That is, 
"Whatever my Lord does is always right and correct for all His ways are straight 
and just, and the judgments He passes are based entirely on truth and justice. 
Therefore you cannot come out successful in your conflict with me: for you have 
deviated from the Right Way and are committing wicked deeds, while I am on the 
Right Way." <br><br>64This is his answer to their obdurate denial: "...... nor 
will we believe in you...."<br><br>65Though only one Messenger had come to them, 
he had presented the same Message that had been presented by every Messenger in 
every age to every community. Therefore disobedience to one Messenger has been 
declared to be disobedience to all the Messengers.<br><br>66Please keep in view 
E.N.'s 57-62 of Al-A'Aaraf. <br><br>67This is the proof of the claim: " .... you 
have no other Deity than Allah" .The argument is based on the fact which the 
mushriks themselves acknowledged that it is Allah Who is their Creator. 
Therefore Prophet Salih argued like this: "You yourselves acknowledge that it is 
Allah Who has created your wonderful human body out of the life-less particles 
of the earth and that it is Allah Who has made the earth a suitable place for 
you to live. How can then there be any Deity other than Allah Who may be worthy 
of Godhead, service and worship?"<br><br>68That is, "So ask His forgiveness for 
the sin you have been committing by worshiping others."<br><br>69In this concise 
sentence, the Qur'an has refuted a grave misunderstanding of the mushriks, which 
has in every age misled people into wrong creeds. They presumed that Allah lived 
far away from them and, therefore, was unapproachable like their own rulers on 
the earth. As the only way of approach to them was an intercessor who alone 
could receive and present their requests and applications to their rulers, and 
convey their answers to them, they presumed that there should be some 
intercessor to help approach Allah and bring to them the answers to their 
prayers. Obviously this is a false presumption, which has been endorsed and 
encouraged by clever people that Allah is out of the reach of common people and 
it is not possible for them to reach Him and present their prayers and get their 
answers. So they should search for such sacred beings as may have an approach to 
Him. Accordingly, they tried to secure the services of those who were 
well-versed in the art of conveying the requests with the necessary presents and 
gifts to the Highest Authority. This misunderstanding created hosts of 
intercessors, and the establishment of the system of priesthood, which has so 
incapacitated the followers of mushrik creeds of ignorance that they cannot 
perform by themselves any religious ceremony from birth to death.<br><br>Now let 
us consider the concise answer of Prophet Salih, by which he broke asunder the 
false presumption of the mushriks. It is this: "Allah is near at hand: so you 
can invoke His help directly without the help of any interceder. He answers 
prayers: so you can yourselves receive the answer to your prayer. Though He is 
the Highest, each one of you will find Him so near yourself that you will be 
able to convey your request even in a whisper, nay, you are permitted to convey 
your requests openly or secretly to Him. Therefore give up the folly of seeking 
interceders and setting them up as His partners, and address your prayers to Him 
Who is near at hand and answers prayers." (Please refer also to E.N. 188 of 
Al-Baqarah. )<br><br>70That is, "We had expected that by your wisdom, 
intelligence, foresight, serious behavior and dignified personality, you would 
become a great and prosperous man. So we had looked forward to the great success 
you would achieve and to the manifold advantages we would gain over other clans 
and tribes because of you. But you have brought to naught all of our hopes by 
adopting the Way based on Tauhid and the Hereafter which is bound to lead us to 
utter ruin."<br><br>It may be noted here that the people of Muhammad (Allah's 
peace be upon him) have had the same great expectations of him. They, too, had a 
very high opinion of his abilities and capabilities before his appointment as a 
Prophet. For they expected that he would become a great leader, and his 
foresight would bring innumerable benefits to them also. But when, contrary to 
their expectations, he began to invite them to the doctrines of Tauhid and the 
Hereafter, and preach the principles of high morality, they lost not only all 
hope in him, but began to entertain and express quite the reverse views. They 
said, "What a pity! this man who was quite good till now has, under the 
influence of some charm, not only ruined his own career but has destroyed all of 
our hopes as well".<br><br>71That was their argument for the worship of their 
gods. They said that they would worship them because their forefathers worshiped 
them. Prophet Salih, argued like this: "Worship Allah....Who has created you 
from the earth, and Who made it a living place for you." In answer to this they 
argued, as if to say, "These deities are also worthy of worship, and we will not 
give them up, because our forefathers have been worshiping them for a long 
time." This is an apt example of the type of arguments employed by the 
supporters of Islam and "ignorance". The former base their arguments on sound 
reasoning, while the latter base them on blind imitation.<br><br>72The Qur'an 
has not specified the nature of the doubts and "feelings of distraction" . This 
is because, though all of them had these feelings, these were different in 
different persons. For it is one of the characteristics of the Message that it 
takes away the peace of mind of all these people to whom it is addressed. 
'Though the feelings of distraction are of various kinds, everyone gets a 
portion of them. This is because it becomes simply impossible for anyone to 
continue treading the paths of deviation with that peace of mind which one had 
before the coming of the Message. For it impels everyone to think whether one is 
following the Right Way or any of the wrong ways of "ignorance". No one can shut 
one's ears and eyes against the penetrating and merciless criticism of the 
weaknesses of the ways of "ignorance", and the strong and rational arguments for 
the Right Way. Then the high moral character of the Messenger, his perseverance, 
his nobility, his gentle conduct, his frank and righteous attitude and his 
dignity cannot fail to snake their impressions even on the most obdurate, and 
prejudiced opponents. The Message by itself attracts the best elements from that 
society and brings about the most revolutionary changes in the characters of its 
followers so as to make them models of excellence. Naturally all these things 
combine to produce the feelings of distraction in the minds of those who desire 
to uphold the ways of "ignorance" even after the coming of the Truth.<br><br>
73This is the answer to the preceding question: "If I disobey Allah by 
discarding the Guidance I have received from Him in order to please you, you 
cannot defend me against Him. You will rather add to the intensity of my guilt 
of disobedience to Him. Thus I shall incur additional punishment from Him for 
misleading you instead of showing the Right Way for which I had been sent to 
you.<br><br>74According to the traditions that are current in the Sinai 
Peninsula, Allah delivered them from the Torment and led them there. There is a 
Mount near Jabal-i-Musa, known by the name of Prophet Salih where, it is said, 
the Prophet took refuge after the destruction of his people.<br><br>75This shows 
that the angels had come to Prophet Abraham in the shape of human beings and had 
not disclosed their identity. Therefore he took them for strangers and brought a 
roasted calf for their entertainment. <br><br>76Some commentators are of the 
view that Prophet Abraham was afraid of them because, from their refusal to eat 
his meal, he had concluded that they had come to him with some evil intention. 
For, according to the Arab tradition, if some strangers refused hospitality, it 
meant that they had not come as guests but as enemies to plunder. But this view 
is not supported by the succeeding verse. <br><br>77The wording of their answer 
shows that Prophet Abraham had understood from their refusal to cat that they 
were angels. But he was afraid of their visit because he knew that the coming of 
the angels in the human shape did not bode well: So he was fearful that they 
might have come to take them to task for some offense committed by the people of 
his household or of his habitation or by himself. Had it been the same thing 
that the commentators presumed, then their answer should have been, "Don't fear 
us for we are angels from your Lord. " But the answer they gave to remove his 
fear, "Don't have any fear for we have been sent to the people of Lot (and not 
to you)," shows that Abraham knew that they were angels but was troubled in his 
mind as to the reason of their visit in the human shape. This was because the 
angels came in human shape when some one was either to be put to a hard trial or 
punished severely for some offense.<br><br>78It appears from this that the news 
of the visit of the angels in the human shape had made the people of the house 
uneasy. So Prophet Abraham's wife had also come there to know what the matter 
was. She laughed with joy when she learned that the angels were sent not to 
punish their people but the people of Lot.<br><br>79The angels told the good 
news of a son to Hadrat Sarah instead of Prophet Abraham because he already had 
a son, Hadrat Ismail ,from Hadrat Hajirah but had no child from her. Therefore 
to remove her sorrow they told her the good news that a son, Isaac, will be born 
to her, who will have a son, Jacob, both of whom will be great Messengers of 
Allah.<br><br>80These words were not used by her in their literal sense as an 
exclamation of grief and lamentation. She uttered these words merely to express 
surprise at the news.<br><br>81According to the Bible Prophet Abraham was 100 
years old at the time and Hadrat Sarah was 90 years. <br><br>82The question was 
posed to her to remind her, that, though people of old age, do not bear 
children, it is not beyond Allah's power to bring this about. Therefore a true 
believer like her should not show any surprise at. the good news, when it is 
conveyed to her from Allah.<br><br>83" .... he began to dispute with Us" is the 
expression of affection and endearment, which manifests the nature of close 
relationship of Prophet Abraham with his Lord. This helps depict the picture of 
the argument that the Servant had with his Lord for pleading the case of the 
people of Lot. He pleaded persistently, "Lord avert the coming scourge from the 
people of Lot". The Lord replied, "These people have become so degraded that no 
good was left in them and their crimes have become so heinous that they deserve 
no leniency at all." But the Servant still persisted, "Lord, give them more 
respite, even if a little good yet remains in them; maybe it should bear some 
fruit." This dispute' has been recorded in the Bible rather in detail, but the 
concise mention in the Qur'an is more meaningful. (For comparison please refer 
to Genesis 18: 23-32).<br><br>84A superficial view of this incident from the 
life of Prophet Abraham in the context it occurs might lead one to consider it 
to be irrelevant, especially as an introduction to the coming scourge on the 
people of Lot. But if one reviews this in the light of the object for which 
these historical events have been related here, one will come to the conclusion 
that its mention is most apt here. In order to understand its relevancy we 
should keep in view the following two things:<br><br>(1) These historical events 
have been related here to warn the Quraish that they were absolutely wrong in 
their self-delusion that they were quite immune from the scourge with which the 
Qur'an was threatening them because of their relationship with Prophet Abraham 
and their guardianship of the Ka`abah and their religious, economic and 
political leadership of Arabia. They thought that Prophet Abraham, whose 
descendants they were, was a beloved servant of Allah and, would, therefore, 
intercede for them and defend them against any scourge from Him. That is why the 
graphic picture of the death of Prophet Noah's son has been drawn to show that 
the prayer of a great Prophet like him could not save his own son from the 
scourge. Not only was his prayer rejected but he was also taken to task for 
making a request for his wicked son. Then this second incident from the life of 
Prophet Abraham has been related to show that, though Allah was very kind to 
him, He rejected his appeal for the people of Lot because he had tried to 
intercede for the wicked people, which was against the requirements of justice.<br>
<br>(2) This incident from the life of Prophet Abraham has been related along 
with , the destruction of the people of Lot for another object as well. The 
Quraish had forgotten that the Law of Divine Justice had always been operating 
continuously and regularly and there were open proofs of this all around them. 
On the one hand, there was the case of Prophet Abraham. He had to leave his home 
for the sake of the Truth and righteousness and to live in a foreign country 
where to all appearances, he had no outward power to support him. But Divine 
Justice rewarded him for his righteousness with a son like Isaac and a grandson 
like Jacob (Allah's peace be upon them) whose descendants, the Israelites, 
reigned supreme for centuries over the same Palestine where he had taken refuge 
as a stranger. On the other hand, there were the people of Lot who were living 
nearby in great prosperity, which had intoxicated them so much that they lived 
in open wickedness, totally forgetting that they would be overtaken by 
retribution from Allah. So much so that they scoffed at the admonition of 
Prophet Lot. But Divine Justice came into operation at the same time, when it 
was conveying the good news to Prophet Abraham and decreed that those wicked 
people should be annihilated from the face of the earth. As a result of this, no 
vestige of their habitations was left on the surface of the earth. This fact 
should serve as a lesson to the wicked people for all times.<br><br>85Please 
keep in view E.N.'s 63-68 of Al-A'araf. <br><br>86From the tenor of the details 
of the story as given in the different parts of the Qur'an, it becomes quite 
plain that the angels came to Prophet Lot in the shape of handsome boys and that 
he was unaware that they were angels. That is why he was troubled and distressed 
in his mind, for he knew how wicked and shameless were his people. <br><br>87By 
"my daughters" Prophet Lot might have meant either of the two things. He might 
have referred to the daughters of the community as "ray daughters" because the 
relationship of a Prophet to his people is as of a father to his children. But 
it is also possible that he aught have meant by this his own daughters. Anyhow 
this could not have been an offer of adultery, for the succeeding sentence 
"..these are purer for you" leaves no room for such a misunderstanding. This 
makes it quite obvious that Prophet Lot admonished them in this way so as to 
turn them to the females for the lawful gratification of their sexual desires 
instead of seeking unnatural ways.<br><br>88This answer of the people of Lot 
shows that they had gone to the lowest depth of depravity and openly and 
brazen-facedly declared that they did not want females but males. This was the 
proof that they had not only left the natural way of purity and strayed into the 
unnatural way of impurity but had also lost all interest in the natural way of 
gratification. Such a depraved condition is the worst form of moral degradation, 
for it shows that no good has been left at all. Supposing a person has fallen a 
victim to an unlawful and sinful behavior but at the same time considers it to 
be a wrong behavior which should be avoided. There is hope for the reform of 
such a person, and even if he does not mend his way the utmost that can be said 
about him is that 'he is a depraved person'. On the other hand, if a person 
gives himself wholly to the unlawful because he has no interest in the lawful, 
such a filthy person is not worthy of being considered a man at all, and 
therefore should be wiped out of the earth. That is why Allah decreed that the 
people of Lot should be completely annihilated from the face of the earth. <br>
<br>89This meant to impress on them the urgency of the matter so that they 
should get out of the doomed place and should not even turn round to look behind 
to see what was happening there. They were warned lest they should be attracted 
by the loud noises caused by the explosions and by the wailing of the people and 
thus lag behind in the territory that had been marked for the scourge and was to 
be overtaken by it. <br><br>90The doom of the wife of Prophet Lot is the third 
incident related in this Surah to serve as a lesson that no relationship can 
deliver a people from the horrible consequences of their sin. <br><br>91Probably 
the scourge came in the form of a horrible earthquake which turned their 
habitations upside down and the explosion of a volcano which rained stones on 
them.<br><br>"Stones of baked clay" probably refers to the stones that are 
formed by the underground heat and lava in the volcanic regions. The signs of 
such a formation are found even today near the Lot Sea. <br><br>92That is, 
"Every stone had been specified by Allah to do some particular work of 
destruction there, and to hit a particular offender".<br><br>93This was meant to 
warn the workers of iniquity who were engaged in their evil work, as if to say, 
"You should not consider yourselves immune from scourge as though it were far 
from you. If it could visit the people of Lot, it could overpower you as well. 
Neither the people of Lot were able to defend themselves against Allah, nor can 
you frustrate Him now. <br><br>94Please keep in view E.N.'s 69-76 of Al-A'araf.<br>
<br>95That is, "I have no power over you. The most I can do for you is to 
admonish you as a well-wisher, but it rests with you to accept my advice or 
reject it. As you are accountable to Allah and not to me for your deeds, 
therefore you should fear Him and desist from your mischievous deeds, if you 
sincerely believe in Him."<br><br>96This taunting question was an expression of 
the feelings of hatred those un-godly people cherished against the religious 
observances of Prophet Shu`aib and other God-fearing, pious people. They 
selected Salat as a target of their taunt because it is the first and foremost 
outwardly observance of true religion which naturally has always been strongly 
hated by all un-godly wicked people. This hatred may also be noticed today among 
those who deliberately intend to follow the wicked ways, for they consider 
religious observances to be the greatest threat to their evil ways. As they 
regard Salat to be a symbol of the corning trouble, they begin to taunt the one 
who observes it. For they know that the victim of the "disease" of religiosity 
will not rest content with his own reformation but will exert his utmost to 
reform others as well. They fear that he will preach piety and righteous ways to 
them and criticize their ungodly and immoral ways. That is why Salat becomes the 
target of the taunts of wicked people. And if the person who observes Salat 
actually begins to preach the observance of virtues and criticize their evil 
ways just as they had feared, then they condemn it even more vehemently as 
though it were the cause of the whole trouble. <br><br>97These two things 
clearly distinguish the theory of the way of "ignorance" from, the theory of the 
way of "Islam". The way of "ignorance" is based on the assumption that one 
should follow the way of one's forefathers: and for the mere reason that it has 
been inherited from one's forefathers. Its second assumption is that one's faith 
and religion are concerned only with worship, and these have nothing to do with 
the worldly affairs of life, in which one is absolutely free to do as one 
pleases. On the other hand, the basic theory of Islam is that every way that is 
not founded on the submission to Allah is wrong, and, therefore, should not be 
followed, for no other way has got any proof of its truth from reason, knowledge 
and revelation. Besides, Islam is not confined to the worship of Allah but it 
covers in its entirety all aspects of life-cultural, social, economic and 
political. This is because all that man possesses really belongs to Allah and, 
therefore, man has absolutely no right to do as he pleases with his possessions.<br>
<br>Incidentally, this demand of the people of Prophet Shua'ib that they had 
every right to do as they pleased with their goods and possessions shows that 
there is nothing new about the theory of the division of life into separate 
compartments, religious and mundane. Some three thousand years or so ago they 
insisted on this division just as Western and Westernized people insist on it 
today. And they are absolutely wrong to presume that their division is the 
result of the `light' that had dawned upon humanity because of the "intellectual 
progress" that man has made as a result of the evolutionary process. Thus it is 
clear that it is not light but darkness which prevailed with the same intensity 
thousands of years ago as it is today and that the conflict of Islam against it 
is also as old as that.<br><br>98Here (rizq) implies two things: provision of 
the knowledge of the Truth and provision of the necessities of life from Allah. 
In the first sense, it refers to the same thing that has been declared in this 
Surah by Prophets Muhammad, Noah and Salih (Allah's peace be upon them all), 
that is, "Allah bestowed on me by revelation that knowledge of the Truth, which 
I already had gained by making keen observations of my own self and of the 
phenomena of Nature. Therefore I cannot be a party to your evil creeds and 
unlawful practices." In the second sense, it is the answer to this taunt of 
theirs: "Indeed you are the only generous and righteous person left in the 
land!" It meant, so to say, this: "When my Lord has bestowed on me both the 
knowledge of the Truth and the good and lawful provisions of life, your taunts 
cannot turn this favor into disfavor. Therefore I cannot be so ungrateful to Him 
as to declare your deviations to be the truth and your unlawful practices 
lawful." <br><br>99That is, "It is a proof of the truth of my claim that I 
myself practice what I preach to you. For instance, if I had forbidden you to 
visit the shrines of gods and goddesses but had myself become the guardian of 
some such shrine, you would have been justified in bringing this charge against 
me that I was preaching the Doctrine of Tauhid merely for the sake of ruining 
the "business" of others in order to make room for my own trade. Likewise, if I 
had prohibited the use of unlawful means for you but had myself applied the same 
in my own trade, you would have been justified in charging me with preaching 
honesty merely for winning good reputation for the prosperity of my own trade; 
But you yourselves are a witness to this that I myself abstain from those evils 
which I forbid you to practice and I keep myself pure from those blemishes of 
which I desire to cleanse you and I follow the way to which I invite you. All 
this is a clear proof that I believe in the truth of the Message I am conveying 
to you." <br><br>100That is, "Your land is not far from the land of the people 
of Lot, which has been totally destroyed. It is quite near and what happened did 
not take place long ago."<br><br>101Prophet Shu`aib brought the attribute of 
love of Allah for His creation specially to the notice of his people in order to 
induce them to give up despair and turn to Allah for forgiveness for their evil 
deeds, so as to say, "Allah is not hard-hearted and cruel, and cherishes no 
feelings of enmity towards His creatures. He does not desire to punish thetas 
anyhow as if He were to derive pleasure from their torture. As a matter of fact, 
He inflicts punishment on you only when you transgress all limits and that, too, 
for the good of mankind. Therefore if you feel ashamed of your sins and repent 
of these, you will find Him Forbearing, for He loves His creation very much."<br>
<br>The Holy Prophet has explained the same thing by citing a parable. He said, 
"Suppose one of you was traveling in a waterless desert and lost his camel on 
whom he had laden all his provisions for-the journey. He made a thorough search 
for the missing camel, but in vain. Then, in despair of his life, he lay down 
tinder a tree. When, lo, the camel with all the provisions intact on it appeared 
all of a sudden before him. Just imagine his happiness. Allah is more pleased 
than that man, when a sinful servant returns to Him in penitence." There. is 
another incident even more effective than this related by Hadrat `Umar: "Once 
some prisoners of war were brought before the Holy Prophet. One of thetas was a 
mother whose infant child had been lost. This had made her so restless and 
uneasy that she would hold any child she came across close to her breasts and 
suckle it. When the Holy Prophet saw this; he put this question to the 
bystanders: 'Can you imagine that this mother would ever throw her own child 
into the fire?' We replied, 'Never'; not to speak of throwing it into the fire, 
she would do her utmost in every possible way to prevent it from falling into 
the fire' . " Then the Holy Prophet said. "Allah is much more merciful to His 
servants than this mother is to her child."<br><br>Let us consider the same 
thing from another point of view. It is Allah Who has created love in the hearts 
of the mother and the father for their child, and without this parental love, 
they would never have shown the care and the sacrifice they shower on their 
child; nay, they would have even become its enemies because of the trouble and 
inconvenience they have to bear for it. From this it is quite evident that the 
love of the Creator of this parental affection for His own Creation must be far 
greater than this parental love.<br><br>102They did not understand what Prophet 
Shu'aib said to them not because he talked to them in some foreign language or 
because the theme was too difficult or complicated for them, for he talked to 
them in their own language and his theme was simple and clear. As a matter of 
fact, they did not understand because they would not: Their crooked thinking 
left neither any desire nor any aptitude for understanding his talk. And this is 
true of all those people who become such slaves of their prejudices and lusts as 
render them incapable of accepting anything against their preconceived notions. 
For they are neither inclined to listen to such things nor understand them as 
though these things were not .or them nor were they for them. <br><br>103While 
studying this part of the story of Prophet Shu'aib, it should be kept in view 
that similar conditions were prevalent at Makkah at the time of the revelation 
of this story. The Quraish were as blood thirsty to kill the Holy Prophet as 
were the people of Madian to take the life of Prophet Shu`aib. Just as the 
people of Prophet Shu'aib desisted from this evil design because they were 
afraid of his family, likewise the Quraish were afraid of Bani Hashim and 
refrained from executing their evil designs. So this story was being related to 
warn the Quraish that they should learn a lesson from the answer of Prophet 
Shu`aib (vv. 92-93), as if to say, "O people of Quraish! This same is the answer 
to you from Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him)".<br><br>104From this verse and 
some other narrations of the Qur'an it appears that the leaders of a community 
in this world will be its leaders also on the Day of Resurrection. If they 
guided and led the people towards virtue, righteousness and truth in this world, 
their followers will gather together under their banner on the Day of 
Resurrection and march to the Garden under their leadership. On the other hand, 
if they called people to some deviation, immorality or unrighteous ways their 
followers will follow them there also, and march to the fire of Hell under their 
leadership. The Holy Prophet explained this thing in a Tradition: "On the Day of 
Resurrection, the banner of the poets of "ignorance" will be in the hands of 
Imra-ul-Quais, and all of them will march towards Hell under his leadership."<br>
<br>Now let us try to picture the march-past of these two processions. It is 
obvious that the first procession will march happily and joyously, praying for 
and praising their leaders whose guidance had led them to this happy state of 
marching to the blessed Paradise. On the other hand, when the followers of the 
leaders of errors will find themselves in the miserable plight, to which the 
leaders had brought them, naturally their anger against them will be beyond 
description. For the followers will march towards Hell, abusing and cursing 
their leaders, who had brought them to that horrible state of torture.<br><br>
105That is, "In these historical events there is a sign which will show 
conclusively to the one who considers this deeply that the torment of the 
Hereafter is inevitable, as warned by the Messengers. One can also judge from 
this how terrible it will be. This knowledge will fill one with such fear that 
will keep one on the Straight Way."<br><br>Now let us consider the question: How 
are these historical events a Sign of the Hereafter and the chastisement 
therein. Everyone who makes a critical study of history with this consideration 
that it is not merely a collection of events but also a means of drawing logical 
conclusions, will find that the rise and fall of communities and nations has 
been taking place in a regular succession. Moreover, one will find that this 
rise and fall takes place in accordance with some moral laws in an extraordinary 
way. This is a clear proof that man is subordinate to the Sovereign, Who is 
ruling over the universe in accordance with some rational moral laws. 
Accordingly, He raises up those who keep the moral limits above a certain 
minimum standard set for this purpose and degrades those who fall below it. Then 
He gives respite to the latter to mend their ways, but if they do not avail of 
it and continue their downward march and fall below the limit set for their 
complete degradation, He annihilates them in a way as to serve as a lesson for 
others. The fact that these events always take place in a regular cycle leaves 
no shadow of doubt that rewards and punishments are permanent parts of the law 
of His Kingdom.<br><br>A further consideration of the chastisements that were 
inflicted on different communities shows that, though these punishments 
fulfilled the demands of justice to some extent, there was still need of more to 
fulfill all the demands of justice, for these criminals were punished only for 
those sins which they themselves committed but not for those committed by the 
succeeding communities, which followed the bad example left by them as their 
predecessors. It is obvious from the study of history that the law of 
retribution must take its course and justice demands that they should be 
punished for the evil legacy they left for others to follow after them. 
Commonsense and justice demand that life in this world should be reproduced in 
its entirety in order to fulfill all the demands of the law of retribution. The 
just Sovereign will, therefore, bring into existence all those people for this 
purpose and award them due punishments.<br><br>(Please see also E.N. 10 of 
Yunus). <br><br>106This is to warn these foolish people who depend on the 
promises of Their intercessors that they would protect them from the torment of 
the Day. They have been warned to desist from the evil deeds they are committing 
in the hope that their intercessors would not rest content till they succeed in 
obtaining froth Allah permits of forgiveness for their sinful followers. This is 
because they believe them to be the beloved favorites of Allah Who cannot afford 
to displease them at any cost. Then they have been told that, not to speak of 
wielding any such influence, they shall not dare utter a word except with His 
permission. No saint, no angel, howsoever high, is so powerful or influential as 
to speak a word or make any recommendation in the Court of the Highest Sovereign 
unless He Himself permits it. Therefore such people as make offerings to others 
than Allah will be utterly disillusioned and disappointed on that Day, for they 
will come to know that they were foolish in relying on their intercessors and 
committing evil deeds in the world in the hope that they would deliver them from 
the torment of the Day.<br><br>107In vv. 105-106, the words "the earth and the 
heavens" might have been used idiomatically to denote the everlasting state of 
their torment or they might refer to the new earth and the heavens that will be 
made in the Next World. Anyhow these cannot be the earth and the heavens in 
their existing state for two reasons. First, according to the Qur'an, they shall 
be changed on the Day of Resurrection. Secondly, the events that are being 
related in these verses will happen in the Hereafter.<br><br>108This is to 
emphasize that there is no power that can deliver them from that everlasting 
torment. Of course, Allah has full powers to forgive anyone He wills or to make 
a change in the term of the torment of anyone, for He Himself devises laws for 
Himself and there is no law higher than His Law so as to limit His powers.<br>
<br>109That is, "They will not be sent to the Garden nor will dwell there in 
accordance with any extraneous law which might have forced Allah to let them 
dwell therein anyhow. They shall dwell there simply because of His favor. He has 
full powers to make any changes, if He will, about them."<br><br>110It does not 
mean at all that the Holy Prophet had any doubts concerning their deities. 
Though these words have been addressed to the Holy Prophet, as a matter of fact 
they are meant for the common people. What they mean is this: "No reasonable 
person should entertain any presumption that the people who worship the deities 
must have been convinced of their miraculous powers, otherwise they would not 
have worshiped them nor offered gifts to them nor invoked their help" . The fact 
of the matter is that their worship, their offerings and their prayers are not 
based on any knowledge nor any experience nor any real observation, but are the 
result of blind imitation of their forefathers. The proof of their falsehood is 
that the deities could not save them,when Allah's scourge visited their 
worshipers who were completely annihilated in spite of them.<br><br>111It means 
this: "There is nothing new in the different opinions expressed by different 
people regarding the Qur'an. They behaved in the same manner towards the Book 
that was given to Prophet Moses. Therefore, O Muhammad, do not be disheartened 
by their rejection of the Qur'an, though its teachings are simple and plain. "<br>
<br>112This is to reassure the Holy Prophet and the believers that they should 
patiently wait for the consequences of the misbehavior of the unbelievers 
towards the Qur'an ways. But this will happen in due course as previously 
ordained by Allah for Allah does not make haste in passing judgment, though the 
people demand haste.<br><br>113This was to urge Salat at three times, that is, 
Morning, Evening and `Isha. This shows that this was revealed before Salat had 
been made obligatory five times a day during the Mi'raj. (For explanation, see 
E.N. 95 of XVII, E.N. 111 of XX, and E.N. 124 of XXX). <br><br>114This is the 
remedy for eradicating evil from the world: "Do good deeds and defeat evil with 
them. The best way of making you virtuous is to establish salat, which will 
remind you of Allah over and over again: which will produce those good 
characteristics in you that shall help you fight successfully against the 
systematic and united front of evil that has been formed against the Mission of 
the Truth. This will also enable you to establish practically the system of 
virtue and reform." (For explanation see E.N.'s 77-79 of XXIX).<br><br>115In 
this passage, the real cause of the fall of the communities mentioned in vv. 
25-99 has been pointed out in a very instructive manner. In reviewing their 
history Allah declares that the cause of the downfall of not only these but of 
all the former communities was this: when Allah bestowed His favors on them, 
they abused these favors and were so intoxicated with their own prosperity that 
they began to make mischief in the land. By and by their collective conscience 
became so corrupt that no righteous persons were left among them to forbid evil, 
and, if a few were left, their voice was so weak that they could not prevent 
them from causing mischief. As a result of this, evil became so strong and 
prevalent among them as to warrant the scourge of Allah. Otherwise Allah bears 
no enmity against His servants that He should destroy them without any just 
cause, while they were performing righteous works. This has been mentioned here 
for impressing the following three things:<br><br>First, it is imperative that 
there should be some persons who should invite the people to virtue and forbid 
evil. For Allah approves virtue only and tolerates evil for its sake so long as 
there is any potential good left in them. But when a community has no righteous 
persons left in it and contains only wicked ones, or even if there be some such 
righteous persons in it as are so weak that nobody pays any heed to them, and 
the community as a whole rushes headlong towards moral degradation, then Allah's 
scourge becomes its inevitable doom.<br><br>Second, a community, which tolerates 
everything and everyone except those few who invite it to righteous deeds seals 
its own doom and invites its destruction.<br><br>Third, it is clear from this 
passage that the destiny of a community is determined by the influence the 
righteous people can wield in it. If it contains such a number of good persons 
as may be able to eradicate evil and mischief and establish virtue and 
righteousness, a general scourge is withheld from it so as to afford an 
opportunity to them for carrying on their work of reform. On the other hand, if 
the number of the righteous persons in it remains too small to carry on the 
reform work, and the community does not tolerate them at all and does not allow 
them to perform their 'reform work, then that community incurs its own 
destruction, for thus it proves itself to be a worthless community which has no 
justification for its existence. (For further explanation, See E.N. 34 of LI).<br>
<br>116This is the answer to the objection raised in the name of (taqdir) 
(destiny) against the principle that has been laid down in the preceding verse 
for the destruction of the wicked communities. It is this: Why should these 
communities be punished for lack of a sufficient number of righteous persons in 
them? Why didn't Allah Himself will to produce that sufficient number of 
righteous persons in it? Allah has answered this objection, so as to say: "It is 
not the will of Allah to .bind mankind inherently to a fixed course of life as 
He has bound the vegetable and animal life. Had it been so, there would have 
been no need of sending the Messengers and the Books for inviting mankind to the 
Faith. For in that case all human beings would have been born-Muslims and born 
Believers and there would have been no unbelief and no disobedience. But it is 
the will of Allah to grant freedom of choice and action to man so that he may be 
free to choose and follow any way of life. That is why He has left open both the 
way to Paradise and the way to Hell for man and given every individual and every 
community the opportunity to choose and follow either of the two ways with full 
freedom and win any of the two abodes as a result of one's own efforts and 
exertions. It is obvious that this scheme of Allah demands that it should be 
based on the freedom of choice and the option to adopt Faith or unbelief. This 
is why Allah does not compel a community to the right way if it itself intends 
to follow the wrong way, and plans and works for it. Allah's scheme does not 
interfere with the plans and works of such a community. When it makes deliberate 
arrangements to mold the wicked, unjust, and sinful people, He does not supply 
it with righteous persons by birth to set it right. Every community is free to 
produce good or bad people as it wills. And if a community wills to follow a 
wrong way as a community, leaving little room for the production and the 
development of the righteous people in order to raise up the standard of virtue, 
God does not will to coerce it to follow the righteous way. He will let it 
follow the way it chooses for itself with its inevitable consequences. On the 
contrary, Allah shows His mercy to that community which produces a sufficiently 
large number of such people as accept the invitation to virtue, and leaves room 
in its collective system for such people to work for its reform and 
purification. (For further explanation, See E.N. 24 of VI).<br><br>117At the end 
of the discourse, Allah has warned the champions of kufr, and comforted the 
believers, so as to say, "Allah is closely watching the behaviors of both the 
parties in the conflict between kufr and Islam, and the Sovereign is fully aware 
of all that is happening in His Kingdom. He is watching and controlling 
everything with perfect wisdom. He will reward richly the champions of the Truth 
and will not let go waste their efforts and exertions. And though He is showing 
tolerance to the champions of kufr, and giving them respite, He will take them 
to task because they are unjustly persecuting the standard bearers of the Truth 
and are spreading chaos in the land, and exerting their utmost to put obstacles 
in the way of the work of reform. All these things are in the knowledge of Allah 
and the evil-doers shall have to bear the consequences of their misdeeds, and 
the true believers will ultimately come out successful." </p>
