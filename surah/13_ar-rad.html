Each one runs (its course) for a term appointed. He doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.</li><li class="collection-item"> And it is He who spread out the earth, and set thereon mountains standing firm and (flowing) rivers: and fruit of every kind He made in pairs, two and two: He draweth the night as a veil o´er the Day. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who consider!</li><li class="collection-item"> And in the earth are tracts (diverse though) neighbouring, and gardens of vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees - growing out of single roots or otherwise: watered with the same water, yet some of them We make more excellent than others to eat. Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who understand!</li><li class="collection-item"> If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: "When we are (actually) dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?" They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)!</li><li class="collection-item"> They ask thee to hasten on the evil in preference to the good: Yet have come to pass, before them, (many) exemplary punishments! But verily thy Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind for their wrong-doing, and verily thy Lord is (also) strict in punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah doth know what every female (womb) doth bear, by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or do exceed. Every single thing is before His sight, in (due) proportion.</li><li class="collection-item"> He knoweth the unseen and that which is open: He is the Great, the Most High.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it openly; whether he lie hid by night or walk forth freely by day.</li><li class="collection-item"> For each (such person) there are (angels) in succession, before and behind him: They guard him by command of Allah. Allah does not change a people´s lot unless they change what is in their hearts. But when (once) Allah willeth a people´s punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find, besides Him, any to protect.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope: It is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with (fertilising) rain!</li><li class="collection-item"> Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe: He flingeth the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will..yet these (are the men) who (dare to) dispute about Allah, with the strength of His power (supreme)!</li><li class="collection-item"> For Him (alone) is prayer in Truth: any others that they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths but it reaches them not: for the prayer of those without Faith is nothing but (futile) wandering (in the mind).</li><li class="collection-item"> Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth do prostrate themselves to Allah (Acknowledging subjection),- with good-will or in spite of themselves: so do their shadows in the morning and evenings.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "(It is) Allah." Say: "Do ye then take (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as have no power either for good or for harm to themselves?" Say: "Are the blind equal with those who see? Or the depths of darkness equal with light?" Or do they assign to Allah partners who have created (anything) as He has created, so that the creation seemed to them similar? Say: "Allah is the Creator of all things: He is the One, the Supreme and Irresistible."</li><li class="collection-item"> He sends down water from the skies, and the channels flow, each according to its measure: But the torrent bears away to foam that mounts up to the surface. Even so, from that (ore) which they heat in the fire, to make ornaments or utensils therewith, there is a scum likewise. Thus doth Allah (by parables) show forth Truth and Vanity. For the scum disappears like forth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. Thus doth Allah set forth parables.</li><li class="collection-item"> For those who respond to their Lord, are (all) good things. But those who respond not to Him,- Even if they had all that is in the heavens and on earth, and as much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom. For them will the reckoning be terrible: their abode will be Hell,- what a bed of misery!</li><li class="collection-item"> Is then one who doth know that that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth, like one who is blind? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition;-</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who fulfil the covenant of Allah and fail not in their plighted word;</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who join together those things which Allah hath commanded to be joined, hold their Lord in awe, and fear the terrible reckoning;</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who patiently persevere, seeking the countenance of their Lord; Establish regular prayers; spend, out of (the gifts) We have bestowed for their sustenance, secretly and openly; and turn off Evil with good: for such there is the final attainment of the (eternal) home,-</li><li class="collection-item"> Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto them from every gate (with the salutation):</li><li class="collection-item"> "Peace unto you for that ye persevered in patience! Now how excellent is the final home!"</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who break the Covenant of Allah, after having plighted their word thereto, and cut asunder those things which Allah has commanded to be joined, and work mischief in the land;- on them is the curse; for them is the terrible home!</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah doth enlarge, or grant by (strict) measure, the sustenance (which He giveth) to whomso He pleaseth. (The wordly) rejoice in the life of this world: But the life of this world is but little comfort in the Hereafter.</li><li class="collection-item"> The Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" Say: "Truly Allah leaveth, to stray, whom He will; But He guideth to Himself those who turn to Him in penitence,-</li><li class="collection-item"> "Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah: for without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.</li><li class="collection-item"> "For those who believe and work righteousness, is (every) blessedness, and a beautiful place of (final) return."</li><li class="collection-item"> Thus have we sent thee amongst a People before whom (long since) have (other) Peoples (gone and) passed away; in order that thou mightest rehearse unto them what We send down unto thee by inspiration; yet do they reject (Him), the Most Gracious! Say: "He is my Lord! There is no god but He! On Him is my trust, and to Him do I turn!"</li><li class="collection-item"> If there were a Qur´an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak, (this would be the one!) But, truly, the command is with Allah in all things! Do not the Believers know, that, had Allah (so) willed, He could have guided all mankind (to the right)? But the Unbelievers,- never will disaster cease to seize them for their (ill) deeds, or to settle close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass, for, verily, Allah will not fail in His promise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Mocked were (many) messengers before thee: but I granted respite to the unbelievers, and finally I punished them: Then how (terrible) was my requital!</li><li class="collection-item"> Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: "But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?" Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path.

<p><strong>Name</strong></p>
This Surah takes its name from the word (ar-Ra'ad) (thunder) that occurs in v. 
13. It is merely the symbolic name of the Surah and does not in any way mean 
that the Surah deals with the scientific problems connected with thunder.<br>
<br>
<strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br>
<br>
The internal evidence (vv. 27-31 and vv. 34-48) shows that this Surah was 
revealed in the last stage of the Mission of the Holy Prophet at Makkah and 
during the same period in which Surahs Yunus, Hud and Al- A'araf were sent down. 
The manner of speech indicates that a long time had passed since the Holy 
Prophet had been conveying the Message. On the one hand, his opponents had been 
contriving different devices to defeat him and his Mission, and, on the other, 
his followers had been expressing a desire that by showing a miracle the 
disbelievers might be brought to the Right Way. In answer, Allah impressed on 
the Believers that it is not His way to convert people by this method and that 
they should not lose heart, if He is giving the enemies of the Truth a rope long 
enough to hang themselves. Otherwise, He is able to show such signs as may bring 
the dead out of their graves and make them speak (v. 31), but even then these 
obdurate people will invent an excuse to explain this away. All this decisive 
evidence clearly proves that this Surah was revealed during the last stage of 
the Prophet's Mission at Makkah.<br>
<br>
<strong>Central Theme</strong><br>
<br>
The first verse enunciates the main theme of this Surah, that is, "The Message 
of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) is the very Truth, but it is the fault 
of the people that they are rejecting it." This is the pivot on which the whole 
Surah turns. This is why it has been shown over and over again in different ways 
that the basic components of the Message -- Tauhid, Resurrection and Prophethood-are 
a reality: therefore they should believe sincerely in these for their own moral 
and spiritual good. They have been warned that they shall incur their own ruin 
if they reject them, for kufr by itself is sheer folly and ignorance. Moreover, 
the aim of the Surah is not merely to satisfy the minds but also to appeal to 
the hearts to accept the Faith. Therefore it does not merely put forward logical 
arguments in support of the truth of the Message and against the people's wrong 
notions, but at appropriate intervals it makes frequent use of sympathetic and 
earnest appeals to win over their hearts by warning them of the consequences of 
kufr and by holding out the happy rewards of Faith so that the foolish people 
should give up their obduracy.<br>
<br>
Besides this, the objections of the opponents have been answered without any 
mention of them, and those doubts which are proving a hindrance in the way of 
the Message or were being created by the opponents have been removed. At the 
same time, the Believers; who had been passing through long and hard ordeal and 
were feeling tired, and waiting anxiously for Allah's succor, have been 
comforted and filled with hope and courage.</p>
<hr>
<p>1This is the introduction to this Surah, in which its aim and object has been 
enunciated in a few words. Allah has addressed the Holy Prophet to this effect: 
"O Prophet! most of your people arc rejecting the teachings of the Qur'an for 
one reason or the other, but the fact is that what We are sending down to you is 
the Truth whether people believe it or not."<br>
<br>
After this brief introduction, the discourse deals with the main subject of the 
Surah, which consists of three basic things. First, "The whole of the universe 
belongs to Allah alone, and none besides Him has any right to service and 
worship" . Second, "There is another life after this life, in which you shall 
have to render an account of all your actions." Third, "I am a Messenger of 
Allah: whatever I am presenting before you is not from myself but from Allah." 
As the people were rejecting these three things, these have been reiterated over 
and over again in various forms to remove doubts and objections from the minds 
of the disbelievers.<br>
<br>
2In other words, "Allah keeps the myriads of heavenly bodies in space without 
any visible and perceptible support." Though there is nothing apparent and 
visible that is supporting these bodies, yet there is an invariable and 
imperceptible Power which is not only holding and keeping each and everyone of 
these huge bodies including the earth we inhabit in their proper places and 
orbits but also does not let any collision take place between them.<br>
<br>
3For the fuller details of "He sat Himself on the Throne of His Kingdom," please 
refer to E.N. 41 of Al-Aaraf. Here the purpose will be served if it is 
understood that this thing has been mentioned in the Qur'an at many places in 
order to bring out clearly the fact that Allah has not only created the earth, 
but also rules over His Kingdom, and that His universe is a factory that is not 
working automatically as some ignorant people seem to think nor is it being 
ruled by many gods as other ignorant people seem to believe. But it is a regular 
system that is being run and ruled over by its Creator.<br>
<br>
4It should be noted here that the addressees themselves accepted the truth of 
all the claims that have been made in this verse. Therefore no proofs were 
required of the facts that it is Allah Who raised up the heavens without any 
visible support and subjected the sun and the moon to a fixed order. These 
things have been mentioned here only as arguments to prove that Allah is the 
sole Sovereign and ruler of the whole universe.<br>
<br>
Now let us consider this question: How can such an argument as this convince 
those who do not believe at all in the existence of God nor acknowledge that He 
is the Creator of the universe and the Director of all its affairs ? The answer 
is that the arguments in support of the Doctrine of Tauhid advanced in the 
Qur'an to convince the mushriks equally apply against the atheists to prove the 
existence of God. It is like this: The whole of the universe-the earth, the 
moon, the sun and the countless heavenly bodies-constitute a perfect system 
which is working, under the same all-powerful Law. This is a proof that such a 
system must have been designed by some All-Powerful Sovereign, Who possesses 
wisdom and unerring knowledge. This proves conclusively the existence of that 
Allah Who has no other equal nor associate nor partner. For there can be no 
system without an administrator, no law without a ruler, no wisdom without a 
sage, and no knowledge without the possessor of that knowledge. Above all, no 
one can ever conceive that there can be any creation without a Creator except 
the one who is obdurate or has no sense left in him at all.<br>
<br>
5This system is not only a standing proof of the fact that an All-Powerful 
Sovereign is ruling over it, but is also an evidence of the great wisdom 
underlying it; it also bears witness that there is nothing ever-lasting in it. 
Everything in it remains for a fixed term after which it comes to an end. This 
is equally true for each and every component part of it as well as for the whole 
system. It is quite evident from its physical structure that there is nothing 
ever-lasting and immortal. There must be some fixed term for the system as a 
whole, after the expiry of which it shall come to an end. Then there shall be 
another world: therefore it is most likely that there shall be Resurrection as 
predicted in the Qur'an: nay, its inevitability is beyond any doubt. <br>
<br>
6Allah makes plain those Signs which help prove the truth of what the Holy 
Prophet was informing them. These Signs are spread all over the universe and 
everyone who observes these with open eyes can perceive that the realities 
towards which the Qur'an invites the people are testified by these Signs.<br>
<br>
7The preceding Signs have been cited to prove two things. First, the universe 
has only one Creator and Administrator. Second, there shall be life in the 
Hereafter in which everyone shall be judged in the Divine Court and awarded 
rewards and punishments on merit. As the first thing was quite obvious, it has 
not been mentioned in the conclusion drawn from the Signs. But the second thing, 
life in the Hereafter, has been mentioned because that was rather hidden from 
perception. Therefore it has specifically been stated that these Signs have been 
made plain in order "to convince you that you shall meet your Lord in the 
Hereafter and render an account of all your actions in this world."<br>
<br>
Now let us consider how these Signs help prove life in the Hereafter. These make 
it evident in two ways:<br>
<br>
(1) When we consider how big heavenly bodies as the sun and the moon are 
completely subject to the will of Allah, our hearts feel convinced that Allah 
Who has created these things and regulated their movements so orderly around 
their orbits, has undoubtedly the power to bring to life the whole human race 
after its death.<br>
<br>
(2) The terrestrial system also proves that its Creator is All-Wise. Therefore 
it can never be imagined that the All-Wise Creator could have created man and 
endowed him with wisdom and intelligence and invested him with power and 
authority, and then left him free to do what he liked with these, without being 
responsible and accountable for their use or abuse. For His Wisdom demands that 
He should take full account of all the acts and deeds of man in this world. It 
requires that. He should take to task those who committed aggressions and 
compensate their victims and He should give rewards to those who practiced 
virtue and punishments to those who did wicked deeds. In short, His Wisdom 
requires that He should call to account every human being and demand: "How did 
you carry out the trust that was placed in your hands in the shape of your 
wonderful body with its wonderful faculties and the numerous resources of the 
earth?" It may be that a foolish and unjust ruler of this world might entrust 
the affairs of his kingdom in the hands of his agents and then forget to call 
them to account, but such a thing can never be expected from the All-Wise and 
All-Knowing Allah.<br>
<br>
It is this way of observing and considering the heavenly bodies that can 
convince us that life in the Hereafter is both possible and inevitable.<br>
<br>
8After citing some heavenly Signs in support of the doctrines of Tauhid and the 
Hereafter, a few Signs are being cited from the earth for the same purpose. 
Briefly the following are the arguments for Tauhid, Resurrection and 
Accountability:<br>
<br>
(1) Tauhid: The fact that the earth is closely connected with the heavenly 
bodies (which help create life on it), and the fact that the mountains and the 
rivers are so inter-related with that life are clear proofs that all these 
things have not been created by separate and different gods nor are being 
governed, by gods with independent powers and authorities. Had it been so, there 
could not have been so much harmony, congruity, accord and unity of purpose 
among them; nor could these relationships have continued for such a long time. 
For it is quite obvious that if there had not been One All-Powerful and All-Wise 
Allah, it could not have been possible and practicable for different gods to sit 
together and evolve out such a harmonious system of the universe without any 
discord or conflict between its myriads of bodies.<br>
<br>
(2) Resurrection: This wonderful planet, the earth, is itself a great proof that 
its Creator is All-Powerful and can, therefore, raise the dead whenever He will. 
For it is floating in space round the sun and it has high mountains fixed in it 
and has large rivers flowing on its surface: it produces countless fruit-bearing 
trees and it brings about the cycles of the day and the night with precise 
regularity.<br>
<br>
All these things bear witness to the boundless power of its Creator. It would, 
therefore, be sheer folly to doubt that such All-Powerful Creator is incapable 
of raising mankind to life after death.<br>
<br>
(3) Accountability: The earth, with all its wonderful and purposeful signs, is a 
clear evidence of the fact that its Creator is All-Wise. Therefore it cannot 
even be imagined that He has created man, His noblest creation, without any 
purpose. Just as His wisdom is apparent from the structure of the earth, its 
mountains, its rivers, the pairs of its trees and fruits, its night and day, so 
it is quite obvious that it has not been made the habitation of man without any 
purpose, nor will it be brought to naught without the fulfillment of that 
purpose. Clearly mankind shall be accountable to its Creator for the fulfillment 
of that Divine purpose.<br>
<br>
9That is, "If you observe carefully, you will find Divine wisdom, design and 
purpose in the diversity of the structure of the earth. Though it has countless 
regions adjoining one another, they are different from one another in their 
shapes, colors, component parts, characteristics, potentialities, productive 
capacity and source of minerals. This diversity has countless points of wisdom 
and advantage. Let alone other creatures, if we consider the diversity of 
regions from the point of the good it has done to mankind, we shall have to 
acknowledge that this is the result of the well-thought and well-planned design 
of the All-Wise Creator. For this diversity has helped the growth of human 
civilization so much that only an unreasonable person can assign this to mere 
accident.<br>
<br>
10Some of the date-palm trees have only a single trunk from the root while 
others have two or more stems from the same root.<br>
<br>
11The things mentioned in this verse contain many other Signs besides the proofs 
of Tauhid and the boundless powers and All-Comprehensive Wisdom of Allah. Let us 
consider one of these, that is the diversity in the universe, including mankind. 
There is the one and the same earth but all its regions are quite different from 
one another. Then there is one and the same water but it helps to produce 
different kinds of corn and fruits. Then one and the same tree bears fruits 
which, in spite of likeness, differ from one another in shapes, sizes, and other 
features. Then there is one and the same root from which sometimes one and at 
others two trunks sprout up, with their own different characteristics. If one 
considers these aspects of diversity, one shall come to the conclusion that the 
Divine wisdom demands the same kind of diversity in the natures, temperaments 
and inclinations of human beings, and, therefore, in their conducts. So, one 
need not worry about the existence of this diversity. As it has been stated in 
v. 31, if Allah had willed, He could have created all human beings alike and 
virtuous by birth. But the wisdom that underlies the creation of the universe, 
including mankind, requires diversity and not uniformity. Otherwise, all this 
creation would have become meaningless.<br>
<br>
12They "have denied their Lord": their denial of the Hereafter is, in fact, the 
denial of the Power and Wisdom of Allah. As they say that it is impossible to 
bring them again to life after their death, it implies that, God forbid, their 
Allah Who has created them lacks not only power but wisdom, too.<br>
<br>
13As a collar around the neck is a symbol of imprisonment, the words "collars 
around their necks" have been used here idiomatically to show that they are 
slaves of ignorance, obduracy, lust and are blind followers of their 
forefathers. As their thinking is influenced by their prejudices, they cannot 
believe in the Hereafter and would deny this, though there is every reason to 
believe that it is inevitable.<br>
<br>
14This refers to the demand of the Quraish from the Holy Prophet "If you are a 
true Prophet of God, why don't you hasten to bring that scourge of God on us of 
which you have been threatening us, when we are flouting and denying you ?" They 
did this in different ways. Sometimes they would invoke God mockingly and say, 
"O Lord, settle our accounts now and do not postpone these to the Day of 
Resurrection" . At another time, they would say, "Our Lord, if what Muhammad 
says be true, and be from Thee, then stone us from the sky or send down some 
other scourge upon us from the sky or send down some other painful torment upon 
us." In this verse an answer has been given to such impudent demands of the 
disbelievers. They have been admonished to refrain from such foolish demands and 
avail of the respite that was being given to them and mend their ways, for they 
were incurring the wrath of God by adopting the attitude of rebellion. <br>
<br>
15This showed their mentality. The only criterion of judging whether Muhammad 
(Allah's peace be upon him) was a true Prophet or not according to these 
disbelievers, was whether he would perform a miracle to order. This was because 
they would not judge his Message by rational arguments: they would not learn a 
lesson from his high character nor from the moral revolution that was being 
brought about among his Companions by his Message and noble example: nor would 
they carefully consider the rational arguments given in the Qur'an to prove the 
errors of their religion of shirk and superstitions of ignorance. They would 
ignore these rational things and demand a miracle to decide the issue.<br>
<br>
16This is the concise answer to their demand, though it has not been directly 
addressed to the disbelievers but to the Messenger. It is this: "O Prophet, you 
should not worry at all about some miracle which you might show to these people 
in order to convince them, for it is not a part of your Mission. Your duty is 
only to warn the people of their negligence and of the evil consequences of 
their wrong ways. And for this purpose, We have always sent a guide to every 
people. Now you, too, are performing this duty, and it is for them to open their 
eyes and judge the truth of your Message." After giving this concise answer, 
Allah overlooks their demand but warns them, in the succeeding verses, that they 
have to deal with the All-Knowing Allah Who has full knowledge about everyone of 
them from the time they were in the wombs of their mothers, and Who keeps a keen 
watch over everything they do. Therefore their fates shall be decided strictly 
with justice in accordance with their merits and that there is no power on the 
earth and in the heavens that can influence in the least His decisions and 
judgments.<br>
<br>
17When amplified the verse will mean : Allah remains fully aware of all the 
developments that take place in the child while in its mother's womb, and He 
watches over the decrease or increase in each of its limbs, and its 
potentialities, capabilities and powers.<br>
<br>
18That is, "Allah not only directly watches over whatever each person does, and 
is fully aware of everything he does, but He has also appointed such Guardians 
as accompany him everywhere and keep a full record of all his deeds." This has 
been stated here to warn those people who live their lives under the delusion 
that they have been left absolutely free to do whatever they like and shall not 
be required to render an account of what they did in this worldly life. The 
warning is that such people invite their own retribution.<br>
<br>
19This is to warn them further that they should not remain under any delusion 
that some holy person or saint or angel has the power to rescue them froth 
Divine Retribution, for there is none who could defend them against Allah, even 
though they might have been paying homages and making offerings to their 
so-called patrons and protectors in the hope that they would rescue them froth 
punishment from Allah on the Day of Judgment.<br>
<br>
20The thunder is a proclamation of Tauhid for those who have ears to hear the 
real meaning of its loud noise which follows the flash of lightning, though it 
is merely a kind of noise for those who hear it like animals. For it proclaims 
that Allah Who raises clouds from the oceans and carries them wherever He wills, 
and makes the lightning flash from the clouds and then turns them into rain so 
as to supply water to the dwellers of the earth, is perfect and worthy of all 
praise, is All-Wise and All-Powerful and is flawless in every respect and has do 
partner whatsoever. <br>
<br>
21The mention of the fact that the angels are filled with awe of their Lord, and 
they proclaim His praise has a special significance here. This is to refute the 
shirk of the ignorant people who have always worshiped the angels as gods and 
deities and believed them to be partners with God in His Godhead. It has been 
stated that they are not partners with Allah but His most obedient servants; so 
much so that they praise Him and are filled with awe of Him.<br>
<br>
22He has countless plans and measures which are so effective and sudden that He 
can smite any one with any one of them from any side He will. So much so that 
the intended victim is absolutely unaware of it. This is a proof that those 
people, who say absurd things about such All-Powerful Being, are absolutely void 
of sense.<br>
<br>
23"To invoke Him alone is the right thing," for Allah alone has the power and 
the authority to give help and remove difficulties. <br>
<br>
24"... everything in the heavens and the earth bows down before Allah" in the 
same sense that every creation of His has to obey and submit to His Physical Law 
in every detail. The only difference between the submission of a Believer and an 
unbeliever is that the former submits to it with a willing heart while the 
latter is forced to do so against his will, for it is absolutely beyond his 
power to oppose it.<br>
<br>
25"The shadows bow down" in the sense that they fall to the west in the morning 
and to the cast in the evening and so on. This shows that they, too, have to 
submit to some Law.<br>
<br>
26It will be worth while to note that though the question, "Who is the Lord of 
the heavens and the earth?" was put to the disbelievers, Allah told the Holy 
Prophet to answer it himself and say, "Allah". This was because the disbelievers 
hesitated to answer it one way or the other. They could not say that it was not 
Allah for they themselves believed that Allah was the Creator of everything. On 
the other hand, they could not acknowledge this fact in so many words in answer 
to such question, for, they would, then, have to acknowledge the doctrine of 
Tauhid for no basis could have been left in favor of shirk. As they realized 
their weak position, they would not give any answer to such questions. That is 
why Allah asks His Messenger to put such questions to the disbelievers: "Who is 
the Creator of the heavens and the earth? Who is the Lord of the Universe? Who 
sustains you with provisions of life?" When they do not give any answer to such 
questions, Allah asks His Messenger to say "Allah" in answer. He then proceeds 
on with this argument: "When Allah does all these things, how do the deities you 
worship come in?" <br>
<br>
27The blind man is the person who cannot see any of the countless signs of the 
Oneness of Allah, though these lie spread over before him in the universe. On 
the other hand, the seeing man is the person who can see in every particle of 
the universe and in every leaf of grass and tree Signs pointing to their 
Creator. Thus the question that has been posed means: "O disbelievers ! if you 
are blind to the Signs, why should the one who can see the Signs should behave 
like a blind man and stumble along like you?"<br>
<br>
28Here "light" means the light of the knowledge of the Truth which the Holy 
Prophet and his followers possessed. In contrast to this, there was the 
"darkness" of ignorance in which the disbelievers were wandering about. The 
question that has been posed means to ask this: "Why should those, who have got 
the `light', extinguish it and wander about in the darkness like you? Well, if 
you do not know the worth of the `light', you may choose to wander in the 
darkness, but how can you expect the one who has got the 'light', who 
appreciates the difference between the light and the darkness, and who is seeing 
the right way as if in broad daylight, to Dave the light and wander about in the 
darkness?"<br>
<br>
29The question is intended to impress on the disbelievers that there is 
absolutely no reason why they should practice shirk. When they themselves admit 
that their gods did not create even an iota in the universe and that they have 
not even the smallest and most insignificant share in the creation, there 
remains no ground for them to cherish any doubts about it. Why should, then, 
their false gods and deities share the rights and powers of the Real Creator?<br>
<br>
30The Arabic word (Qah-har) literally means "the one who rules over all by 
virtue of one's own power, and keeps all under one's complete control."<br>
<br>
This fact that "He is the Unique, the Almighty" follows naturally from the 
preceding fact that "Allah alone is the Creator of everything," for this fact 
was also acknowledged by the mushriks and was never denied by them. This is so 
because the Creator of everything should logically be Unique, and every other 
thing or being must necessarily be His creation. Therefore nothing could be the 
equal of the Creator or partner in His Being, attributes, powers and rights. 
Likewise, the Creator must have complete power and control over His Creation.<br>
<br>
For it can never be imagined that the Creator would create anything over which 
He has not full control. Therefore, the one who acknowledges Allah to be the 
Creator must also acknowledge Him to be the Unique and the All-Powerful. After 
this, there remains no reason why one should worship any one other than the 
Creator or invoke some one else for help in resolving one's difficulties and 
fulfilling one's needs.<br>
<br>
31In this simile the Knowledge which had been sent down. by Allah to the Holy 
Prophet has been likened to the rain from the sky, and the Believers to the 
streams, rivulets and rivers. Just as the streams etc. , fill themselves with 
rain-water, each according to its capacity, so his followers gained knowledge 
from him, each according to his ability. On the other hand, the hue and cry that 
was raised by the opponents of the Islamic Movement has been likened to the 
swelling foam etc., that begins to dance about on the surface of flood water, 
but soon vanishes away.<br>
<br>
32As it is but natural that scum should appear on the surface when are melted in 
the furnace for purification, likewise bad people would come surface and take 
prominent part in persecuting the good people who are passed through the furnace 
of persecution for their purification.<br>
<br>
33This shows that the disbelievers would be in such a sad plight that they would 
not hesitate to give their all for their redemption.<br>
<br>
34".... they shall have the heavy reckoning": they shall have to bear the full 
consequences of their evil deeds. No sin, no shortcoming, in short, nothing will 
be forgiven and no evil shall go unpunished.<br>
<br>
We learn from the Qur'an that the rebels of Allah shall have to render a 
reckoning, whereas there shall be a "light" reckoning from those who have been 
faithful and obedient to their Lord. In consideration of their loyal services, 
their cases will be dealt with leniently, and taking their general goodness into 
account many of their shortcomings will be forgiven.<br>
<br>
This is further amplified by a Tradition of the Holy Prophet. Hadrat 'A'ishah 
relates, "I said, O Messenger of Allah! the most dreadful verse of the Qur'an is 
this: Whoso shall commit an evil, he shall be punished for it'. (IV :123). The 
Holy Prophet answered, O `A'ishah! don't you know how Allah clears the accounts 
of His faithful and obedient servant? Whatever harm or trouble he receives in 
this world-even so much as the pricking of a thorn-is taken by Allah as 
atonement for one or the other of his sins. As regards the Hereafter, everyone, 
who shall be called upon to render an account of any sin, shall be punished for 
it' . At this Hadrat `A'ishah asked, `Then what is meant by light reckoning in 
this verse: Whoso shall be given his `Conduct Register' in his right hand, he 
will render a light reckoning?' (LXXXIV:?-8). The Holy Prophet answered, `This 
means merely the presentation of his whole conduct, that is, all his deeds-good 
and bad-shall be presented before Allah but he shall not be called upon to clear 
the account of all his deeds; for the one who shall be called upon to clear the 
whole of his account, shall be totally ruined."<br>
<br>
The same thing is happening even in this world. A master deals very leniently 
with his faithful and obedient servant and connives at his minor faults and even 
forgives his major faults in consideration of his meritorious services. On the 
other hand, if a servant is proved to be treacherous and dishonest, no 
consideration is given even to his services, and he is punished both for his 
minor and for major faults.<br>
<br>
35That is, "As the attitude of the two in this world will be different from each 
other, so shall be their ultimate end in the Hereafter."<br>
<br>
36That is, "Those who listen to the Message that has been sent down by Allah, 
and accept His Messenger, are really very wise people. This is why their conduct 
in this world is quite different from those foolish people who are blind to its 
merits: and so is their ultimate end in the Hereafter, as stated in the 
subsequent verses".<br>
<br>
37This Covenant is the same that was made by Allah with the whole of mankind at 
the beginning of the creation that they would worship Him alone. (Please refer 
to E.N.'s 134 and 135 of Al-A`araf). As this Covenant has been made with every 
human being, it has been imbued firmly in human nature. When a human being is 
born in this world, he, so to say, confines the same Covenant because he owes 
his creation to the same Allah with Whom he had made that Covenant: then he is 
brought up by His Providence and fed and nourished with His Provisions, and uses 
the powers and faculties endowed by Him. AII these things bind him by themselves 
into a covenant of bondage with his Lord. It is obvious that wise, loyal and 
faithful people fulfill their Covenant and dare not break it except that they 
might break it unconsciously and unwillingly.<br>
<br>
38That is, "All those social and civil relations that are conducive to the 
correct and right conduct of collective human life."<br>
<br>
39"They show fortitude": they remain self-possessed and keep under control all 
their desires and lusts and do not transgress the bounds, and they do not yield 
to temptations to disobey their Lord in order to gain advantages and gratify 
their desires: nay, they bear with calm courage and endurance losses and 
afflictions that are inevitable in the obedience of Allah. If we consider the 
life of a believer from this point of view, we shall find that the whole of his 
life is the life of endurance and fortitude, for he keeps himself under control 
in very trying circumstances in this world in the hope of winning the approval 
of his Lord and in the expectation of gaining permanent benefits in the 
Hereafter: so he fights with fortitude every temptation to sin.<br>
<br>
40That is, "If others do evil to them, they do not do evil in return but do good 
instead: they do not fight mischief with mischief but with virtue. Howsoever 
unjust one may be to them, they do justice in every case. Likewise, they remain 
truthful and honest even in the cast of those who tell lies against them and 
show dishonesty towards them."<br>
<br>
There is a Tradition of the Holy Prophet to the same effect: "You should not 
imitate others in your conduct towards other people, for it is wrong to say, 'We 
will do goodness to others, if they do goodness to us and we will do injustice 
to them if they are unjust to us.' (On the other hand,) you should follow this 
principle: if others do goodness to you, you should do goodness to them, but if 
they do evil to you, you should not be unjust to them."<br>
<br>
There is another Tradition, which begins with the words: "My Lord has bidden me 
to do nine things. Four of these things are, I should behave justly towards 
everyone whether I am pleased or offended with him. I should render the right 
even of the one who violates my rights. I should pay the dues even of the one 
who depraves me of my due. I should forgive the one who has been unjust to me." 
There is yet another Tradition to the same effect: "Don't be faithless even to 
the one who has been faithless to you." There is also a saying of Hadrat 'Umar 
that amounts to the same thing. "The best way of punishing the one, who does not 
fear God in his dealings with you, is that you should fear God in your dealings 
with him."<br>
<br>
41This implies two things. The angels will come in large numbers from every side 
and give them this good news: "Now you have come to a place where there is peace 
for you. Here you arc immune from every affliction, every trouble, every 
hardship, and every danger and worry." (For details please see E.N. 29 of Al-Hijr).<br>
<br>
42This verse refutes the wrong criterion by which the disbelievers of Makkah 
(and all other foolish people of the world) judged whether one was or was not a 
favorite of God. They judged a man's worth by his wealth and worldly prosperity 
and not by his faith and righteous conduct. They thought that the one who was 
enjoying all the good things of life was a favorite of God, even if he had 
erroneous beliefs and did wicked deeds. On the other hand, they considered the 
one who was poor and indigent to be under the wrath of God, even though he was 
righteous. That is why in their judgment the chiefs of the Quraish were far 
superior to the followers of the Holy Prophet. They would say, "You can see for 
yourselves that God is with the chiefs of the Quraish."<br>
<br>
In this verse, Allah has warned there that they are absolutely wrong in drawing 
such a conclusion from the worldly conditions of the people. Allah gives His 
provision to the people abundantly or sparingly for reasons different from those 
which they presumed and richness or poverty is no criterion by which to judge 
the worth of people. The real criterion of judging the worth of people is their 
beliefs and deeds. The one, who has righteous beliefs and does good deeds, shall 
be higher in rank than the one who has wrong beliefs and does evil deeds. Thus 
the real criterion is the quality of one's deeds and not the possession or the 
lack of wealth.<br>
<br>
43Please also keep in view the answer that has been given to this question in 
v.7. <br>
<br>
44This is the answer to their question. It is not due to the lack of signs that 
they were going astray, but it is the lack of any desire in them to seek right 
guidance. For Allah does not force one to follow the Right Way, if he 
deliberately turns away from it. He lets such persons wander on the wrong ways 
they choose to wander. Nay, even all those things that should serve as a means 
to guidance for a seeker of truth, become the means of deviation for the one who 
seeks deviation. So much so that that very torch which helps show the way to the 
former, dazzles the eyes of the latter. This is how Allah Leads astray a person.<br>
<br>
This answer to the demand of a Sign is matchless in its eloquence. It says to 
them, "O foolish people! it is not due to the lack of Signs that you are not 
finding the right path, but it is due to the lack of any desire in you for it. 
You do not see any of the countless Signs that lie scattered all around you 
because you have no desire to go to the Right Way. How can then any Sign be 
helpful to you ? For you would not see any of those Signs. However, those who 
seek the Right Way to Allah, see these Signs and find the Right Way with their 
help."<br>
<br>
45That is, In this way that We have not given you a Sign they demanded.<br>
<br>
46That is, "Instead of serving that most Compassionate Lord, they are discarding 
His service and setting up other partners in His attributes, powers, rights and 
giving thanks to others for His blessings."<br>
<br>
47This verse has been addressed to the Believers who were feeling uneasy that no 
such Sign was being sent as was demanded by the disbelievers. They thought that 
such a Sign would convince the disbelievers and they would accept Islam. 
Therefore when no such Sign was sent, they became all the more uneasy for the 
lack of the fulfillment of the demand that gave rise to doubts about the 
Prophethood of the Messenger. The question posed in this verse is meant to 
remove that uneasiness of the Muslims. It is like this: "Do you think that they 
would have embraced Islam if such and such Signs had been shown to them all of a 
sudden along with a Surah of the Qur'an ? Are you under the delusion that they 
are quite ready to accept Islam and are waiting only for such a Sign ? Do you 
think that those people who have failed to see the light of the Truth in the 
teachings of the Qur'an, in the phenomena of the universe, in the pure and 
spotless life of the Holy Prophet and in the wonderful change in the lives of 
his Companions, would see the light of the Truth in the moving of the mountains, 
in the cleavage of the earth and in the coming out of the dead from the graves?"<br>
<br>
48"Allah has full power over everything" and can show any Sign if He so desires. 
He is not showing any Sign for it does not fit in the scheme laid down for the 
guidance of Man. As the real object is to show Guidance to mankind through the 
Prophet and not to compel them to believe in the Prophethood of a Prophet, He 
desires that the people should gain guidance by thinking and observing wisely 
and not by seeing Signs. <br>
<br>
49That is, "If the object had been to make human beings Believers even without 
consciously understanding it, Allah could have created them Believers by birth."<br>
<br>
50That is, "They are so audacious that they set up partners with Allah Whose 
knowledge is All-Comprehensive and Who is aware of even the minutest details of 
the good and bad actions of each individual."<br>
<br>
51These are the audacious things they do. They ascribe partners and equals to 
Him: they believe that some of His creatures are a part and parcel of His Being, 
and have attributes and rights like Him: they presume that they shall not be 
called to account for whatever they do, even though they live in His Kingdom.<br>
<br>
52That is, "You give empty names to the partners you ascribe to Him for you have 
no real knowledge about them." For you could get this knowledge only in one of 
the three following ways:<br>
<br>
First, You might have received some authentic information that Allah had made 
such and such people as His partners in His attributes, powers and rights. If it 
is so, please let us also know their names and the source of your information.<br>
<br>
The second possibility is that Allah might have remained ignorant that some 
beings have become His partners. Therefore you are going to inform Him about 
this. If it is so, please say it clearly in so many words so that it may be 
decided whether there are some foolish people who can believe in such a 
nonsensical claim.<br>
<br>
Obviously the above two suppositions are absurd. Therefore the only alternative 
is that, "You are ascribing partners to Him without any rhyme or reason, and you 
without any knowledge make one the relative of God, another the hearer of 
supplications, and still another the helper and fulfiller of certain needs and 
the ruler of a certain region etc."<br>
<br>
53Shirk has been called "fraud" because none of the angels, spirits, saints, 
heavenly bodies, to whom they ascribe Divine attributes and powers or render 
Divine rights, ever claimed to possess these attributes or powers, nor did they 
ever demand these rights from the people nor told the people that they would 
fulfill their desires and wants, if they would perform some rituals of worship 
before them. As a matter of fact, some clever people invented these gods in 
order to practice willful deception and dishonesty so that they might wield 
powerful influence over the common people and exploit them and deprive them of a 
part of their hard earned possessions. Accordingly, they made the common people 
credulous followers of the gods of their inventions and set themselves up as 
their representatives to get money, etc.., from them by this fraud.<br>
<br>
The second reason why shirk has been called "fraud" is that a worldly man 
pretends to believe in it not because he wants to believe in it but in order to 
free himself from all moral restraints to enable him to lead an irresponsible 
life of treed and lust.<br>
<br>
The third reason is given below in E. N . 54.<br>
<br>
54Shirk is also `fraud' in the sense that it has been made to appear fair for 
them and so leads them into deviation and prevents them from coming back to the 
Right Way. It is like this: When mushriks adopt wrong ways of deviation that 
suit the kind of lives they wish to lead, they have to invent arguments to 
pacify their consciences and convince other people that they are on the right 
way. Naturally this fraud confirms them on the way of deviation and they are 
debarred from the Right Way.<br>
<br>
55This is in reply to a specific objection which was then raised by the 
disbelievers. They would say, "If he has brought the same Message that was 
brought by the Messengers before him (as he claims). why don't the Jews and the 
Christians who are the followers of the former Prophets come forward and welcome 
it?" The verse answers the objection and says that the taste followers of the 
former Prophets really rejoice in the Message of the Qur'an, but the false ones 
have been offended at it. Then it asks the Holy Prophet not to worry at all 
about this, saying, "O Prophet, you should not mind at all whether they are 
pleased or offended at it. Tell them plainly that this is the Guidance I have 
received from my Lord and I will follow it at all costs."<br>
<br>
56This is the answer to another objection. The disbelievers said that Ire could 
not be a Prophet of Allah because he had wives and children, for they argued 
that Prophets had nothing to do with carnal desires.<br>
<br>
57This is the answer to yet another objection: "Had he been a taste Prophet, he 
would have shown a Sign like the shining hand and the miraculous staff of 
Prophet Moses or he would have restored sight to the blind or cured lepers like 
Prophet Jesus, or brought a Sign like the she-camel of Prophet Salih". The 
answer is this: "None of the former Messengers had any power to show any Sign 
nor has this Prophet: Allah showed a Sign whenever and through whomsoever He 
considered it to be necessary and will show any Sign whenever He will consider 
it necessary, and that I have not claimed to possess any such power that such a 
demand might be made from me."<br>
<br>
58This is the answer to another objection raised against the Revelation of the 
Qur'an. The disbelievers said, "What was the need of this new Book, when there 
already existed the former revealed Books? You say that this need has arisen 
because the former Books have been tampered with; therefore Allah has abrogated 
them and commanded that this new Book should be followed. This position you have 
taken is wrong for how can any one tamper with the Book of Allah and how is it 
possible that any Book of Allah might be tampered with? Why did not Allah 
protect these Books from such things as these? You say that this Book has been 
revealed by the same Allah Who revealed the Torah and the Gospel. Haw is it then 
that your way is different from that of the Torah? You consider certain things 
lawful while they are unlawful according to the Torah, etc. etc." Detailed 
answers to these objections have been given in other Surahs but here only a 
brief and comprehensive answer has been given to them.<br>
<br>
The Arabic word ( (Umm-ul-Kitab) literally means "the Mother Book", that is, the 
Original Book which is the Source and Origin of all the revealed Books.<br>
<br>
59This is to console the Holy Prophet, as if to say, "O Prophet, you need not 
concern yourself as to the end of these disbelievers who have rejected the 
Truth. You should go on performing with peace of mind the Mission that has been 
entrusted to you and leave it to Us to give them suitable punishment." Though 
this has been addressed to the Holy Prophet, it is obvious that it is really 
meant to warn the opponents of the Truth, who were demanding definitely from the 
Holy Prophet by way of a challenge to bring about the scourge about which 
threats were being held out to them.<br>
<br>
60"We are advancing in the land"= this is a very subtle way of warning the 
opponents of the Truth: "The fact that Our Message is spreading fast in Arabia 
does, in fact, mean that We Ourselves are advancing very fast in the country 
against you for We are with those who are carrying Our Message."<br>
<br>
"We are shrinking its boundaries for them"= "We are causing the influence of 
Islam to spread fast in the land and are thus reducing the boundaries of the 
influence of its opponents. Are not these things the portents of their coming 
disaster?"<br>
<br>
61That is, "These people, who are now devising schemes to defeat the Message of 
the Truth, do not take a lesson from the sad end of the people who devised 
similar schemes before them to suppress the voice of the Truth by falsehood, 
fraud and persecution."<br>
<br>
62That is "Everyone who has the knowledge of the Divinely revealed Books will 
bear witness to the fact that my teachings are the same that were imparted by 
the former prophets."<br>
