                        The Surah takes its name al-Mulk from the very first sentence.<br>

                        <strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br>

                        but the subject matter and the style indicate that it is one of the earliest
                        Surahs to be revealed at Makkah.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Theme and Subject Matter</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        In this surah, on the one hand, the teachings of Islam have been introduced
                        briefly, and, on the other, the people living in heedlessness have been aroused
                        from their slumber in a most effective way. A characteristic of the earliest
                        surahs of the Makkan period is that they present the entire teachings of Islam
                        and the object of the Holy Prophet's mission, not in detail, but briefly, so
                        that they are assimilated by the people easily. Moreover, they are particularly
                        directed to make the people shun heedlessness, to make them think, and to arouse
                        their dormant conscience.<br>
                        <br>
                        In the first five verses man has been made to realize that the universe in which
                        he lives is a most well organized and fortified Kingdom in which he cannot
                        detect any fault, any weakness or flaw, how ever hard he may try to probe. This
                        Kingdom has been brought from nothing into existence by Allah Almighty Himself
                        and All the powers of controlling, administering and ruling it are also entirely
                        in Allah's hand and His power is infinite. Besides, man has also been told that
                        in this wise system he has not been created without a purpose, but he has been
                        sent here for a test and in this test he can succeed only by his righteous deeds
                        and conduct.<br>
                        <br>
                        In vv. 6-11, dreadful consequences of disbelief which will appear in the
                        Hereafter have been mentioned, and the people told that Allah, by sending His
                        Prophets, has warned them of these consequences in this very world, as if to say
                        "Now, if you do not believe in what the Prophets say and correct your attitude
                        and behavior accordingly, in the Hereafter you will yourself have to admit that
                        you really deserved the punishment that was being meted out to you."<br>
                        <br>
                        In vv. 12-l4, the truth that has been impressed on the minds is that the Creator
                        cannot be unaware of His creation, as if to say: "He is aware of each open and
                        hidden secret of yours, even of the innermost ideas of your hearts. Hence, the
                        right basis of morality is that man should avoid evil, fearing the
                        accountability of the unseen God, whether in the world there is a power to take
                        him to task for this or not, and whether in the world there is a possibility of
                        being harmed by such a power or not. Those who adopt such a conduct in the world
                        alone will deserve forgiveness and a rich reward in the Hereafter."<br>
                        <br>
                        In vv. 15-23, making allusions, one after the other to those common truths of
                        daily occurrence, which man does not regard as worthy of much attention, he has
                        been invited to consider them seriously. It has been said: "Look: the earth on
                        which you move about with full satisfaction and peace of mind, and from which
                        you obtain your sustenance has been subdued for you by Allah; otherwise this
                        earth might at any time start shaking suddenly so as to cause your destruction,
                        or a typhoon might occur, which may annihilate you completely. Look at the birds
                        that fly above you; it is only Allah Who is sustaining them in the air. Look at
                        your own means and resources: if Allah wills to inflict you with a scourge, none
                        can save you from it; and if Allah wills to close the doors of sustenance on
                        you, none can open them for you. These things are there to make you aware of the
                        truth, but you see them like animals, which are unable to draw conclusions from
                        observations, and you do not use your sight, hearing and minds which Allah has
                        bestowed on you as men; that is why you do not see the right way."<br>
                        <br>
                        In vv. 24-27, it has been said: "You have ultimately to appear before your God
                        in any case. It is not for the Prophet to tell you the exact time and date of
                        the event. His only duty is to warn you beforehand of its inevitable occurrence.
                        Today you do not listen to him and demand that he should cause the event to
                        occur and appear prematurely before you; but when it does occur, and you see it
                        with your own eyes, you will then be astounded. Then, it will be said to you
                        "This is the very thing you were calling to be hastened."<br>
                        <br>
                        In vv. 28-29 replies have been given to what the disbelievers of Makkah said
                        against the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and his Companions. They cursed
                        the Holy Prophet and prayed for his and the believers destruction. To this it
                        has been said: "Whether those who call you to the right way are destroyed, or
                        shown mercy by Allah, how will their fate change your destiny? You should look
                        after yourselves and consider who would save you if you were overtaken by the
                        scourge of God? You regard those who believe in God and put their trust in Him as
                        the misguided. A time will come when it will become evident as to who was
                        misguided in actual truth.<br>
                        <br>
                        In conclusion, the people have been asked this question and left to ponder over
                        it "If the water which has come out from the earth at some place in the desert
                        or hill country of Arabia and upon which depends your whole life activity,
                        should sink and vanish underground, who beside Allah can restore to you this
                      life giving water?"</p>
                      <hr>
                      <p>1Tabaraka is a superlative from barkat. Barkat comprehends the meanings of
                        exaltation and greatness, abundance and plentifulness, permanence and
                        multiplicity of virtues and excellences. When the superlative tabaraka is formed
                        from it, it gives the meaning that Allah is infinitely noble and great; He is
                        superior to everything beside Himself in His essence and attributes and works;
                        His beneficence is infinite, and His excellences are permanent and everlasting.
                        (For further explanation, see E.N. 43 of AI-A`raf, E.N. 1.4 of Al-Mu'minun
                        E.N.'s 1 and 19 of Al-Furqan). <br>
                        <br>
                        2As the word al-Mulk has been used definitely, it cannot be taken in any limited
                        meaning. Inevitably it would imply sovereignty over everything that exists in
                        the Universe. "In Whose hand is the Kingdom' does not mean that He has physical
                        hands, but that He is possessor of all power and authority and no one else has
                        any share in it. <br>
                        <br>
                        3That is, He can do whatever He wills: nothing can frustrate or hinder Him from
                        doing what He pleases. <br>
                        <br>
                        4That is, the object of giving life to men in the world and causing their death
                        is to test them to see which of them is best in deeds. Allusion has been made in
                        this brief sentence to a number of truths:<br>
                        <br>
                        (1) That life and death are given by Allah; no one else can grant life nor cause
                        death;<br>
                        <br>
                        (2) that neither the life nor the death of a creation like man, which has been
                        given the power to do both good and evil, is purposeless; the Creator has
                        created him in the world for the test: life is for. him the period of the test
                        and death means that the time allotted for the test has come to an end;<br>
                        <br>
                        (3) that for the sake of this very test the Creator has given every man an
                        opportunity for action, so that he may do good or evil in the world and
                        practically show what kind of a man he is;<br>
                        <br>
                        (4) that the Creator alone will decide who has done good or evil; it is not for
                        us to propose a criterion for the good and the evil deeds but for Almighty
                        Allah; therefore, whoever desires to get through the test, will have to find out
                        what is the criterion of a good deed in His sight; the fifth point is contained
                        in the meaning of the test itself, that is, every person will be recompensed
                        according to his deeds, for if there was no reward or punishment the test would
                        be meaningless. <br>
                        <br>
                        5This has two meanings and both are implied here:<br>
                        <br>
                        (1),'That He is Almighty: in spite of being dominant over all His creatures, He
                        is Merciful and Forgiving for them, not tyrannous and cruel; and<br>
                        <br>
                        (2) that He has full power to punish the evildoers: no one can escape His
                        punishment; but He is forgiving for him who feels penitent, refrains from evil
                        and asks for His forgiveness. <br>
                        <br>
                        6For explanation, see E.N. 34 of AI-Baqarah, E.N 2 of Ar-Ra`d, E.N. 8 of Al-Hijr,
                        E.N. 113 of Al-Hajj, E.N. 15 of Al-Mu'minun, E.N. 5 of As-Saaffat, E.N. 90 of
                        Al-Mu'min.<br>
                        <br>
                        7Literally, tafawut is disproportion: two things being out of accord and
                        agreement with each other. So, the Divine words mean: "You will not see any
                        indiscipline, any disorder and discordance anywhere in the universe, there is
                        nothing disjointed and out of proportion in this world created by Allah: all its
                        parts are well connected and in perfect harmony and coordination. <br>
                        <br>
                        8The word futur means a crack, rift, fissure, or a thing's being split and
                        broken. The verse means to say that the whole universe is so closely well-knit
                        and everything in it, from a particle on the earth to the huge galaxies, so well
                        connected and coherent that the continuity of the system of the universe seems
                        to break nowhere, however hard one may try to probe and investigate. (For
                        further explanation, see E.N. 8 of Surah Qaf). <br>
                        <br>
                        9"The nearest heaven": the heaven the stars and planets of which can be seen
                        with the naked eye; the objects beyond that which can be seen only through
                        telescopes are the distant heaven; and the heavens still farther away are those
                        which have not yet been seen even with telescopes. <br>
                        <br>
                        10The word masabih in the original has been used as a common noun, and
                        therefore, automatically gives the meaning of the lamp's being splendid and
                        glorious. It means: "We have not created this universe dark, dismal and
                        desolate, but have decked and decorated it with stars, the glory and grandeur of
                        which at night strike man with amazement." <br>
                        <br>
                        11This does not mean that the stars themselves are pelted at the Satans, nor
                        that the meteorites shoot out only to drive away the Satans, but it means that
                        the countless meteorites which originate from the stars and wander in space at
                        tremendous speeds and which also fall to the earth in a continuous shower
                        prevent the Satans of the earth from ascending to the heavens. Even if they try
                        to ascend heavenward these meteorites drive them away. This thing has been
                        mentioned here because the Arabs believed about the soothsayers, and this also
                        was the claim made by the soothsayers themselves, that the Satans were under
                        their control, or that they had a close contact with them, and through them they
                        received news of the unseen, and thus, could foretell the destinies of the
                        people. That is why at several places in the Qur'an, it has been stated that
                        there is absolutely no possibility of the Satans' ascending to the heavens and
                        bringing news of the unseen. (For explanation, see E.N.'s 9-12 of AI-Hijr,
                        E.N.'s 6, 7 of As-Saaffat).<br>
                        <br>
                        As for the truth about meteorites, man's information in this regard is still
                        without a scientific basis. However, the theory which seems best to account for
                        all the facts known today and the information gathered from the examination of
                        the meteorites fallen on the earth, is that meteorites originate from the
                        disintegration of one or more planets and wander in space and sometimes fall to
                        the earth under its gravitational pull. (See Encyclopedia Britannica, vol. XV,
                        under "Meteorites"). <br>
                        <br>
                        12That is, the fate of all those,whether men or Satans, who disbelieve in their
                        Lord. (For the explanation of the meaning of disbelieving in the Lord (Rabb),
                        see E.N 161 of AI-Baqarah, E.N. 178 of An-Nisa', E.N. 39 of Al-Kahf, E,N. 3 of
                        Al-Mu'min <br>
                        <br>
                        13The word shahiq is used for producing a cry like the ass's braying. The
                        sentence may also mean that it could be the sound of Hell itself, as well as
                        that it would be the sound coming from Hell, where the people already flung into
                        it would be screaming and crying. This second meaning is supported by Surah Hud:
                        106, where it has been said: "Therein they will pant and hiss (because of
                        thirst)", and the first meaning is confirmed by Al-Furqan: 12, which says: "When
                        the Hell will see them from afar, they will hear the sounds of its raging and
                        roaring." On this basis, the correct meaning is that it would be the noise made
                        both by Hell and by the dwellers of Hell. <br>
                        <br>
                        14The real nature of this question will not be of a question that the keepers of
                        Hell would like to ask them whether a warner from Allah had come to them or not,
                        but the object would be to make them realize that no injustice had been done to
                        them by casting them into Hell. They would try to make them confess that Allah
                        had not kept them uninformed and unwarned: He had sent the Prophets to them; He
                        had informed them of the truth and of the Right Way; He had warned them that if
                        they followed a way other than the Right Way, it would lead them to Hell, in
                        which they had been cast. But they had not listened to the Prophets. Hence, they
                        rightly deserved the punishment which was being meted out to them at that time.<br>
                        <br>
                        This thing has been pointed out over and over again in the Qur'an that the test
                        for which Allah has sent man in the world is not being conducted by keeping man
                        absolutely unaware and uninformed of the requirements of the test only to see
                        whether he found the right way by himself or not; but Allah has made the most
                        appropriate arrangements that could possibly be trade of guiding him to the
                        Right Way, and it is that He has raised the Prophets and sent down the Books.
                        Now the test of man lies in this whether he accepts the Prophets and the Books
                        brought by them and adopts the straight way, or turns away from them to follow
                        his own desires, whites and speculations. Thus, the Prophethood, in fact, is
                        Allah's argument which He has established against man and on its acceptance or
                        rejection depends his whole future life. No one, after the appointment of the
                        Prophets, can present the excuse that he remained unaware of the Truth, or that
                        he has been caught and put to the hard test unawares, or that he is being
                        punished while he was innocent. This theme has been presented in countless
                        different ways in the Qur'an; for instance, see Al-Baqarah: 213, and E.N. 230 on
                        it; An-Nisa': 41-42, 165 and E N.'s 64 and 208; Al-An`am: 130-131, and E.N.'s
                        98-100; Bani Isra'il: 15 and E.N. 17; Ta Ha: 134; Al-Qasas 47, 59, 65 and E.N.'s
                        66, 83; Fatir: 37; AlMu'min: 50 and E.N. 66. <br>
                        <br>
                        15That is, "Not only you but the people who have believed in and followed you
                        also are misguided and lost in grave error."<br>
                        <br>
                        16"Had we only listened or understood": "Had we listened to the Prophets with
                        attention as seekers after Truth or used our intellect to understand what
                        actually was the message they were presenting before us." Here listening has
                        been given priority over understanding, the reason being that the pre-requisite
                        of obtaining guidance is to listen to what the Prophet teaches (or to read if it
                        is in the written form, like a seeker after Truth). To ponder over it in an
                        attempt to understand the truth is secondary. Without the Prophet's guidance man
                        cannot by himself reach the Truth directly by using his intellect and common
                        sense.<br>
                        <br>
                        17The word dhanb (sin) has been used in the singular. It means that the real sin
                        because of which they became worthy of Hell was to belie the Messengers and
                        refuse to obey them; all other sins are its consequences.<br>
                        <br>
                        18This is the real basis of morality in religion. A person's refraining from an
                        evil because it is an evil in his personal opinion, or because the world regards
                        it as an evil, or because its commission is likely to bring loss in the world,
                        or because it may entail a punishment by a worldly power, is a very flimsy basis
                        for morality. A man's personal opinion may be wrong, he may regard a good thing
                        as bad and a bad thing as good because of some philosophy of his own. In the
                        first place, the worldly standards of good and evil have never been the same:
                        they have been changing from time to time. No universal and eternal standard in
                        the moral philosophies is found today, nor has it ever been found before. The
                        fear of worldly loss also does not provide a firm foundation for morality. The
                        person who avoids an evil because he fears the loss that may result from it for
                        himself, cannot keep himself from committing it when there is no fear of
                        incurring such a loss. Likewise, the danger of the punishment by a worldly power
                        also is not something which can turn a person into a gentleman. Everybody knows
                        that no worldly power is knower of both the seen and the unseen. Many crimes can
                        be committed unseen and unobserved. Then, there are many possible devices by
                        which one can escape the punishment of every worldly power; and the Laws made by
                        a worldly power also do not cover all evils. Most evils are such as do not come
                        within the purview of the mundane laws, whereas they are even worse than the
                        evils which they regard as punishable. That is why, the Religion of Truth has
                        raised the edifice of morality on the basis that one should refrain from an evil
                        in fear of the unseen God Who sees man under all conditions, from Whose grasp
                        man cannot escape in any way, Who has given man an all-pervading, universal and
                        everlasting criterion of good and evil. To forsake evil and adopt good only out
                        of fear of Him is the real good which is commendable in religion. Apart from
                        this, if a man refrains from committing evil for .any other reason or adopts
                        acts which in view of their external form are regarded as good acts, his these
                        moral acts will not be worth any merit and value in the Hereafter, for they are
                        like a building which has been built on sand. <br>
                        <br>
                        19That is, there are two inevitable results of fearing God unseen:<br>
                        <br>
                        (1) That whatever errors and sins one will have committed because of human
                        weaknesses, will be forgiven provided these were not committed because of
                        fearlessness of God; and<br>
                        <br>
                        (2) that whatever good acts a man performs on the basis of this belief, he will
                        be rewarded richly for them.<br>
                        <br>
                        20The address is to all human beings, whether they are believers or unbelievers.
                        For the believer it contains the admonition that while living his life in the
                        world he should always remember that not only his open and hidden deeds but even
                        his secret intentions and innermost thoughts are not hidden from Allah; and for
                        the unbeliever the warning that he may do whatever he may please fearless of
                        God, but nothing that he does can remain un-noticed and unseen by Him.<br>
                        <br>
                        21Another translation can be: "Would He not know His own creatures?" In the
                        original man khalaqa has been used, which may mean: "Who has created" as well as
                        "whom He has created, " In both cases the meaning remains the same. This is the
                        argument for what has been said in the preceding sentence. That is, how is it
                        possible that the Creator should be unaware of His creation? The creation may
                        remain unaware of itself, but the Creator cannot be unaware of it. He has made
                        every vein of your body, every fiber of your heart and brain. You breathe
                        because He enables you to breathe, your limbs function because He enables them
                        to function, How then can anything of yours remain hidden from Him? <br>
                        <br>
                        22The word Latif as used in the original means the One Who works in
                        imperceptible ways as well as the One Who knows the hidden truths and realities.<br>
                        <br>
                        23That is, "This earth has not become subdued for you of its own accord, and the
                        provisions also that you are eating have not become available here by
                        themselves, but Allah has so arranged it by His wisdom and power that your life
                        became possible here and this splendid globe became so peaceful that you are
                        moving about on it with full peace of mind, and it has become such a vast table
                        spread with food that it contains endless and limitless provisions for your
                        sustenance. If you are not lost in heedlessness and look about yourself
                        intelligently you will find how much wisdom underlies the making of this earth
                        habitable for you and arranging in it immeasurable stores of provisions for
                        you." (For explanation, see E.N.'s 73, 74, 81 of Surah An-Naml, E.N.'s 29, 32 of
                        Ya Sin, E.N.'s 90, 91 of Al-Mu'min, E.N. 7 of Az-Zukhruf, E,N. 7 of Al-Jathiyah,
                        E,N. 18 of Surah Qaf.) <br>
                        <br>
                        24That is, "While you move about on the earth and eat of what Allah has.
                        provided for you here, you should not forget that ultimately you have to appear
                        before God one day." <br>
                        <br>
                        25This does trot mean that Allah lives in the heavens, but it has been so said
                        because man naturally looks up to the heaven whenever he wants to turn to Allah,
                        raises his hands heavenward in prayer and implores Allah turning his eyes up to
                        heaven whenever he finds himself helpless in an affliction. Then whenever a
                        calamity befalls him suddenly, he says it has descended from heaven; whenever
                        something unusual happens, he says it has come from heaven; and he calls the
                        Books revealed by Allah as heavenly Books. Accordingly to a tradition-in Abu
                        Da'ud, a person came before the Holy Prophet with a black slave-girl and said:
                        "It has become obligatory on me to set a slave free; can I set this slave-girl
                        free? Holy Prophet asked the slave-girl, "Where is Allah?" She pointed
                        heavenward with her forger. The Holy Prophet asked, "Who am I?" She first
                        pointed towards him and then towards the heaven, by which she obviously meant to
                        say: "You have come from Allah." Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: "Set her free;
                        she is a believer." (A story closely resembling this has been narrated in
                        Mu'watta, Muslim and Nasa'i also). About Hadrat Khawla bint Tha`Ibah.. Hadrat
                        'Umar once said to the people: "She is the lady whose complaint was heard above
                        the seven heavens" (In E.N. 2 of Surah al-Mujadalah, we have given full details
                        concerning this). All this clearly shows that it is natural with man that
                        whenever he thinks of God, his mind turns to the heaven above and not to the
                        earth below. In view of this very thing the words man fis-samaa. (He Who is in
                        the heaven) have been used about Allah. There is no room here for any doubt that
                        the Qur'an regards Allah Almighty as living in the heaven. In fact, there cannot
                        be any basis for this doubt, for in the very beginning of this Surah Al-Mulk, it
                        has been stated: "He Who created seven heavens, one above the other", and in Al-Baqarah
                        it has been said "You will face Allah in whatever direction you turn your face."
                        (v : 115) <br>
                        <br>
                        26The object is to impress this: " Your very survival and well-being on the
                        earth are at all tunes dependent upon Allah Almighty's grace and bounty: you are
                        not strutting about on this earth at will by your own power: you are under
                        obligation only to Allah's protection for each moment of your life that you are
                        passing here, otherwise Allah at any moment may cause such an earthquake to
                        occur as may make this very earth to become your grave instead of the cradle
                        that it is, or may cause a windstorm to blow razing all your towns and
                        settlements to the ground. " <br>
                        <br>
                        27"My warning": the warning that was being given through the Holy Prophet (upon
                        whom be peace) and the Qur'an to the disbelievers of Makkah to the effect: "If
                        you do not refrain from your disbelief and polytheism and do not accept the
                        message of Tauhid being given to you, you will be overtaken by the scourge of
                        God." <br>
                        <br>
                        28The allusion is to the communities who had belied the Messengers, who had come
                        to them previously and consequently been afflicted with Divine punishment.<br>
                        <br>
                        29That is, each bird that flies in the air, does so in the protection of the
                        All-Merciful God. He it is Who has given to each bird the form and structure by
                        which it became able to fly; He it is Who has taught each bird the method to
                        fly; He it is Who has made the air obey the laws by which it became possible for
                        the heavier than air bodies to fly in it; and He it is Who upholds every bird in
                        the air; otherwise the moment Allah withdraws His protection from it, it drops
                        to the ground. <br>
                        <br>
                        30That is, this is not confined only to birds, but whatever exists in the world,
                        exists because of Allah's keeping and guardianship. He alone provides the .
                        means necessary for the existence of everything, and He alone keeps watch that
                        everything created by Him is provided with the necessities of life. <br>
                        <br>
                        31Another translation can be: "Who is there beside the Merciful, who comes to
                        your rescue as your army?" The translation that we have adopted in the text
                        above has relevance to the following sentence, and this second to the preceding
                        discourse. <br>
                        <br>
                        32"Walking prone on his face": walking with face turned down like the cattle on
                        the same track on which someone put him. <br>
                        <br>
                        33That is, "Allah had made you men, not cattle. You were not meant to follow
                        blindly whatever error and deviation you found prevailing in the world, without
                        considering for a moment whether the way you had adopted was right or wrong. You
                        had not been given these ears that you may refuse to listen to the one who tries
                        to distinguish the right from the wrong for you, and may persist in whatever
                        false notions you already had in your mind; you had not been given these eyes
                        that you may follow others like the blind and may not bother to see whether the
                        signs scattered around you in the world testified to the Unity of God, which the
                        Messenger of God is preaching, or whether the system of the universe is Godless,
                        or is being run by many, gods simultaneously. Likewise, you had also not been
                        given this knowledge and intelligence that you may give up thinking and
                        understanding to others and may adopt every crooked way that was enforced by
                        somebody in the world, and may not use your own intellect to see whether it was
                        right or wrong. Allah had blessed you with knowledge and intelligence, sight and
                        hearing, so that you may recognize the truth, but you are being ungrateful to
                        Him in that you are employing these faculties for every other object than the
                        one for which these had been granted." (For further explanation, see E.N.'s 72,
                        73 of An Naml E.N.'s 75, 76 of Al-Mu'minun, E.N.'s 17, 18 of As-Sajdah, E.N. 31

                        34That is, "After being resurrected from death, you will be gathered together
                        from every corner of the earth and presented before Allah." <br>
                        <br>
                        35They did not ask this question in order to know the time and date of
                        Resurrection so that if they were told the Year, the month, the day and time of
                        its occurrence, they would accept it. But, in fact, they thought that
                        Resurrection was impossible, and its occurrence remote from reason, and they
                        asked this question in order to have an excuse for denying it. They meant to
                        say, "When will this strange story of Resurrection and gathering together, that
                        you are telling us, materialize? What for has it been put off? Why don't you
                        make it appear forthwith so that we are assured of it?" In this connection, one
                        should understand that one can be certain of Resurrection only by rational
                        arguments, and these have been elaborated at many places in the Qur'an. As for
                        the date of its occurrence only an ignorant person could raise such a question
                        about it, for even if it is told, it does not make any difference. The
                        unbeliever would say: "Well, when it does occur on the date you tell, I shall
                        then believe in it; how can I believe today that it will actually occur on that
                        very day?" (For further explanation, see E.N. 63 of Surah Luqman, E.N. 116 of
                        Al-Ahzab, E.N.'s 5, 48 of Saba' E.N. 45 of Ya Sin).<br>
                        <br>
                        36That is, "This I know that it will certainly come, and knowing this much only
                        is enough for warning the people before its actual occurrence. As for the
                        question when it will actually come, the knowledge of it is with Allah, not with
                        me, and there is no need of this knowledge for administering the warning. This
                        can be better understood by an example. As to the exact time when a person will
                        die, it is only known to Allah; however, all know that everyone has to die one
                        day. Our this knowledge is enough that we may warn a heedless friend of ours
                        that he should look after himself and his interests before death. For this
                        warning it is not necessary to know the exact day on which he will die. <br>
                        <br>
                        37That is, they will be in the same agony as is suffered by the criminal who is
                        being taken to the gallows.<br>
                        <br>
                        38When the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) started his mission in Makkah and
                        the members of the different clans of Quraish began to embrace Islam, the people
                        of every house started cursing him and his Companions. They started practicing
                        magic and charms on him to cause his death, even devising plots to kill him. At
                        this, it was said: "Say to them: what will it profit you whether we perish or we
                        live by the grace of God? You should worry for yourselves as to how you will
                        save yourselves from the punishment of Allah?" <br>
                        <br>
                        39That is, "We have believed in God, and you are denying Him; we have put our
                        trust in Him, and you have put your trust in yourself, your own resources and
                        false deities besides Allah; therefore, only we deserve to be shown mercy by
                        Allah, not you".<br>
                        <br>
                        40That is "Has another besides Allah the power to restore these springs of water
                        to you? If none else has this power, and you know fully well that none has it,
                        then who is worthy of worship: God or your false deities, who do not have the
                        power to restore them? Then ask your own selves as to who is misled and
                        misguided: those who believe in One God, or those who believe in many gods."<br>
