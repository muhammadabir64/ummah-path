                        <p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>This Surah is called Ad-Dahr as well as Al-Insan
                          after the words occurring in the first verse.<br><br><strong>Period of
                          Revelation</strong><br><br>Most of the commentators, including Allama
                          Zamakhshari, Imam Razi, Qadi, Baidawi, Allama Nizam ad-Din Nisaburi, Hafiz Ibn
                          Kathir and many others, regard it as a Makki Surah, and, according to Allama
                          Alusi, the same is the opinion of the majority of scholars. However, some
                          commentators hold the view that the Surah was revealed at Madinah, and some
                          others say that it was revealed at Makkah but vv. 8-10 of it were sent down at
                          Madinah.<br><br>As far as the subject matter and the style of the Surah are
                          concerned, these are very different from those of the Madani Surahs. A little
                          study of it rather shown that it is not only a Makki Surah but it was revealed
                          during the earliest period at Makkah, which began just after the revelation of
                          the first seven verses of Surah Al-Muddaththir. As for vv 8-10, they are so
                          naturally set in the theme of the Surah that if they are read in their proper
                          context, no one can say that the theme preceding and following them had been
                          sent down 15 to 16 years earlier but these three verses which were revealed many
                          years later were inserted here unnaturally.<br><br>In fact, the basis of the
                          idea that this Surah; or some verses of it were revealed at Madinah, is a
                          tradition which has related from Ibn Abbas (may Allah bless him). He says that
                          once Hadrat Hasan and Husain fell ill The Holy Prophet and some of his
                          Companions visited them. They wished Hadrat Ali to make a vow to Allah for the
                          recovery of the two children. Thereupon, Hadrat Ali, Hadrat Fatimah and Fiddah
                          their maid servant, vowed a fast of three days if Allah restored the children to
                          health. The children recovered by the grace of Allah and the three of them began
                          to fast as avowed. As there was nothing to eat in the house, Hadrat Ali borrowed
                          three measures (sa') of barley from somebody (according to another tradition,
                          earned through labor). When on the first day they sat down to eat after breaking
                          the fast, a poor man came and begged for food. They gave all their food to him,
                          drank water and retired to bed. The next day when they again sat down to eat
                          after breaking the fast, an orphan came and begged for something. They again
                          gave away the whole food to him, drank water and went to bed. On the third day
                          when they were just going to eat after breaking the fast, a captive came up and
                          begged for food likewise. Again the whole food was given away to him. On the
                          fourth day Hadrat Ali took both the children with him and went before the Holy
                          Prophet (upon whom be peace). The Holy Prophet (on whom be peace) seeing the
                          weak condition of the three, returned with them to the house of Hadrat Fatimah
                          and found her lying in a corner half dead with hunger. This moved him visibly.
                          In the meantime the Angel Gabriel (peace be on him) came and said; "Look, Allah
                          has congratulated you on the virtues of the people of your house!"When the Holy
                          Prophet asked what it was, he recited this whole Surah in response. (According
                          to Ibn Mahran's tradition, he recited it from verse 5 till the end. But the
                          tradition which Ibn Marduyah has related from Ibn Abbas only says that the verse
                          Wa yut'imun-at ta'am... was sent down concerning Hadrat Ali and Hadrat Fatimah;
                          there is no mention of this story in it). This whole story has been narrated by
                          Ali bin Ahmad al-Wahidi in his Commentary of the Qur'an, entitled Al'Basit, and
                          probably from the same it has been taken by Zamakhshari, Razi, Nisaburi and
                          others.<br><br>In the first place, this tradition is very weak as regards its
                          chain of transmission. Then, from the point of view of its subject matter also,
                          it is strange that when a poor man, or an orphan, or a captive, comes to beg for
                          food, he is given all the food. He could be given one member's food and the five
                          of them could share the rest of it among themselves:Then this also is incredible
                          that illustrious persons like Hadrat Ali and Hadrat Fatimah, who possessed
                          perfect knowledge of Islam, should have regarded it as an act of virtue to keep
                          the two children, who had just recovered their health and were still weak,
                          hungry for three consecutive days. Moreover, in respect of the captives also, it
                          has never been a practice under the Islamic government that they should be left
                          to beg for food for themselves. For if they were prisoners of the government,
                          the government itself was responsible to arrange food and clothing for them, and
                          if they were in an individual's custody, he was made responsible to feed and
                          clothe them. Therefore, it was not possible that in Madinah a captive should
                          have gone about begging food from door to door. However, overlooking the
                          weaknesses of transmission and the probability of subject matter, even if the
                          narrative is accepted as it goes, at the most what it shows is that when the
                          people of the Holy Prophet's house acted righteously as they did, Gabriel came
                          and gave him the good news that Allah had much appreciated their act of virtue,
                          for they had acted precisely in the righteous way that Allah had commanded in
                          these verses of Surah Ad-Dahr. This does not necessitate that these verses too
                          were sent down on that very occasion. The same is the case with many traditions
                          concerning the occasion of revelation. When about a certain verse it is said
                          that it was sent down on a particular occasion, it in fact does not mean that
                          the verse was sent down on the very occasion the incident took place. But it
                          means that the verse applies precisely and exactly to the incident. Imam Suyuti
                          in Al-Itqan has quoted this from Hafiz Ibn Taimiyyah: "When the reporters say
                          that a verse was sent down concerning a particular incident, it sometimes
                          implies that the same incident (or matter) occasioned its revelation, and
                          sometimes that the verse applies to the matter although it may not have
                          occasioned its revelation."Further on he quotes Imam Badr ad-Din Zarkashi's view
                          from his Al-Burhan fi Ulum al-Quran:"It is well known in respect of the
                          Companions and their immediate successors that when one of them says that a
                          verse was sent down concerning a particular matter, it means that the ruling
                          contained in it applied to that matter and not that the matter itself occasioned
                          the revelation of the verse. Thus, it only uses the ruling of the verse for the
                          purpose of reasoning and not for stating a fact." (Al-Itqan fi Ulum al-Quran,
                          vol. I, p. 31, Ed. 1929).<br><br><strong>Theme and Subject Matter</strong><br>
                          <br>The theme of this Surah is to inform man of his true position in the world
                          and to tell him that if he understood his true position rightly and adopted the
                          attitude of gratefulness, he would meet with such and such good end, and if he
                          adopted the way of disbelief, he would meet with such and such evil ends In the
                          longer Surahs of the Qur'an this same theme has been presented at length, but a
                          special characteristic of the style of the earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah is
                          that the subjects dealt with at length in the later period, "have been presented
                          in a brief but highly effective way in this period in such concise, elegant
                          sentences as may automatically be preserved in the memory of the hearers.<br>
                          <br>In this Surah, first of all man has been reminded that there was a time when
                          he was nothing; then a humble beginning of him was made with a mixed drop of
                          sperm and ovum of which even his mother was not aware; even she did not know
                          that he had been conceived nor anyone else seeing the microscopic cell could say
                          that it was a man, who in future would become the best of creation on the earth.
                          After this, man has been warned, so as to say: "Beginning your creation in this
                          way We have developed and shaped you into what you are today in order to test
                          and try you in the world. That is why, unlike other creatures, you were made
                          intelligent and sensible and were shown both the way of gratitude and the way of
                          ingratitude clearly so that you may show, in the interval that you have been
                          granted here for work, whether you have emerged as a grateful servant from the
                          test or an unbelieving, Un- grateful wretch!"<br><br>Then, just in one sentence,
                          it has been stated decisively what will be the fate to be met with in the
                          Hereafter by those who emerged as unbelievers from this test.<br><br>After this,
                          in vv. 5-22 continuously, the blessings with which those who do full justice to
                          servitude in the world, will be favored, have been mentioned in full detail. In
                          these verses, not only have their best rewards been mentioned but they have also
                          been told briefly what are the acts on the basis of which they would become
                          worthy of those rewards. Another special characteristic of the earliest Surahs
                          revealed at Makkah is that besides introducing in them briefly the fundamental
                          beliefs and concepts of Islam, here and there, those moral qualities and
                          virtuous acts have been mentioned, which are praiseworthy according to Islam,
                          and also those evils of deed and morality of which Islam strives to cleanse
                          human life. And these two things have not been mentioned with a view to show
                          what good or evil result is entailed by them in the transitory life of the
                          world, but they have been mentioned only to point out what enduring results they
                          will produce in the eternal and everlasting life of the Hereafter, irrespective
                          of whether an evil quality may prove useful or a good quality may prove harmful
                          in the world.<br><br>This is the subject matter of the first section (vv. 1-22).
                          In the second section, addressing the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), three
                          things have been stated: first, that "it is in fact We Ourself Who are revealing
                          this Qur'an piecemeal to you, and this is intended to inform the disbelievers,
                          not you, that the Qur'an is not being fabricated by Muhammad (upon whom be
                          Allah's peace and blessings) but it is "We Who are revealing it, and it is Our
                          Own wisdom which requires that We should reveal it piece by piece and not all at
                          once."Second, the Holy Prophet has been told: "No matter how long ,it may take
                          for the decree of your Lord to be enforced and no matter what afflictions may
                          befall you in the meantime, in any case you should continue to perform your
                          mission of Apostleship patiently, and not to yield to the pressure tactics of
                          any of these wicked and unbelieving people."The third thing he has been told is:
                          "Remember Allah day and night, perform the Prayer and spend your nights in the
                          worship of Allah, for it is these things which sustain and strengthen those who
                          call to Allah in the face of iniquity and disbelief."<br><br>Then in one single
                          sentence, the actual cause of the disbelievers wrong attitude has been stated:
                          they have forgotten the Hereafter and are enamored of the world. In the second
                          sentence, they have been warned to the effect: "You have not come into being by
                          yourself: We have created you. You have not made these broad chests, and strong,
                          sturdy hands and feet for yourselves, it is We Who made these for you; and it so
                          lies in Our power to treat you as We please. We can distort your figures, We can
                          destroy you and replace you by some other nation. We can cause you to die and
                          can recreate you in whatever form We like."<br><br>In conclusion, it has been
                          said: This is an Admonition: whoever wills may accept it and take a path to his
                          Lord. But man's own will and desire is not everything in the world. No one's
                          will and desire can be fulfilled unless Allah (also) so wills. And Allah's
                          willing is not haphazard: whatever He wills, He wills it on the basis of His
                          knowledge and wisdom. He admits into His mercy whomever He regards as worthy of
                          His mercy on the basis of His knowledge and wisdom, and He has prepared a
                        painful torment for those whom He finds unjust and wicked.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><br>1Most of the commentators and translators have taken hal in the first
                          sentence hal ata alal-insan-i, in the meaning of qad. Accordingly, they
                          interpret this sentence to mean; "No doubt, there has indeed passed on man a
                          time." But, in fact, the word hal in Arabic is used only as an interrogative
                          particle, and its object is not to ask a question in every case, but this
                          apparently interrogative particle is used in different meanings on different
                          occasions. For example, sometimes, in order to find out whether a certain
                          incident has taken place or not, we ask: "Has this thing happened?" Sometimes we
                          do not mean to ask a question but to deny something and we express the denial,
                          thus: "Can any other also do this?" Sometimes we want somebody to affirm
                          something and so ask him: "Have I paid what was due to you? And sometimes we do
                          not intend to have something just affirmed but we put a question in order to
                          make the addressee pay particular attention to something which follows his
                          affirmation as a sequel. For example, we ask someone: "Have I harmed you in any
                          way'?" The object is not only to make him affirm that one has not done him any
                          harm, but also to make him think how far one is justified to harm somebody who
                          has not harmed him in any way. The interrogative sentence in the verse before us
                          illustrates this last meaning. The object is not only to make man affirm that
                          there has indeed passed on him such a period of time but also to make him think
                          that the God Who developed and shaped him into a perfect man from an
                          insignificant, humble beginning, would not be helpless to create him once again.<br>
                          <br>In the second sentence, hin um-min ad-dahr the word dahr implies the endless
                          time, the beginning and end of which are unknown to man and here is the
                          particular period of tune which might at some time have passed during this
                          endless period. What is meant to be said is that in this immensely long span of
                          time there has passed a long period when human race was altogether non-existent.
                          Then a time came in it when a species called Man was created, and in the same
                          period a time has passed on every person when a beginning was made to bring him
                          into existence from nothingness.<br><br>The third sentence, "when he was not yet
                          a thing worthy of mention" implies that a part of him existed in the form of a
                          microscopic gene in the sperm drop of the father and a part in the form of a
                          microscopic ovum in the mother. For long ages man did not even know that he
                          comes into being when the sperm gene and the ovum combine. Now both have been
                          observed by means of powerful microscopes but even now no one can say how much
                          of man exists in the father's germ and how much in the mother's ovum. Then, the
                          initial cell that comes into being by the combination of the two at the time of
                          conception is such an insignificant thing that it can be seen only through
                          highly powerful microscopes and seeing it also no one at first sight can claim
                          that it is a man taking shape, nor that even if a man emerges from this humble
                          beginning, what will be his size and stature, what will be his form and figure,
                          and what will be his capabilities and personality like. This is the meaning of
                          the sentence that at that tithe he was not yet a thing worthy of any mention
                          although a beginning of his being as a man had been made.<br><br>2"From a mixed
                          sperm-drop": from the intermingling of the male sperm with the female ovum and
                          not separately from the sperm and the ovum. <br><br>3This shows man's real
                          position in the world and the position of the world for man. He is not like the
                          trees and animals that the object of his creation be fulfilled on the earth
                          itself, and he should die and perish here after he has played his appointed role
                          over a period of time according to the law of nature. Furthermore, this world is
                          neither a place of punishment for him, as the monks think, nor a place of
                          rewards as the believers of the law of transmigration think, nor a place of
                          entertainment and enjoyment, as the materialists think, nor a battlefield, as
                          the followers of Darwin and Marx think, but in fact it is a place of test and
                          trial for him. That which he regards as his age, is in fact the time given him
                          for the test. Whatever powers and capabilities he has been given in the world,
                          the thing, that have been placed under his control and authority, the various
                          positions and capacities in which he functions, and the relationships that he
                          enjoys with other men, all these are the countless papers of the test and this
                          test continues till the last breath of his life. The result is not to be
                          announced in this world but in the Hereafter when all his answer-books will have
                          been assessed, decision will be given whether he has come out successful or
                          failed. And his success or failure wholly depends on what he thought of himself
                          while he functioned here and how he answered the papers that were given him
                          here. If he believed that he had no God, or that he was the slave of many gods,
                          and while answering the papers thought that he was not to be held accountable
                          before his Creator in the Hereafter, his whole lifework went wrong. And if he
                          regarded himself as the slave of One God and worked in the way approved by God,
                          with the accountability of the Hereafter always in view, he stood successful in
                          the test. (This theme has occurred at many places in the Qur'an and has been
                          dealt with at length in the corresponding notes. It is not possible to give all
                          the references, but those who are interested in it may see the explanation of it
                          in its different aspects under "Test and Trial" in the Index. In no other book
                          beside the Qur'an has this truth been explained at such length ) . <br><br>4The
                          word sami' (hearing) and basir (seeing) in the original actually imply being
                          "sensible and intelligent". These words of the Arabic language are never used in
                          respect of the animal although it also hears-and sees. Thus, hearing and seeing
                          here do not imply the powers of hearing and seeing which have been given to the
                          animals too, but those means through which man obtains knowledge and then draws
                          conclusions from it. Besides, since hearing and seeing are among the most
                          important means of knowledge for man, only these two have been mentioned
                          briefly; otherwise it actually implies giving man all those senses of the body
                          by which he gathers information. Then the senses given to man are quite
                          different in their nature from those given to animals, for at the back of every
                          sense he has a thinking brain, which collects information gained through the
                          senses; arranges it, draws conclusions from it, forms opinions, and then takes
                          some decisions which become the basis of his attitude and conduct in life.
                          Hence, after saying, "We created man in order to try him," to say, "therefore,
                          We made him capable of hearing and seeing¦ actually contains the meaning that
                          Allah save him the faculties of knowledge and reason to enable him to take the
                          test. Obviously, if this were not the meaning and the meaning of making man
                          hearing and seeing just implied the one who could hear and see, then a blind and
                          deaf person would stand exempted from the test, whereas unless a person is
                          utterly devoid of knowledge and reason, there can be no question of his being
                          exempted from the test. <br><br>5That is, "We did not just leave him to himself
                          after giving him the powers of knowledge and reason, but We also guided him so
                          that he knows which is the path of gratefulness and which of ungratefulness, so
                          that whichever path he chooses in his later life, he himself is responsible for
                          it. In Surah Al-Balad, the same subject has been expressed, thus "And We showed
                          him both the conspicuous ways (of good and evil)." And in Surah Ash-Shams, thus
                          "By the human self, and by Him Who balanced it (with all the external and
                          internal powers), then inspired it with its wickedness and its piety " When all
                          these explanations are kept in view and also those detailed statements of the
                          Qur'an in which it has been stated what arrangements Allah has made for man's
                          guidance in the world, it becomes evident that in this verse "showing the way"
                          does not imply any one form of guidance but many forms of it which arc limitless
                          and countless. For example.<br><br>(1) Along with the faculties of knowledge and
                          reason man has also been endowed with a moral sense by which he discerns between
                          good and evil, regards some acts and qualities as evil even if he himself is
                          involved in them, and regards some other acts and qualities as good even if he
                          himself is avoiding them. So much so that even those people who for the
                          satisfaction of their selfish motives and desires have invented philosophies by
                          which they have justified many evils for themselves, protest loudly when they
                          are themselves treated with the same evils by others, and then it becomes known
                          that in spite of their false philosophies they actually regard them as evil.
                          Likewise, when a man himself is benefited by a good treatment from another
                          person, he is from within forced to commend and appreciate it even though he
                          might be looking upon good acts and qualities as ignorance folly and antiquated
                          things,<br><br>(2) In every man Allah has placed the faculty of Conscience (the
                          lawwamah), which checks and pricks him every time he is about to commit an evil,
                          or is in the process of committing it, or has already committed it. However hard
                          man may try to silence his Conscience or make it insensitive, he does not have
                          the power to destroy it completely. He may become shameless and prove himself to
                          be absolutely devoid of the Conscience, he may also try to deceive the world by
                          argumentation, he may even invent a thousand excuses to justify his acts in
                          order to deceive himself, but despite all this the censor that Allah has placed
                          in his nature is so active and powerful that it does not let remain hidden from
                          an evil person what he actually is. This same thing has been stated in Surah Al-Qiyamah,
                          thus: "Man knows his own self best even though he may offer many excuses." (v.
                          15)<br><br>(3) In man's own self and outside him, from the earth to the heavens,
                          there lie scattered in the universe countless such signs which clearly show that
                          all this could not happen without a God, nor could there be many gods to create
                          this life and control and administer it. Likewise, these very signs, inside man
                          and outside him, clearly point also to the Resurrection and Hereafter. If man
                          shuts down his eyes on them, or refuses to ponder over them intelligently, or
                          avoids to admit the truths which they point out, he himself would be to blame.
                          For Allah has shown no negligence in laying out every possible sign of the truth
                          for the guidance of man.<br><br>(4) Man does come across in his own life, and in
                          the contemporary world and in the experiences of past history, countless such
                          incidents which prove that a supreme power is ruling over him and the entire
                          universe before whom he is absolutely powerless, whose Will is dominant over
                          everything and whose help he needs at every moment. These experiences and
                          observations which point to the truth do not exist only outside him but in man's
                          own nature as well there exists the evidence of the existence of the supreme
                          power on the basis of which even the most confirmed atheist spreads out his
                          hands in prayer before God when in distress and the most hardened polytheist
                          abandons all false gods and starts invoking One God only for help.<br><br>(5)
                          Man's intellect and his nature assert positively that crime ought to be punished
                          and good deeds ought to be rewarded. On this very basis in every society of the
                          world a system of the courts is established in one form or another, and the
                          services and works, which are regarded as commendable are also rewarded in one
                          way or another. This is a clear proof of the fact that there is a necessary
                          relationship between morality and the law of retribution, which man cannot
                          possibly deny. Now, if it is admitted that in this world there are countless
                          such crimes which cannot be punished at all. to say nothing of punishing them
                          fully and adequately, and there are also countless such virtues, which cannot be
                          rewarded at all, to say nothing of rewarding them fully and adequately, there is
                          no alternative but to acknowledge the Hereafter, unless, of course, a foolish
                          person may assume, or a stubborn person may insist on having the opinion, that
                          man who has been endowed with the concept of justice, has taken birth in a world
                          which in itself is devoid of the concept of justice; and then it remains for him
                          to answer the question as to how and where from this man, who was born in such a
                          world, obtained this concept of justice.<br><br>To reinforce these means of
                          guidance Allah sent Messengers and revealed Books in the world for the purpose
                          of giving clear and definite guidance to man; in these Books it was clearly
                          explained what is the way of gratefulness and what is the way of ungratefulness
                          and unbelief and what will be the consequences of following either way. The
                          teaching brought by the Prophets and the Books has spread throughout the world
                          in countless perceptible. and imperceptible ways, on such a large scale that no
                          section of human population has remained unaware of the concept of God and the
                          Hereafter, of the distinction between good and evil, and of the moral principles
                          and legal rulings presented by them, whether it knows or does not know that it
                          has obtained this knowledge only through the teachings of the Prophets and the
                          Books they brought. Even those who disbelieve in the Prophets and the Books
                          today, or are unaware of them, also are following many of those things which
                          have reached them actually through their teachings while they do not know what
                          is the real source of these teachings.<br><br>6The word abrar as used in the
                          original implies the people who have done full justice to their Lord's
                          obedience, have carried out the duties enjoined by Him and abstained from the
                          things forbidden by Him.<br><br>7That is, it will not be camphor-mixed water but
                          a natural fountain, the purity, coolness and agreeable odor of whose water will
                          resemble camphor.<br><br>8Although the words 'ibad Allah (servants of Allah), or
                          `ibad ar-Rehman (servants of Rehman), can be used for all then literally, for
                          every human being is God's servant, yet wherever these words occur in the Qur'an
                          they only imply the righteous men. In other words, the wicked ones who have
                          excused themselves from Allah's servitude do not deserve that Allah should honor
                          them with the honorable title of ibad-Allah or ibad ar-Rehman, attributing them
                          to His own Holy Name. <br><br>9It does not mean that they will use spades and
                          shovels to dig out its channels and will take out its branches whither so ever
                          they please, but that their one single command and desire will be enough to
                          cause a fountain to gush forth from wherever they please in Paradise. <br><br>
                          10One meaning of fulfilling the vow is that one should fulfill, second, that one
                          should fulfill what one has pledged oneself to do, third, that one should
                          fulfill what one has been enjoined; what is obligatory for one to do, whether
                          one has been enjoined it, or is self-imposed. Of these three the second meaning
                          is the best known and generally the same is implied by fulfilling the vow. In
                          any case, these righteous people have been regarded as praiseworthy either
                          because they carry out the duties enjoined by Allah, or because if they vow to
                          Allah to perform certain good deeds which Allah has not enjoined on them, they
                          fulfill even those self imposed vows, not to speak of showing any negligence,in
                          carrying out the duties which Allah has actually enjoined on them.<br><br>As for
                          the commandments concerning the vow, we have explained these briefly in E.N. 310
                          of Surah Al-Baqarah above, But it would be useful to explain them at length here
                          so as to enable the people to avoid the errors and rid themselves of the
                          misunderstandings with regard to fulfilling the vow and learn the correct rules
                          pertaining to it.<br><br>(1) The jurists have mentioned four kinds of the vow:
                          (a) that one should pledge to Allah that one would perform such and such a good
                          act to earn His good pleasure; (b) that one should make a vow that one would
                          perform such and such a good act in gratitude to Allah if He fulfilled one's
                          such and such wish and desire. Both these kinds of the vow have been termed
                          nadhr tabarrur (i.e. vows for a good cause) by the jurists, and it is agreed by
                          all that it is obligatory to fulfill them. (c) That one should pledge to do an
                          unlawful thing or to refrain from an obligatory thing; (d) that one should bind
                          oneself to do a permissible thing, or to refrain from an obligatory thing, or
                          pledge to do an unworthy thing. These two kinds of the vow have been termed
                          nadhr lajaj (i.e. vow of ignorance, disputation and stubbornness) by the
                          jurists. About the third kind of the vow it is agreed that it does not take
                          place at all; and about the fourth kind the juristic opinion is divided. Some
                          jurists say that it should be fulfilled; some others say that one should expiate
                          the breaking of the oath, and still others that one has the option to fulfil the
                          vow or to expiate it. According to the Shaf is and the Malikis this vow does not
                          take place at all, and according w the Hanafis both these kinds of the vow
                          entail expiation. (`Umdat al-Qari)<br><br>(2) Several Ahadith show that the Holy
                          Prophet (upon whom be peace) has forbidden making a vow with a view to changing
                          the destiny, or with a view to making an offer to Allah that if He fulfilled
                          one's such and such wish, one would perform such and such good act, not in
                          gratitude to Allah, but in exchange for His ,help. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar
                          has reported that once the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) while he forbade
                          the making of a vow, said; "It cannot avert anything which is about to befall,
                          but through it something is extracted from the miserly person." (Muslim, Abu
                          Da'ud), The last sentence of the Hadith means: The miserly person is not prone
                          to spend anything in the cause of Allah; because of the vow he gives away
                          something in charity in the greed that Allah would accept his offer and change
                          his destiny for him. Another tradition from Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Umar is to the
                          effect; "The Holy Prophet said: the vow can neither hasten anything nor defer
                          anything, but through it something is extracted from the miserly person. "
                          (Bukhari, Muslim). In another tradition he says that the Holy Prophet forbade
                          making of the vow and said: "It does not bring any good, but it is a means
                          whereby something is extracted from the miserly person." (Bukhari, Muslim).
                          Several traditions on the same subject have been related by Muslim from Hadrat
                          Abu Hurairah, and in one tradition which both Bukhari and Muslim have related,
                          he reports that the Holy Prophet said: "As a matter of fact, the vow cannot
                          bring the son of Adam anything which Allah has not ordained for him, but the vow
                          sometimes coincides with the destiny itself and through it the Divine will takes
                          out from the possession of the miserly person that which he was not inclined to
                          give away willingly." This same theme is further explained by the tradition of
                          Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin `As according to which the Holy Prophet (upon whom
                          be peace) said: "True vow is that whereby Allah's goodwill and approval may be
                          sought. " ( Tahavi)<br><br>(3) Another rule that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
                          peace) gave concerning the vow is that only that vow should be fulfilled, which
                          is in obedience to Allah; the vow made in disobedience to Allah should never be
                          fulfilled. Likewise, there can be no vow concerning a thing which is not in
                          one's power to perform. Hadrat `A'ishah has reported that the Holy Prophet said:
                          "The one who made a vow that he would obey Allah, should obey Him, and the one
                          who made a vow that he would disobey Allah, should not disobey." (Bukhari, Abu
                          Da ud Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, lbn Majah, Tahavi). Thabit bin Dahhak says that the Holy
                          Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: "There can be no question of fulfilling a vow
                          made in the disobedience of Allah, nor in something which is not in one's
                          possession." (Abu Da'ud). Muslim has related a tradition on the same subject
                          from Hadrat `Imran bin Husain; and in Abu Da'ud a tradition has been reported in
                          greater detail from Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin `As, saying that the Holy
                          Prophet said: "No vow and no oath is of any use in an act which is not in the
                          power of man to perform, or which involves disobedience of Allah, or severance
                          of relations with kindred."<br><br>(4) One should not fulfill a vow which is
                          made to perform an act which is of no good in itself, which is useless, or
                          involves unbearable hardship or self-torture, and might have been self-imposed
                          as an act of virtue. In this connection, the sayings of the Holy Prophet (upon
                          whom be peace) are very clear and definite. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas says
                          that once when the Holy Prophet was giving a sermon, he saw a man who was
                          standing in the sun. He asked who he was and why he was standing in the sun. The
                          people said that he was Abu Isra'il: he had vowed that he would keep standing
                          and would not sit, nor take shade, nor speak to anybody, and would keep fast.
                          Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: "Tell him to speak, to come in the shade and
                          sit, but to observe the fast." (Bukhari, Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Mu'watta). Hadrat
                          `Uqbah bin `Amir Juhani says: "My sister vowed that she would go for Hajj
                          bare-foot and also vowed that she would not cover her head with a garment during
                          the journey. The Holy Prophet said: Tell her to go by a conveyance and to cover
                          'her head." (Abu Da'ud). Muslim has related several traditions on this subject
                          with a little variation in wording. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas reporting the
                          incident concerning `Uqbah bin `Amir's sister, has reported the Holy Prophet's
                          words to the effect: "Allah has no need of her vow: tell her to use a
                          conveyance." (Abu Da'ud). In another tradition Hadrat Ibn `Abbas says "A man
                          said: My sister has vowed to go and perform Hajj on foot. The Holy Prophet
                          replied: Allah has no need that your sister should undergo hardship. She should
                          go for Hajj by a conveyance." (Abu Da'ud). Hadrat Anas bin Malik has reported
                          that the Holy Prophet saw (probably during the Hajj journey) an old man being
                          supported between his two sons. When he asked what was the matter with him, it
                          was said that the old man had vowed to go on foot. Thereupon the Holy Prophet
                          said: "Allah is free from this that the man should place himself in agony. Then
                          he commanded him to ride." (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud. In Muslim another Hadith
                          on this very subject has been reported by Hadrat Abu Hurairah also).<br><br>(5)
                          If it is not practically possible to fulfill a vow, it may be fulfilled in some
                          other way. Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah says: "On the day of the conquest of
                          Makkah, a man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, I had vowed that if Allah
                          made Makkah fall at your hand, I would pray two rak ahs of the Prayer in Bait
                          al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). The Holy Prophet replied: Say the Prayer here. He again
                          asked the same thing and the Holy Prophet again gave the same reply. When he
                          asked it again, the Holy Prophet said: All right, as you please." According to
                          another tradition, the Holy Prophet said: "By Him Who has sent Muhammad (upon
                          whom be Allah's peace and blessings) with the truth, if you pray here it will
                          suffice for you instead of your praying at Bait al Maqdis (Abu Da'ud)."<br><br>
                          (6) The opinion among the jurists is divided concerning the person who vows to
                          give away all his possessions for the cause of Allah. Imam Malik says that he
                          should give away one-third of his possessions, and Sahnun from among the Malikis
                          has expressed the opinion that he should give away so much of his possessions as
                          does not subject him to hardship later. Imam Shafe`i says that if the vow is of
                          the nature of tabarrur(i.e. for a good cause), he should give away all his
                          possessions, and if it is of the nature of lajaj (i.e, a vow of ignorance), he
                          has the option to fulfill the vow or to expiate the oath. Imam Abu Hanifah says
                          that he should give away all such possessions as are subject to zalrat, but the
                          vow will not apply to those possessions which are exempt from zakat, e.g. house,
                          or other such properties. Imam Zufar from among the Hanafis is of the opinion
                          that he should give away everything in charity after he has taken out two
                          months' maintenance for his family. ( `Umdat al-Qari, Sharh Mu'watta by Shah
                          Waliyullah). Traditions of the Hadrat in this connection are as follows.<br><br>
                          Hadrat Ka'b bin Malik says: "When I was granted forgiveness for incurring
                          Allah's displeasure for staying behind on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk, I
                          went before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and submitted: My repentance
                          also included that I would give away all my possessions in charity for the sake
                          of Allah and His Messenger. The Holy Prophet replied: No, do not do that. I
                          said. Then half of the possessions? He said: No. I said: Then one-third of the
                          possessions? He replied: Yes." (Abu Da'ud). According to another tradition, the
                          Holy Prophet replied: "Withhold some of your possessions for yourself: this
                          would be better for you." (Bukhari), Imam Zuhri says: "Information has reached
                          me that Hadrat Abu Lubabah (who had similarly incurred displeasure in connection
                          with the same Battle of Tabuk) said to the Holy Prophet: "I shall give away all
                          my possessions for the sake of Allah and His Messenger in charity. The Holy
                          Prophet replied: For you it would be enough to give away only one-third of it."
                          (Mu'watta).<br><br>(7) Should a person who vowed to perform a good act before
                          embracing Islam, fulfil it after he has embraced Islam? The Holy Prophet's
                          ruling in this connection is that he should fulfil it. (Bukhari; according to a
                          tradition in Abu Da ud and Tahavi Hadrat `Umar is reported to have vowed in the
                          pre-Islamic days that he would observe i `tikaf(devotional seclusion) in the
                          Masjid al-Haram (for one night, or according to others, one day). After
                          embracing Islam when he asked for the Holy Prophet's ruling, he replied:
                          "Fulfill your vow." Some jurists have taken this ruling of the Holy Prophet to
                          mean that it is obligatory to do so, and some others that it is commendable.<br>
                          <br>(8) About the question whether the heirs are under obligation to fulfill a
                          vow made by the deceased person or not, the juristic opinion is divided. Imam
                          Ahmad, Ishaq bin Rahawaih, Abu Thaur and the Zahiris say that if the deceased
                          person had vowed to observe the Fast or perform the Prayer but could not fulfill
                          the vow, the heirs have to fulfill it. The Hanafis say that if the vow pertained
                          to a bodily worship (e.g. the Prayer or the Fast), the heirs are under no
                          obligation to fulfill it, and if it pertained to monetary worship and the
                          deceased did not leave any will for his heirs to fulfill it, they are again
                          under no obligation to fulfill it. but if he left a will, it will be obligatory
                          for the heirs to fulfill it from his inheritance up to one-third of its extent.
                          The Maliki viewpoint also is somewhat the same. The Shafe`is say that if the vow
                          pertains to a non-monetary worship, or if it pertains to a monetary worship and
                          the deceased person did not leave any inheritance, the heirs are under no
                          obligation to fulfill it; and if the deceased left some inheritance, the heirs
                          would be bound to fulfill the vow pertaining to a monetary worship, no matter
                          whether the dying person left a will or not. (Sharh Muslim by AI-Nawawi, Badhl
                          al-Majhud Sharh Abi Da ud). In the Hadith there is a tradition from Hadrat
                          `Abdullah bin `Abbas on this subject to the effect: "Hadrat Sa`d bin `Ubadah
                          asked for the Holy Prophet's verdict, saying: My mother has died and she had
                          made a vow which she could not fulfill. The Holy Prophet said: Fulfill the vow
                          on her behalf." (Abu Da'ud. Muslim). Another tradition from Ibn `Abbas is to the
                          effect: "A woman went on a sea journey and vowed that if she returned home safe
                          and sound, she would observe fast for a month. On her return home she died. Her
                          sister or her daughter came to the Holy Prophet to ask for his decision. The
                          Holy Prophet replied: "Observe the fast on her behalf." (Abu Da'ud Abu Da'ud has
                          related another tradition with the same content from Hadrat Buraidah, saying: "A
                          woman asked the Holy Prophet a similar thing and he gave the same reply as
                          mentioned above." Since these traditions are not explicit as to whether the
                          rulings the Holy Prophet gave pertained to its being obligatory or commendable,
                          and since about the vow made by Hadrat Sa`d bin `Ubadah's mother also it is not
                          clear whether it pertained to a monetary worship, or a bodily worship, there
                          have arisen differences among the jurists on this question.<br><br>(9) As for an
                          unlawful vow it is clear that it should not be fulfilled. However, there is a
                          difference of opinion as to whether it entails an expiation or not. On this
                          point since the traditions differ the juristic opinion is also divided.
                          According to one kind of the traditions the Holy Prophet commanded the person
                          concerned to make the expiation. Hadrat `A'ishah has reported that the Holy
                          Prophet said: "Three is no vow in the disobedience of Allah, and its expiation
                          is the expiation of breaking the oath" (Abu Da'ud, In the case of `Uqbah bin
                          `Amir Juhani's sister (mentioned under No. 4 above), the Holy Prophet (upon whom
                          be peace) commanded that she should break her vow and fast for three days.
                          (Muslim, Abu Da'ud). In the case of another woman also who had vowed to go for
                          Hajj on foot, he commanded that she should go by a conveyance and should make
                          expiation for the oath (Abu Da'ud). Ibn `Abbas has reported that the Holy
                          Prophet said: "The one who made a vow but did not specify what the vow was
                          about, should expiate for the oath, and the one who made a vow to perform a
                          sinful act, should expiate for the oath, and the one who made a vow to perform
                          something which he does not have the power to perform, should expiate for the
                          oath, and the one who made a vow to do something which he can do, should fulfill
                          it." (Abu Da'ud). On the other hand, there are the traditions which show that
                          there is no expiation in this case. The person under No.4 above had vowed that
                          he would stand in the sun and would not speak to anyone. Making a reference to
                          him in Mu'watta, Imam Malik writes: "I could not know by any means whether the
                          Holy Prophet besides commanding him to break the vow might also have told him to
                          make the expiation. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin `As has reported that the Holy
                          Prophet said: "If the one swearing an oath for something later finds that
                          another thing was better than that he should abandon it and should adopt the
                          better course and the abandonment itself is the expiation." (Abu Da'ud; Baihaqi
                          says that this Hadith and Hadrat Abu Hurairah's this tradition: "He should adopt
                          the better course and this is its expiation" are not established). Imam Nawawi
                          discussing these traditions of the Hadid in his commentary of Sahih Muslim
                          writes: "Imam Malik, Shafe`i, Abu Hanifah, Da'ud Zahiri and other scholars say
                          that the vow made to do a sinful thing is void and ineffectual and it does not
                          entail any expiation if not fulfilled, but Imam Ahmad says that it entails
                          expiation." <br><br>11Most of the commentators hold the view that the pronoun in
                          hubbi-hi refers to food. Accordingly, they interpret the sentence to mean: "In
                          spite of the food's being agreeable and tasty and that they need it, they give
                          it away to others." Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid say: "they do so because of their
                          fondness for feeding the poor ( `ala hubb-il-it am); and Fudail bin `Iyad and
                          Abu Suleman ad-Darani say: "They do so out of love for Allah." In our opinion
                          the following sentence ("We are feeding you only for the sake of Allah")
                          supports the last meaning. <br><br>12The custom in the ancient days was that the
                          prisoners were put in fetters and shackles and taken out daily to go about the
                          streets begging food. Later the Islamic government abolished this custom. (Imam
                          Abu Yusuf, Kitab al-Kharaj, p, 150, Ed, 1382 H. ) In this verse, the captive
                          implies every such person who is in bondage, whether he is an unbeliever, a
                          Muslim, a war prisoner, or imprisoned in consequence of a crime, and whether he
                          is provided food in that state, or made to beg for it. In any case, to feed a
                          helpless person who cannot do anything to earn a living, is an act of great
                          virtue.<br><br>13Although feeding a poor man is in itself a great virtue, yet
                          fulfilling the other needs of an indigent person is no less virtuous. For
                          example, to clothe a poor man, to arrange treatment for a sick person, or to
                          help a debtor who is harassed by his creditor, is an act of equally great
                          virtue. Here, a particular kind of virtue in view of its importance has been
                          presented only as an example, but the real object is to stress giving help to
                          the needy. <br><br>14It is not necessary that this may be said in so many words
                          while feeding the poor man. It may be said in the heart; in the sight of Allah
                          this is as meritorious as saying it with the tongue. But saying these words with
                          the tongue has been particularly mentioned so as to set the person being helped
                          at ease that no thanks or recompense is due from him, so that he eats with full
                          satisfaction and peace of mind. <br><br>15"Freshness and joy": freshness of the
                          face and joy of the heart. In other words, all the severities and terrors of the
                          Day of Resurrection will be meant only for the disbelievers and the culprits.
                          The righteous will on that Day remain immune from every hardship and will be
                          well-pleased with their lot. The same theme has been expressed in Al-Anbiya':
                          103, thus: "The time of great fright will not trouble them at all; the angels
                          will rush forth to receive them, saying: this is the Day that you were promised;
                          and in An-Naml: 89 thus: "He who brings good deeds, will have a reward better
                          than that, and such people shall be secure from the terror of that Day. " <br>
                          <br>16Here the word sabr (patience) has been used in a very comprehensive sense.
                          The whole worldly life of the righteous believers in fact has been described as
                          a life of patience. From the time a man attains discretion, or believes, till
                          death;' his suppressing of unlawful desires, adhering to the bounds set by
                          Allah, carrying out the duties enjoined by Him, sacrificing his time, his
                          wealth, his effort, powers and abilities, even his life if so required, ignoring
                          every greed and temptation, which might turn him away from Allah's way, meeting
                          every danger and enduring every hardship faced on the way of the truth, giving
                          up every gain and pleasure accruing from unlawful ways and means, bearing every
                          loss and suffering and affliction incurred on account of his love for truth, and
                          doing all this with full faith in the promise of Allah that He will bless the
                          doer with the fruits of this righteous conduct not in this world but in the
                          second life after death, turns the whole life of a believer into a life of
                          patience-eternal and perpetual patience. all-pervasive and life-long patience!

                          of Ha-Mim As-Sajdah, E.N. 53"of Ash-Shura). <br><br>17According to Az-Zukhruf:
                          71, vessels of gold shall be passed round to them, but here of silver. This
                          shows that vessels of gold as well as of silver shall be passed round to them as
                          required by the occasion. <br><br>18That is, though silver, it will be as
                          transparent as glass, Vessels of this kind of transparent, crystal like silver
                          will be the special characteristic of the vessels in which drinks will be served
                          to the people of Paradise. <br><br>19"In due measure": filled accurately
                          according to the desire of every person, neither over-filled nor under-filled.
                          In other words, the attendants of the dwellers of Paradise will be so judicious
                          and discerning that they will have accurate judgment about everybody whom they
                          serve wine as to how much of it he wishes to drink. (For the characteristics of
                          the wine of Paradise, see As-Saaffat: 45-47 and the E.N.'s 24 to 27, Muhammad:
                          15 and E.N. 22, At-'tur; 23 and E.N. 18, Al-Waqi`ah: 19 and E.N. 10). <br><br>
                          20This is to suit the taste of the Arabs who liked the wine flavored with
                          ginger-mixed water. But this flavoring will not be achieved by adding
                          ginger-mixed water to it: it will be a natural fountain which will have the
                          flavor of ginger but without its bitterness; Therefore, it will be called
                          Salsabil, which implies such water as flows gently and pleasantly down the
                          throat on account of its being sweet, light and palatable. Most commentators
                          think that the word salsabil has been used here as an adjective of the fountain
                          and not as a name for it. <br><br>21For explanation, see E.N. 26 of As-Saaffat,
                          E-N. 19 of At-Tur, E.N. 9 of Al-Wiiqi`ah.<br><br>22Even if a person might have
                          lived a pauper in the world, in the Hereafter when he is admitted to Paradise,
                          on the basis of his good deeds, he will live as though he were the owner of a
                          splendid kingdom. <br><br>23This same theme has been expressed in Surah Al-Kahf:
                          31, thus: "They (the dwellers of Paradise) will wear colored robes of silk and
                          rich brocade and will be reclining upon raised thrones.” On this basis, the
                          opinion of the commentators who have expressed the view that this implies the
                          sheets of cloth which will be hanging over their thrones or bedsteads or that
                          this would be the dress of the boys who would be moving about serving them does
                          not seem to be correct. <br><br>24In Surah Al-Kahf: 31, it has been said: "They
                          will be adorned with bracelets of gold. This same theme has also occurred in
                          Al-Hajj: 23 and Fatir 33 above. When all these verses are read together, three
                          possibilities become obvious,<br><br>(1) That sometimes they would 1ike to wear
                          bracelets of gold and sometimes bracelets of silver, both kinds of the ornaments
                          being available for use as and when required;<br><br>(2) that they will wear
                          bracelets of both gold and silver at the same time, for the combination of the
                          two enhances the personal charms of the wearer;<br><br>(3) that whosoever
                          desires will wear bracelets of gold and whosoever desires will wear bracelets of
                          silver.<br><br>As for the question, why will the men be adorned with the
                          ornaments when these are usually worn by the women? The answer is that in the
                          ancient times the custom was that the kings and their nobles used to adorn their
                          hands and necks and the crowns of their heads with different kinds of ornaments.
                          In Surah Az-Zukhruf it has been said that when the Prophet Moses arrived in the
                          Pharaoh's court in his simple dress, with only a staff in hand, and told him
                          that he was a Messenger sent by Allah, Lord of the worlds, the Pharaoh said to
                          his courtiers: "What kind of a messenger is he, who has appeared before me in
                          this state? If he was sent by the King of the universe, why were not bracelets
                          of gold sent down on him, or a company of angels as attendants?" (v. 53). <br>
                          <br>25Two kinds of the wine have been mentioned above, first that to which water
                          will be added from the fountain of camphor; second that to which water will be
                          added from the fountain of ginger, After these, making mention of another wine,
                          with the' remark that their Lord shall give them a pure wine to drink, gives the
                          meaning that this will be some superior kind of wine, which they will be given
                          to drink as a special favor from Allah. <br><br>26In the original, kana sa yu
                          kum mashkura: "your endeavors have been accepted and recognized." Sa`i implies
                          the entire lifework that a person accomplished in the world, the works and
                          objectives to which he applied his energies and abilities; and its being mashkur
                          means that Allah has appreciated it. Shukr when expressed by the servant to God
                          implies his gratefulness to Him for His blessings, and when it is expressed by
                          God for the servant, it means that He has appreciated his services. It is indeed
                          highly kind of the Master that He should appreciate the endeavors of the servant
                          when the servant has only carried out his duties according to the Master's will.<br>
                          <br>27Though the addressee here apparently is the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
                          peace), the discourse is directed to the disbelievers, who said "Muhammad (upon
                          whom be Allah's peace and blessings) himself composes the Qur'an deliberately
                          piece by piece; had it been from Allah, it would be revealed all at once. At
                          some places on the Qur'an this objection bas been cited and answered (e.g. see
                          E.N.'s 102, 104, 105, 106 of An-Nahl and E.N. 119 of Bani Isra'il), but here
                          Allah has answered it without citing it, saying emphatically: "It is We Ourself
                          Who are sending it down: it is not the composition of Muhammad: and it is We
                          Ourself Who are sending it gradually. That is, it is the requirement of Our
                          wisdom that We should not send down Our message all together in book form, but
                          should send it piece by piece." <br><br>28"Be patient": "Face patiently the
                          hardships and difficulties of the great Mission your Lord has entrusted to you:
                          endure firmly and steadfastly whatever comes to pass, without showing any
                          weakness in this regard." <br><br>29"Do not obey ...": "Do not yield to any one
                          of them so as to give up preaching of the true faith: do not be inclined to make
                          even the least change in the religious beliefs for the sake of any denier of the
                          Truth, or in the moral teachings for the sake of a wicked person. Proclaim
                          whatever is unlawful and forbidden to be so openly even if an immoral person
                          might press you hard to show some lenience in this condemnation, and proclaim
                          whatever is false as false and whatever is we as true publicly even if the
                          disbelievers might use all their influence to silence you, or to make you adopt
                          a little lenience in this regard." <br><br>30The rule followed in the Qur'an is
                          that wherever the Muslims have been exhorted to show patience against the
                          disbelievers, immediately after it they have been commanded to remember Allah
                          much and to observe the Prayer, which automatically implies that the power
                          needed to meet the resistance of the enemies of the Truth in the way of truth
                          faith can be obtained only by this means. To remember Allah morning and evening
                          may also imply remembering Allah always but when the command to remember Allah
                          at specific times is given, it implies the salat (Prayer). In this verse, bukrah
                          means the morning and asil the time from the sun's decline till sunset, which
                          obviously covers the Zuhr and the Asr times. Night starts after sunset;.
                          therefore, the command "to prostrate yourself in the night" would apply to both
                          the Maghrib and the `Isha' Prayers. Then, the command "to glorify Allah in the
                          long hours of night", clearly points to the time of the Tahajjud Prayer. (For
                          further explanation, see E.N.'s 92 to 97 of Bani Isra'il, E N. 2 of AI-Muzzammil).
                          This also shows that these very have been the Prayer times in Islam from the
                          beginning. However, the command making the Prayer obligatory five times a day
                          with fixed tunes and number of rakahs was given on the occasion of mi`raj
                          (ascension). <br><br>31That is, "The reason why the disbelieving Quraish still
                          persist in the errors and deviations of belief and morality and why they turn a
                          deaf ear to your invitation to the Truth is, in fact, their worship of the world
                          and their heedlessness of the Hereafter. Therefore, the way being followed by a
                          true God-worshiper is so different from and opposed to their way that there can
                          be no question of any compromise between them. " <br><br>32The sentence,
                          "Whenever it be Our will We can change their forms¦, can have several meanings:<br>
                          <br>(1) That whenever We please We can destroy them and replace them by other
                          people of their own kind, who will be different from them in conduct;<br><br>(2)
                          that whenever We please We can change their forms; that is, just as We can make
                          someone healthy and sound in body, so also We have the power to make somebody a
                          paralytic, cause someone to be struck with facial paralysis and other to fall a
                          victim to some disease or accident and become a cripple permanently; and<br><br>
                          (3) that whenever We will We can recreate them in some other form after death.<br>
                          <br>33Three things have been said in these verses:<br><br>(1) That whoever wills
                          may adopt the way to his Lord;<br><br>(2) that one's willing to do a thing is
                          not enough unless Allah so wills; and<br><br>(3) that Allah is All-Wise,
                          All-Knowing. If one considers these three things deeply one can fully well
                          understand the relationship between man's freedom of choice and Allah's Will,
                          and it helps to remove all the confusions from the people's minds about the
                          question of destiny.<br><br>The first verse shows that in this world the
                          authority granted to man is only to the extent that he may decide to adopt any
                          one of the different courses available for passing life here. This is the
                          freedom of choice that Allah has given him. For example, when a man confronts
                          the question of earning a living for himself, he finds many ways before him of
                          which some are lawful, as for example lawful kinds of labor, service, trade and
                          business, industry, or agriculture, and some are unlawful as thievery, robbery,
                          picking pockets, prostitution, trading in money (on interest), gambling, bribery
                          and unlawful kinds of services and business, etc. The decision to adopt any one
                          of these ways has been left to man's own free choice as to how he would like to
                          earn his living. Likewise, there are different modes of morality. On the one
                          side, there are the good qualities, like honesty, nobility, decency, justice,
                          pity, sympathy and chastity, and on the other, the evil traits like wickedness,
                          meanness, tyranny, dishonesty, and frivolity. Man has full freedom to adopt any
                          mode of morality he likes. The same is the case with religion; man has many ways
                          open before him in this regard also-atheism and denial of God, polytheism and
                          idol-worship, different combinations of monotheism and polytheism, and the
                          un-alloyed creed of God-worship which is taught by the Qur'an. In these also the
                          decision to choose has been left to man as to which of these he wants to adopt.
                          Allah does not impose on him any decision of His own so that man may like to
                          choose a lawful means of earning his living for himself but Allah may force him
                          to adopt an unlawful means for it. or that he may like to follow the Qur'an, but
                          Allah may force him to become an atheist, polytheist or disbeliever, or that he
                          may like to become a good man, but Allah may force him to become an evil man.<br>
                          <br>But after man has exercised this freedom of choice whether he can
                          practically also do the same which he wants to do, depends on Allah's Will, His
                          leave and His grace. If the Will of Allah be to let the man do what he has
                          willed or decided to do, then alone can he do it; otherwise he cannot do
                          anything without Allah's Will and His leave, however hard and seriously he may
                          try to do it. This same thing has been said in the second verse. This can be
                          explained by an example. If man had been delegated all the powers in the world
                          and permitted to do whatever he pleased, the system of the world would have been
                          disrupted. One murderer was enough to murder all the, people in the world if he
                          were given the freedom to kill anybody he liked. One pickpocket could pick the
                          pocket of everyone if he were given the option to pick anyone's pocket he
                          pleased. One thief was enough to steal whatever he liked; one adulterer to
                          commit rape on every woman, one robber to plunder every house, if each one of
                          these had full powers to act at he desired. Therefore, Allah has kept this in
                          His own power whether He may allow or disallow the man to follow the right or
                          the wrong path that he chooses to follow or not. The person who, giving up
                          error, wants to adopt the right way is also granted righteousness only by
                          Allah's leave and will. However, the condition is that the decision to give up
                          error and choose guidance should have been taken by the man himself; otherwise
                          just as Allah does not make anybody a thief or murderer or atheist or polytheist
                          forcibly, so also He does not make anybody a believer forcibly.<br><br>After
                          this, the third verse removes the misunderstanding whether Allah's willing may
                          not be arbitrary. That is why it has been said that "Allah is All-Knowing,
                          Al-Wise." That is whatever He does, He does it on the basis of knowledge and
                          wisdom; therefore, there can be no possibility of any error in His decisions. He
                          decided with full knowledge and wisdom as to who should be given a particular
                          kind of help and who should not be given it, who should be allowed to do a
                          particular work and who should not be allowed to do it. To the extent that Allah
                          provides opportunities to man and makes the conditions favorable for him, he can
                          work according to his desire, whether it be good or evil, The question of
                          guidance also is no exception to it. Allah alone knows on the basis of His
                          knowledge and He alone determines on the basis of His wisdom as to who deserves
                          to be guided and who does not. (Also see E.N. 41 of Al-Muddaththir <br><br>34In
                          this verse "wrong doers" imply the people whom the Revelations of Allah and the
                          teachings of His Prophet may reach, yet they deliberately and consciously decide
                          that they would not obey and follow them. This also includes those unjust people
                          who may plainly say that they do not accept the Revelation as God's Revelation
                          and the Prophet as God's Prophet, or that they do not believe in God at all, and
                          also those wicked people who may not refuse to believe in God and the Prophet
                          and the Qur'an, but they are resolved not to obey and follow them. As a matter
                          of fact, both these groups are unjust and wicked. As regards the first group,
                          their case is clear and obvious; but the second group is no less wicked: it is
                          also hypocritical and treacherous. Verbally they say that they believe in God
                          and the Messenger and the Qur'an, but in their hearts and minds they are
                          resolved not to follow them, and their practical conduct of life is also opposed
                          to it. About both Allah has declared that He has prepared for them a painful
                          torment. They might strut about in the world, enjoy life as they like, boast and
                          brag of their superiority, but ultimately they will be subjected to a
                          disgraceful punishment; they cannot enter and enjoy Allah's mercy in any way.
