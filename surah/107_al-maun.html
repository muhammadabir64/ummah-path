                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
                        <p>The words “have you seen”, apparently, are directed to the Prophet (peace be
                          upon him), but the Quranic style is that on such occasions it generally
                          addresses every intelligent and thinking person. And seeing means seeing with
                          the eyes, for what has been described in the succeeding verses can be seen by
                          every seer with his eyes, as well as knowing, understanding and considering
                          something deeply. If the word araaita is taken in the second meaning, the verse
                          would mean: Do you know the kind of man who belies the rewards and punishments.
                          Or: Have you considered the state of the person who belies the Judgment?<br><br>
                          The word ad-din as Quranic term is used for the rewards and punishments of the
                          Hereafter as well as for the religion of Islam. But the theme that follows is
                          more relevant to the first meaning, although the second meaning is also not out
                          of the context. Ibn Abbas has preferred the second meaning, while a majority of
                          the commentators have preferred the first. In case the first meaning is taken,
                          the theme of the Surah would mean that denial of the Hereafter produces such and
                          such a character in man. In case the second meaning is taken, the object of the
                          Surah would be to highlight the moral importance of Islam, to stress that Islam
                          aims at producing an altogether different character in its adherents from that
                          found in its deniers.<br><br>The style shows that the object of asking this
                          question at the outset is not to ask whether he has seen the person or not, but
                          to invite the listener to consider as to what kind of character is produced in
                          man when he denies the judgment of the Hereafter, and to urge him to know the
                          kind of the people who belie this creed so that he tries to understand the moral
                          significance of belief in the Hereafter.<br><br>The letter fa in the sentence
                          fa-dhalika-alladhi expresses the meaning of a whole sentence, which is to this
                          effect: If you do not know, then know that it is indeed he who drives away the
                          orphan. Or, it gives the meaning: Because of his this very denial of the
                          Hereafter he is the kind of man who drives away the orphan.<br><br>The sentence
                          yadu ul yatim as used in the original, has several meanings:<br><br>(1) That he
                          deprives the orphan of his rights and evicting him from his father’s heritage
                          thrusts him away.<br>(2) That if an orphan comes to ask him for help, he
                          repulses him instead of showing him any compassion, and if he still persists in
                          his entreaties in the hope for mercy, he drives him away and out of sight.<br>
                          (3) That he ill-treats the orphan.<br><br>For example, if in his own house there
                          is a closely related orphan, it is the orphans lot to serve the whole house, to
                          receive rebuffs and suffer humiliation for trivial things. Besides, this
                          sentence also contains the meaning that the person does not behave unjustly and
                          tyrannically only occasionally but this is his habit and settled practice. He
                          does not have the feeling that it is an evil which he must give up, but he
                          persists in it with full satisfaction, thinking that the orphan is a helpless,
                          powerless creature; therefore, there is no harm if his rights are taken away
                          wrongfully, or he is made the target of tyranny and injustice, or he is repulsed
                          and driven away whenever he asks for help.<br><br>In this connection, Qadi Abul
                          Hasan al-Mawardi has related a strange incident in his Aalam an-Nubuwwat. Abu
                          Jahl was the testator of an orphan. The child one day came to him in the
                          condition that he had no shred of a garment on his body and he implored him to
                          be given something out of his father’s heritage. But the cruel man paid no
                          attention to him and the poor child had to go back disappointed. The Quraish
                          chiefs said to him out of fun: Go to Muhammad (peace be upon him) and put your
                          complaint before him. He will recommend your case before Abu Jahl and get you
                          your property. The child not knowing any background of the nature of
                          relationship between Abu Jahl and the Prophet (peace be upon him) and not
                          understanding the motive of the mischief-mongers, went straight to the Prophet
                          (peace be upon him) and apprised him of his misfortune. The Prophet (peace be
                          upon him) immediately arose and accompanied the child to the house of Abu Jahl,
                          his bitterest enemy. Abu Jahl received him well and when the latter told him to
                          restore to the child his right, he yielded and brought out whatever he owed to
                          him. The Quraish chiefs were watching all this earnestly in the hope that an
                          interesting altercation would take place between them. But when they saw what
                          actually happened they were astounded and went to Abu Jahl and taunted him
                          saying that he too perhaps had abandoned his religion. He said: By God, I have
                          not abandoned my religion, but I so felt that on the right and left of Muhammad
                          (peace be upon him) there was a spear which would enter my body if I acted
                          against what he desired. This incident not only shows what was the attitude and
                          conduct of the principal chiefs of the most civilized and noble tribe of Arabia
                          towards the orphans and other helpless people in those days but it also shows
                          what sublime character the Prophet (peace be upon him) possessed and what impact
                          it had even on his bitterest enemies. A similar incident we have already related
                          in E.N. 5 of Surah Al-Anbiya, which points to the great moral superiority of the
                          Prophet (peace be upon him) because of which the disbelieving Quraish branded
                          him as a sorcerer.<br><br>La yahuddu means that the person neither persuades his
                          own self, nor tells the people of his household, to provide the poor man with
                          his food, nor does he urge others to recognize the rights of the poor and needy
                          people of society who are starving and do something to satisfy their hunger.<br>
                          <br>Here, by giving only two conspicuous examples, Allah has pointed out what
                          kind of evils are produced in the people who deny the Hereafter. The real object
                          is not to point out only these two evils that the people drive away the orphans
                          and do not urge giving away the food of the poor as a result of the denial of
                          the Hereafter. But of the countless evils which are thus produced, two evils
                          have been presented as an example, which every noble and sound-natured person
                          will regard as hateful. Besides, another thing meant to be impressed is that if
                          this very man had believed that he would have to go before God to render an
                          account of his deeds, he would not have committed such evils as to deprive the
                          orphan of his rights, tyrannize him, repulse him, neither feed the poor man
                          himself nor urge others to give him his food. The characteristics of the
                          believers in the Hereafter which have been described in Surah Al-Asr and Surah
                          Al-Balad are that they exhort one another to mercy, and they exhort one another
                          to the truth and to render the rights of others.<br><br>The words used are to
                          taam-il-miskin and not itam-ilmiskin. If itam-il-miskin were the words, the
                          meaning would be that he does not urge (others) to feed the poor. But taam
                          -il-miskin means that he does not urge (others) to give away the food of the
                          poor. In other words, the food that is given to the poor man is not the food of
                          the giver but of the poor man himself; it is his right which is enjoined on the
                          giver, and the giver is not doing him any favor but rendering him his right.
                          This same thing had been said in Surah Adh-Dhariyat: And in their possessions is
                          a due share of him who asks and of him who is needy. (verse 19).<br><br>The fa
                          in fa-wail-ul -lil-musallin signifies that such was the condition of the open
                          deniers of the Hereafter. One may then consider the condition of the hypocrites
                          who are included among the praying ones (i.e. Muslims). Since, despite being
                          Muslims they regard the Hereafter as a falsehood, one may note what path of ruin
                          they are following.<br><br>Though musallin means the praying ones, in view of
                          the context in which this word has been used and the characteristics of these
                          people that follow, this word, in fact, does not have the meaning of the praying
                          ones but of the people of salat, i.e. of those included among Muslims.<br><br>
                          The words used are an-salat-i him sahun and not fi salati- him ahun. In case the
                          words fi salat-i him had been used, the meaning would be that they forget in the
                          course of their Prayer. But forgetting in the course of the Prayer is no sin in
                          the eyes of the Shariah, nothing to say of its being hypocrisy, nor is it a
                          fault or anything blameworthy. The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself sometimes
                          forgot in the Prayer and to compensate for it he prescribed the method of sajdah
                          sahv. On the contrary, an salat-i-him sahun means that they are neglectful of
                          their Prayer. Whether they perform the Prayer, or do not perform it, it is of
                          little importance to them. They are not regular at the Prayers. When they
                          perform it, they do not observe the prescribed times, but offer it carelessly at
                          the eleventh hour. Or, when they rise up for the Prayer, they rise up and
                          perform it with an unwilling heart, as if it were a calamity imposed on them.
                          They play with their garments, yawn and betray absence of every trace of Allah’s
                          remembrance in their hearts. Throughout the Prayer they show no feeling at all
                          that they are performing the Prayer, nor of what they are reciting; their minds
                          wander and they perform articles of the Prayer without due attention; they
                          somehow perform a semblance of the Prayer and try to be rid of it as soon as
                          possible. And there are many people who would perform the Prayer only when they
                          must, otherwise the Prayer has no place in their lives. The Prayer time comes
                          but they show no concern that it is the Prayer time; they hear the call to the
                          Prayer but do not understand what the caller is calling to, whom he is calling
                          and for what purpose. These in fact are the signs of absence of faith in the
                          Hereafter. The claimants to Islam believe thus only because they do not believe
                          that they would be rewarded for performing the Prayer, nor have the faith that
                          they would be punished for not performing it. On this very basis, Anas bin Malik
                          and Ata bin Dinar say: Thanks to God that he said an salat-ihim and not fi
                          salat-i-him. That is, we do forget in the course of the Prayer but we are not
                          forgetful and neglectful of it; therefore, we shall not be counted among the
                          hypocrites.<br><br>The Quran at another place has described this state of the
                          hypocrites, thus: They come to offer their Prayer but reluctantly, and they
                          spend in the way of Allah with unwilling hearts. (Surah At-Taubah, Ayat 54). The
                          Messenger (peace be upon him) of Allah has said: This is the Prayer of the
                          hypocrite; this is the Prayer of the hypocrite; this is the Prayer of the
                          hypocrite! He watches the sun at the Asr time until when it reaches between the
                          two horns of Satan (i.e. when the time of sunset approaches), he gets up and
                          performs the Prayer carelessly, in which he remembers Allah but little.
                          (Bukhari, Muslim, Musnad Ahmad). Musab bin Saad has related from his father,
                          Saad bin Abi Waqqas: When I asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about the
                          people who are neglectful of their Prayer, he said: These are the people who
                          perform their Prayers when the prescribed time for it has passed. (Ibn Jarir,
                          Abu Yala, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn abi Hatim, Tabarani in Ausat; Ibn Marduyah,
                          Baihaqi in As-Sunan). This tradition has been related as a statement of Saad
                          himself also as a mauquf hadith and its sanad is stronger. Its being a marfu
                          narration of the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him) has been regarded as
                          weak by Baihaqi and Hakim). Another tradition from Musab is that he asked his
                          father: Have you considered this verse? Does it mean giving up the Prayer, or
                          wandering of one’s attention in the course of the Prayer, who among us has not
                          his attention divided. He replied: No, it implies wasting the prescribed time of
                          the Prayer and performing it when its time has elapsed. (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi
                          Shaibah, Abu Yala, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi in As-Sunan).<br><br>
                          Here, one should understand that coming of other thoughts in the mind in the
                          course of the Prayer is one thing and being unmindful of the Prayer and thinking
                          other things during it quite another. The first state is a natural human
                          weakness. Thoughts do interfere without intention, and as soon as a believer
                          feels that his attention is wandering from the Prayer, he gathers it and brings
                          it back to the Prayer. The other state is of being neglectful of the Prayer, for
                          in it man only goes through an exercise of the Prayer mechanically, he has no
                          intention of the remembrance of God in his heart. From the commencement of the
                          Prayer till its completion his heart is not turned towards God even for a
                          moment, and he remains engrossed in the thoughts with which he entered the
                          Prayer.<br><br>This can be an independent sentence as well as one relating to
                          the preceding sentence. In the first case, it would mean that they do not
                          perform any act of goodness with a pure intention for the sake of God, but
                          whatever they do, they do to be seen of others so that they are praised, are
                          considered righteous, their good act is publicized and its advantage and benefit
                          accrues to them here in the world. In the second case, the meaning would be that
                          they pray to be seen. The commentators generally have preferred the second
                          meaning, for at first sight it appears that it relates to the preceding
                          sentence. Ibn Abbas says: It implies the hypocrites who prayed to be seen. They
                          performed the Prayer if there was somebody to see them, but did not perform it
                          if there was nobody to see them. In another tradition his words are to the
                          effect: If they were alone they did not pray; but if there were others, they
                          prayed. (Ibn Jarir, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Abi Hatim , Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi , in
                          Ash-Shuab). In the Quran the hypocrites have been described thus: When they rise
                          up for the salat, they go reluctantly to it, merely to be seen of people and
                          they remember Allah but little. (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 142).<br><br>The word used
                          is maun. The view held by Ali, Ibn Umar, Saeed bin Jubair, Qatadah, Hasan Basri,
                          Muhammad bin Hanafiyyah, Dahhak, Ibn Zaid, Ikrimah, Mujahid, Ata and Zuhri is
                          that it implies the zakat while Ibn Abbas, Ibn Masud, Ibrahim Nakhai, Abu Malik
                          and many other scholars have expressed the opinion that it implies items of
                          common use; for example, cooking-pot, bucket, hatchet, balance, salt, water,
                          fire, flint (now its successor, the match-stick), etc. which the people
                          generally borrow from each other. A statement of Saeed bin Jubair and Mujahid
                          also supports it. Another view of Ali also is that it implies the zakat as well
                          as the little courtesies and kindnesses of daily life. Ibn Abi Hatim has related
                          from Ikrimah that maun of the highest form is zakat and of the lowest lending of
                          a sieve, bucket, or needle to a borrower. Abdullah bin Masud says: We, the
                          companions of Muhammad (peace be upon him), used to say, and according to other
                          traditions, in the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him), used to say that
                          maun implies lending of the cooking pot, hatchet, bucket, balance, and such
                          other things. (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Abu Daud, Nasai, Bazzar, Ibn
                          al-Mundhir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Tabarani in Al- Ausat, Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi in
                          As-Sunan). Saad bin Iyad without specifying any names has related almost the
                          same view from the companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), which shows
                          that he had heard this from several companions. (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Shaibah).
                          Dailami, Ibn Asakir, and Abu Nuaim have related a tradition from Abu Hurairah in
                          which he says that the Prophet (peace be upon him) explained this verse saying
                          that it implies the hatchet, bucket and other such things. If this tradition is
                          genuine, it probably did not come to the notice of other scholars; otherwise it
                          was not possible that other people should have given any other commentary of
                          this verse.<br><br>Maun in fact is a small, little thing useful to the people.
                          Accordingly, zakat also is maun, for it is a little amount out of much wealth,
                          which one has to give away in order to help the poor, and the other small items
                          of common use are also maun as mentioned by Abdullah Ibn Masud and the scholars
                          who share his viewpoint. The majority of the commentators say that maun applies
                          to all those small things which the neighbors usually ask each other for, and
                          asking for these is not in any way blameworthy, for the rich and the poor, all
                          stand in need of these at one time or another. However, to show stinginess in
                          lending these is regarded as mean behavior morally. Generally these things by
                          themselves last and the neighbor returns them in the original form after he has
                          used them. It would also be maun if a neighbor asks the other for a bed or
                          bedding items on the arrival of guests, or asks the neighbor’s permission to
                          have loaves baked in his oven, or wants to leave some valuables in the
                          neighbor’s custody when going out of his house for some days. Thus, the verse
                          means to impress that denial of the Hereafter renders a man so narrow-minded and
                          niggardly that he is not even prepared to make a most minor sacrifice for the
                        sake of others</p>
