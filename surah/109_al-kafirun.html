                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
                        <p>A few points in this verse are particularly noteworthy:<br><br>Although the
                          Prophet (peace be upon him) has been commanded to tell this to the disbelievers
                          plainly, the theme that follows makes it explicit that every believer should
                          tell the disbelievers plainly what has been said in the following verses; so
                          much so that the person who has just believed and repented of kufr is also bound
                          to express similarly his disgust with and disapproval of the creed and rites of
                          worship and gods of kufr. Thus, though the first addressee of the word qul (say)
                          is the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself, the command is not restricted to him
                          alone but it reaches every believer through him.<br><br>The word kafir is no
                          abuse, which might have been used for the addressees of this verse, but it
                          implies the one who refuses to believe or is an unbeliever. As against it the
                          word mumin is used for the believer. Therefore, the Prophet’s (peace be upon
                          him) saying, by Allah’s command, O disbelievers... in fact, means: O you, who
                          have refused to believe in my apostleship and in the teachings brought by me.
                          Likewise, when a believer uses this word, it will imply those who do not believe
                          in the Prophet Muhmmad (peace be upon him).<br><br>The word used is O kafirs and
                          not O mushriks; therefore, the addressees are not only the mushriks but all
                          those people who do not acknowledge Muhammad (peace be upon him) as Allah’s
                          Messenger and the teachings and guidance brought by him as the teaching and
                          guidance given by Allah Himself, whether they be Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians
                          or the disbelievers, polytheists and pagans of the entire world. There is no
                          reason why this address be restricted to the pagans of Quraish or of Arabia
                          only.<br><br>To address the deniers with the word O kafirs is just like
                          addressing certain people as O enemies, or O opponents. Such an address is not,
                          in fact, directed to the person of the addressee but it is made on the basis of
                          their characteristic of enmity and opposition, and lasts only until they are so
                          characterized. If one of them gives up enmity and opposition, or turns a friend
                          and supporter, he no longer remains the addressee of this word. Likewise, the
                          address of O kafirs to the people also is in view of their characteristic of
                          kufr and not their person. This address would be perpetual for him who continues
                          to be a kafir till death, but the one who believes will no longer be its
                          addressee.<br><br>Many scholars from among the commentators have expressed the
                          opinion that in this Surah the address of O disbelievers applied only to a few
                          persons of Quraish, who were visiting the Prophet (peace be upon him) with
                          proposals of compromise regarding religion and about whom Allah had informed His
                          Messenger (peace be upon him) that they would not believe. They have formed this
                          opinion for two reasons. First, that it is followed by La a budu ma ta budun: I
                          do not worship him or those whom you worship. They say that this does not apply
                          to the Jews and Christians, for they worship Allah. Second, that this is also
                          followed by: wala antum abiduna ma aabud: Nor are you worshippers of Him Whom I
                          worship. Their reasoning is that this statement does not apply to the people who
                          at the revelation of this Surah were disbelievers but later believed. Both these
                          arguments are incorrect. As for these verses, their explanation that follows
                          will show that they do not bear the meaning which has been understood from them.
                          Here, to point out the error of the reasoning it would be enough to say that if
                          the addressees of this Surah were only these people, why then does this Surah
                          still continue to be recited when they are dead and gone from the world long
                          long ago? And what was the need of making this Surah a part of the Quran
                          permanently so that the Muslims should continue to read it for ever afterwards?<br>
                          <br>This includes all those deities whom the disbelievers and the polytheists
                          have been, and are still, worshipping everywhere in the world, whether they are
                          the angels, the jinn, prophets, saints, spirits of the living or dead men, or
                          the sun, the moon, stars, animals, trees, rivers, idols and imaginary gods and
                          goddesses. One may say that the pagans of Arabia also acknowledged Allah as a
                          deity and the other pagans of the world also have never disacknowledged Allah as
                          a deity till today. As for the followers of the earlier scriptures, they also
                          acknowledge Allah alone as the real deity. How then can it be correct to
                          exonerate oneself from the worship of all the deities of all those people,
                          without exception, when Allah too is included among them?<br><br>The answer is
                          that if Allah is worshipped along with others regarding Him as a deity among
                          other deities, the believer in Tauhid will inevitably express his immunity from
                          this worship, for in his sight Allah is not a deity out of a collection of
                          deities, but He alone is the real deity, and the worship of the collection of
                          deities is no worship of Allah, although worship of Allah is also included in
                          it. The Quran has clearly stated that Allah’s worship is only that which does
                          not have any tinge of the worship of another and in which man makes his worship
                          exclusively Allah’s. And the only command they were given, was to worship Allah,
                          making their religion sincerely His, turning all their attention towards Him.
                          (Surah Al-Bayyinah, Ayat 5).<br><br>This subject has been explained at many
                          places in the Quran forcefully; for example, see Surah An-Nisa, Ayats 145-146;
                          Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 29; Surah Az-Zumar, Ayats 2, 3, 11, 14, 15; Surah Al-Mumin,
                          Ayat 14, 64-66. It has been further explained in a Hadith Qudsi (i.e. divine
                          word revealed through the mouth of the Prophet) in which the messenger of Allah
                          says: Allah says, I am Self-Sufficient of the association of every associate
                          most of all. Whoever performed an act in which he also associated another with
                          Me, I am free of it, and the entire act is for him who was associated. (Muslim,
                          Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Majah). Thus, acknowledging Allah as one of the two, three or
                          many gods and serving and worshipping others along with Him is, in fact, the
                          real kufr, declaration of immunity from which is the object of this Surah.<br>
                          <br>3. The words used are: ma abudu. The word ma in Arabic, is generally used
                          for lifeless or unintelligent things, and the word mun for intelligent and
                          rational beings. The question arises why has ma abudu been used here instead of
                          man abudu? The commentators generally give four answers to it:<br><br>(1) That
                          ma here is in the meaning of mun.<br>(2) That ma here is in the meaning of
                          alladhi (i.e. which or who).<br>(3) That in both the sentences ma is in the
                          meaning of a noun of action (masdar) and it means: I do not perform the kind of
                          worship that you perform, i.e. polytheistic worship, and you do not perform the
                          kind of worship that I perform, i.e. worship of One God.<br>(4) That since in
                          the first sentence ma tabuduna has been used, in the second ma abudu has been
                          used to keep the style; in both places there is only the uniformity of the word,
                          there is no uniformity of meaning; instances of this are found elsewhere also in
                          the Quran. For example, in Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 194, it has been said:
                          Therefore, if anyone transgresses a prohibition by attacking you, you may do
                          likewise. Obviously, to transgress likewise in retaliation is no transgression,
                          but the word transgression (in retaliation) has been used only for the sake of
                          uniformity in style. In Surah At-Taubah, Ayat 67, it has been said: They forgot
                          Allah, so Allah forgot them. Whereas Allah does not forget. What is meant to be
                          said is that Allah ignored them. The word nisyan in respect of Allah has been
                          used corresponding to their nisyan (forgetfulness) only to keep the uniformity
                          of the study.<br><br>Although all these four interpretations are correct in
                          their own way, and there is room in Arabic to take all these meanings, yet none
                          of these explains the real object for which ma abudu has been used instead of
                          mun abudu. As a matter of fact, when mun is used for a person in Arabic, it is
                          meant to say or ask something about his person, and when ma is used, it is meant
                          to ask or express something about his characteristics and traits. This can be
                          explained in English by the questions: who is he, and what is he, about a
                          person. When it is asked, who is he, the object is to know something about his
                          person. But when it is asked, what is he, the object is to know whether, for
                          example, he belongs to the army, and if so, what is his rank, or whether he
                          belongs to some teaching organization, and if so, whether he is a lecturer in
                          it, or a reader, or a professor, what science or art subject he teaches, what
                          are his qualifications, etc.<br><br>Thus, if in this verse, it was said: La
                          antum abiduna mun abud, it would mean: You are not worshippers of the being whom
                          I worship, and in response, the disbelievers and the polytheists could have said
                          that they too believed in the Being of Allah and also worshipped Him. But when
                          it was said: La antum abiduna ma abud, it meant: You are not worshippers of the
                          deity who has the attributes of the deity whom I worship.<br><br>And this is the
                          real point on the basis of which the religion of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be
                          upon him) is absolutely distinguished from the religions of all kinds of
                          disbelievers, besides the deniers of God, for his God is utterly different from
                          the God of all of them. The God of some of them is such that He stood in need of
                          rest on the seventh day after having created the world in six days, Who is not
                          God of the universe but God of Israel, Who stands in a special relationship to
                          the people of one particular race, which is not shared by other men, Who
                          wrestles with the Prophet Jacob and cannot throw him, Who has also a son, named
                          Ezra. The God of some others is father of an only son, called Jesus Christ, and
                          He causes His son to be crucified in order to make him an atonement for the sins
                          of others. The God of some has wife and children, but begets only daughters. The
                          God of some assumes human form and shape and living in a human body on the earth
                          works like men. The God of some is merely an Essence, or Cause of causes, or the
                          First Cause, Who after giving the system of the universe the initial push is
                          sitting aside unconcerned, the universe is working by itself according to some
                          relentless laws, and now He and man have nothing to do with each other. In
                          short, even the unbelievers who acknowledge God do not, in fact, acknowledge the
                          God, Who is the Creator, Master, Disposer, Administrator and Ruler of the entire
                          universe, Who has not only set the system of the universe but is running and
                          controlling it by Himself every moment, Who is above every defect, fault,
                          weakness and error, Who is free from every similitude, every physical
                          limitation, every likeness, Who is Self- Sufficient of every companion and
                          associate, Who has no partner in His Being, attributes, powers and entitlement
                          to worship, Who is far too Holy that He should have children, or should take
                          some one for a son, or should have an exclusive relationship with a community or
                          race, Who is directly related to each individual creature of His as its
                          Providence, Sustainer and Guardian, Who hears the prayers and answers them, Who
                          alone possesses all the powers to give life and death, to cause profit and loss,
                          and to make and mar destinies, Who not only sustains His creatures but also
                          guides each according to its nature and need, Who is not only our God Whom we
                          worship but also enjoins commands and prohibitions through His Prophets and His
                          Books, which we have to obey, before Whom we are accountable for our deeds, Who
                          will resurrect us after death, call us to account and reward and punish us
                          accordingly. No one in the world except for Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his
                          followers are worshipping the God with these attributes. If at all some others
                          also are worshipping God, they are not worshipping the real and true God but the
                          God who is their self-invented, imaginary God.<br><br>A section of the
                          commentators is of the view that both these sentences are a repetition of the
                          theme of the first two sentences and the repetition is meant to strengthen the
                          statement in the first two sentences. But many commentators do not regard it as
                          a repetition. They say that a new theme has been expressed in these which is
                          different from the theme of the first two sentences. In our opinion they are
                          correct in so far as there is no repetition in these sentences, for in these
                          only “nor are you worshippers of Him Whom I worship” has been repeated, and this
                          repetition also is not in the sense in which this sentence was used first. But
                          after negating the repetition the meanings that this section of the commentators
                          has given of these two sentences are very different from each other. There is no
                          occasion here to take up and discuss each of the meanings given by the
                          commentators. Avoiding details we shall only discuss the meaning which is
                          correct in our opinion.<br><br>In the first sentence, it has been said: “Nor am
                          I a worshipper of those whom you have worshipped.” Its theme is absolutely
                          different from the theme of verse 2, in which it was said: “I do not worship
                          those whom you warship,” These two things widely differ in two aspects. First,
                          that although there is denial, and a forceful denial, in saying that “I do not,
                          or shall not, do such and such a thing,” yet there is much greater force in
                          saying that “I am not a doer of such and such a thing,” for it means: “It is
                          such an evil thing that nothing to say of committing it; it is not possible that
                          I would even think of it, or have intention of doing it.” Second, that the
                          sentence “whom you worship” applies to only those gods whom the disbelievers are
                          worshipping now. On the contrary, the sentence “whom you have worshipped”
                          applies to all those gods whom the disbelievers and their forefathers have been
                          worshipping in the past. Now, it is a well known fact that the gods of the
                          polytheists and disbelievers have always been changing and their number
                          increasing and decreasing. In different ages different groups of them have been
                          worshipping different gods, and the gods of all the disbelievers have never
                          always been the same everywhere. Therefore, the verse means: I exonerate myself
                          not only from your gods of today but also from the gods of your forefathers, and
                          I am not a person who would even think of worshipping such gods.<br><br>As for
                          the second sentence, although its words in verse 5 are the same as in verse 3,
                          yet its meaning at the two places is different. In verse 3, it follows this
                          sentence: “I do not worship those whom you worship.” Therefore, it means: “Nor
                          are you worshippers of the God having the attributes of the One God Whom I
                          worship.” And in verse 5, it follows this sentence: “Nor am I a worshipper of
                          those whom you have worshipped.” Therefore, it means: “Nor does it seem you
                          would become worshippers of the One God Whom I worship.” Or, in other words, “It
                          is not possible that 1 should become a worshipper of each of those gods whom you
                          and your forefathers have worshipped, and on account of your aversion to
                          adopting worship of One God, instead of many gods, it cannot be expected that
                          you would desist from this wrong worship and will become worshipper of Him Whom
                          I worship.<br><br>That is, my religion is entirely distinct and separate from
                          your religion. I am not a worshipper of your gods and you are not worshippers of
                          my God. I cannot worship your gods and you are not prepared to worship my God,
                          Therefore, you and I can never follow and walk one and the same path together.
                          This is not a message of tolerance to the disbelievers, but a declaration of
                          immunity, disgust with and dissociation from them as long as they are
                          disbelievers. Its object is to disappoint them absolutely and finally that in
                          the matter of religion the party of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and
                          his followers would ever come to terms with them. This same declaration of
                          immunity and expression of disgust has been made in the Makki Surahs revealed
                          after this Surah successively.<br><br>Thus, in Surah Younus, it was said: If
                          these people deny you, say to them: 1 am responsible for my deeds and you are
                          responsible for yours: you are not accountable for what I do, and I am not
                          accountable for what you do. (verse 41). Then further on in the same Surah it
                          was said: O Prophet, say: O mankind, if you are still in doubt concerning my
                          faith, know that I do not worship those whom you worship beside Allah, but I
                          worship that Allah alone, Who has the power to cause your death. (verse 104).<br>
                          <br>In Surah Ash-Shuara it was said: If they disobey you, tell them: I am not
                          responsible for what you do. (verse 216).<br><br>In Surah Saba it was said: Say
                          to them: you will not be questioned for the errors we have committed, nor shall
                          we be answerable for what you are doing. Say, our Lord will gather us together,
                          then He will judge between us rightly. (verses 25-26).<br><br>In Surah az-Zumar:
                          Tell them plainly: O my people, do whatever you will, so shall I. Soon you shall
                          come to know as to whom comes the disgraceful torment and who gets the enduring
                          punishment. (verses 39- 40).<br><br>Then the same lesson was taught in
                          Al-Madinah to all the Muslims: There is indeed an excellent example for you in
                          Abraham and his companions when they said to their people plainly: We have
                          nothing to do with you and your gods, whom you worship beside God; we have
                          renounced you and there has arisen between us and you enmity and hatred for
                          ever, until you believe in Allah, the One. (Surah Al-Mumtahinah, Ayat 4).<br>
                          <br>These continuous explanations of the Quran do not leave any room whatever
                          for the doubt that the verse Lakum dinu kum wa liya din does not mean: You may
                          go on following your religion and allow me to follow mine, but it is the kind of
                          declaration made in Surah Az-Zumar, Ayat 14: O Prophet, say to them: I shall
                          serve Allah alone, making my religion sincerely His. As for you, you may serve
                          whomever you please beside Him. (verse 14).<br><br>From this verse lmam Abu
                          Hanifah and Imam Shafei have deduced that kufr (unbelief), as a whole, is one
                          community, however discordant and different from each other be the religions of
                          the unbelievers; therefore, a Jew can inherit a Christian, and a Christian a
                          Jew, and likewise the unbeliever of one religion can inherit the unbeliever of
                          another religion, if there exists between them a relationship by descent or
                          marriage, or some other connection, which necessitates the passage of
                          inheritance of one to another. On the contrary, Imam Malik, Imam Auzai and Imam
                          Ahmad hold the view that the followers of one religion cannot inherit the
                          followers of another religion. They deduce this from the Hadith which has been
                          related on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Amr bin alAas, saying that
                          Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: The people of two different
                          communities cannot inherit each other. (Musnad Ahmad, Abu Daud, Ibn Majah,
                          Daraqutni).<br><br>A Hadith with almost the same content has been related by
                          Tirmidhi from Jabir, by Ibn Hibban from Abdullah bin Umar, and by Bazzar from
                          Abu Hurairah. Dealing with this legal problem comprehensively, the well known
                          Hanafi Imam; Shamsul-Aimmah Sarakhsi, writes: The unbelievers can inherit each
                          other mutually for all those reasons for which the Muslims inherit each other
                          mutually, and they can also inherit each other in certain other cases in which
                          the Muslims do not inherit each other. The fact is that Allah recognizes only
                          two ways of life, the religion of truth and the religion of falsehood; that is
                          why He has declared: Lakum dinu-kum wa liya din. And He has classified the
                          people also into two groups, one group will go to Paradise and this consists of
                          the believers, and the second group will go to Hell and this consists of the
                          disbelievers collectively. And He has declared the two groups only as the
                          potential opponents of each other: These are the two parties who have disputed
                          about their Lord. (Surah Al-Hajj, Ayat 19).<br><br>That is, one group comprises
                          all the disbelievers collectively and they are opposed to the believers. We do
                          not admit that they are separate and distinct communities according to their
                          beliefs, but as against the Muslims they all form one community. For the Muslims
                          affirm faith in the apostleship of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and in the Quran
                          and they (disbelievers) refuse to affirm faith. For this very reason they have
                          been declared to be unbelievers and are one community as opposed to the Muslims.
                          The Hadith, La yata-warith ahl millatain, points to the same thing as explained
                          above. For the Prophet (peace be upon him) has explained the word millatain (two
                          communities) by his saying: La yarithul Muslim al-kafir wa lal-kafir al-Muslim:
                          The Muslim cannot inherit the disbeliever, nor the disbeliever can inherit the
                          Muslim. (AlMabsut vol. 30, pp. 30-32). The Hadith cited here by Imam Sarakhsi
                          has been related by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Abu
                        Daud on the authority of Usamah bin Zaid.<br><br></p>
