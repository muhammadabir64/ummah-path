                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
                        <p>As qul (say) is a part of the message which was conveyed to the Prophet
                          (peace be upon him) by revelation for preaching his prophetic message, its first
                          addressee is the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself but after him every
                          believer is also its addressee.<br><br>The act of seeking refuge necessarily
                          consists of three parts:<br><br>(1) The act of seeking refuge itself.<br><br>(2)
                          The seeker of refuge.<br><br>(3) He whose refuge is sought.<br><br>Seeking
                          refuge implies feeling fear of something and seeking protection of another, or
                          taking cover of it, or clinging to it, or going under its shelter for safety.
                          The seeker after refuge in any case is the person, who feels that he cannot by
                          himself resist and fight the thing that he fears, but stands in need of refuge
                          with another for protection. Then the one whose refuge is sought must
                          necessarily be a person or being about whom the seeker after refuge believes
                          that he or it alone can protect him from the calamity. Now, one kind of refuge
                          is that which is obtained according to natural laws in the physical world from a
                          perceptible material object or person or power, for example, taking shelter in a
                          fort for protection against the enemy’s attack, or taking cover in a trench or
                          behind a heap of earth, or wall, for protection against a shower of bullets, or
                          taking refuge with a man or government, for protection from a powerful tyrant or
                          taking refuge in the shade of a tree or building for protection from the sun.
                          Contrary to this, the other kind of refuge is that which is sought in a
                          supernatural Being from every kind of danger and every kind of material, moral
                          or spiritual harm and injury on the basis of the belief that that Being is ruler
                          over the physical world and can protect in supersensory ways the one who seeks
                          His refuge. This second kind of refuge is the one that is implied not only in
                          Surah Al-Falaq and Surah An-Nass but wherever in the Quran and the Hadith
                          mention has been made of seeking refuge with Allah, it implies this particular
                          kind of refuge, and it is a necessary corollary of the doctrine of Tauhid that
                          this kind of refuge should be sought from no one but Allah. The polytheists
                          sought this kind of protection, and seek even today, from other beings than
                          Allah, e.g. the jinn, or gods and goddesses. The materialists also turn for this
                          to material means and resources, for they do not believe in any supernatural
                          power. But the believer only turns to Allah and seeks refuge only with Him,
                          against all such calamities and misfortunes to ward off which he feels he has no
                          power.<br><br>For example, about the polytheists it has been said in the Quran:
                          And that from among men some people used to seek refuge with some people from
                          among the jinn (Surah Al-Jinn, Ayat 16).<br><br>And explaining it in E.N. 47 of
                          Surah Al-Jinn we have cited Abdullah bin Abbas’s tradition that when the
                          polytheistic Arabs had to pass a night in an uninhabited valley, they would call
                          out, saying: We seek refuge of the lord of this valley (i.e. of the jinn who is
                          ruler and master of this valley). Contrary to this, about Pharaoh it has been
                          said: When he witnessed the great signs presented by the Prophet Moses (peace be
                          upon him), he showed arrogance on account of his might. (Surah Adh- Dhariyat,
                          Ayat 39).<br><br>As for the attitude and conduct of the God-worshippers the
                          Quran says that they seek Allah’s refuge for protection against the evil of
                          everything that they fear, whether it is material or moral or spiritual. Thus,
                          about Mary it has been said that when God’s angel appeared before her suddenly
                          in human guise (when she did not know that he was an angel), she cried out: I
                          seek the merciful God’s refuge from you, if you are a pious man. (Surah Maryam,
                          Ayat 18).<br><br>When the Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) made an improper
                          petition to Allah, and was rebuked by Allah in response, he immediately
                          submitted: My Lord, I seek Your protection lest I should ask of You anything of
                          which I have no knowledge. (Surah Hud, Ayat 47) When the Prophet Moses (peace be
                          upon him) commanded the children of Israel to sacrifice a cow, and they said
                          that perhaps he was having a jest with them, he replied: I crave Allah’s
                          protection from behaving like ignorant people. (Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 67).<br>
                          <br>The same is the case with all the acts of seeking refuge which have been
                          reported in respect of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the books of Hadith.
                          For instance, consider the following prayers that the Prophet (peace be upon
                          him) made:<br><br>Aishah has reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used
                          to pray, saying: O God, I seek Your refuge from the evil of the works which I
                          did and from the evil of the works which I did not do. (i.e. if I have done a
                          wrong, I seek refuge from its evil results, and if I have not done a work which
                          I should have done, I seek refuge from the loss that I have incurred, or from
                          that I should do what I should not do). (Muslim).<br><br>Ibn Umar has reported
                          that one of the supplications of the Prophet (peace be upon him) was to the
                          effect: O God, I seek Your refuge from being deprived of a blessing that You
                          have bestowed on me and from being deprived of the well-being that You have
                          granted me and I seek refuge lest Your wrath should descend on me suddenly, and
                          I seek refuge from every kind of Your displeasure. (Muslim).<br><br>Zaid bin
                          Arqam has reported that the Messenger (peace be upon him) of Allah used to pray:
                          O God, I seek Your refuge from the knowledge which is not beneficial, from the
                          heart which does not fear You, from the soul which is never satisfied, and from
                          the prayer which is not answered. (Muslim).<br><br>Abu Hurairah has reported
                          that the Messenger (peace be upon him) used to pray: O God, I seek Your refuge
                          from hunger, for it is a most evil thing with which one may have to pass a
                          night, and I seek Your refuge from dishonesty, for it is sheer evil-mindedness.
                          (Abu Daud).<br><br>Anas has reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used
                          to pray: O God, I seek Your refuge from leprosy and madness and all evil
                          diseases. (Abu Daud).<br><br>Aishah has reported that the Prophet (peace be upon
                          him) used to pray in these words: O God, I seek Your refuge from the mischief of
                          the fire and from the evil of affluence and poverty. (Tirmidhi, Abu Daud).<br>
                          <br>Shakal bin Humaid requested the Prophet (peace be upon him) to teach him
                          some prayer. He told him to say: O God, I seek Your refuge from the evil of my
                          hearing, from the evil of my sight, from the evil of my tongue, from the evil of
                          my heart, and from the evil of my lust, (Tirmidhi, Abu Daud).<br><br>Atlas bin
                          Malik has reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say: O God, I
                          seek Your refuge from helplessness, indolence, cowardice, old age and
                          stinginess, and I seek Your refuge from the torment of the grave and from the
                          mischief of life and death, (and according to a tradition in Muslim also) from
                          the burden of debt and that the people should overpower me. (Bukhari, Muslim).<br>
                          <br>Khawla bint Hukaym Sulamiyyah says that she heard the Prophet (peace be upon
                          him) as saying that the one who halts at a new stage (during the journey) and
                          says: I seek refuge in the blameless words of Allah from the evil of the
                          creatures, will not be caused any harm until he departs from that stage.
                          (Muslim).<br><br>We have related these few prayers of the Prophet (peace be upon
                          him) from the Hadith, which show that the believer should seek Allah’s refuge
                          from every danger and evil and not the refuge of anyone else, nor he should
                          become self sufficient of Allah and place reliance only on himself.<br><br>The
                          word used in the original is Rabbil-Falaq. Falaq actually means to split and to
                          pierce through. A great majority of the commentators have taken it to mean
                          bringing out the light of dawn by splitting the darkness of night, for in Arabic
                          falaq-as-subh is often used for the breaking of dawn, and also in the Quran the
                          words Faliqul- isbah (He Who causes the dawn to appear by splitting the darkness
                          of night) have been used for Allah. (Surah AlAnaam, Ayat 96).<br><br>Another
                          meaning of falaq is also to create ot to bring into being, for everything
                          created in the world appears by splitting something. All vegetation sprouts by
                          splitting open the seed and the soil; all animals come out either from the womb
                          of mother or by breaking open the egg, or some other obstruction. All springs
                          gush out by splitting open the rock or soil. The day appears by piercing through
                          the curtain of the night. The drops of rain pierce through the clouds and fall
                          on the earth. In short, everything in the world comes into being as a result of
                          breaking and splitting another thing; so much so that the earth and the heavens
                          also in the beginning were one mass, then they were broken and parted. (Surah
                          Al-Anbiya, Ayat 30).<br><br>Thus, according to this meaning the word falaq is
                          common to all creations. Now, if the first meaning is adopted, the verse would
                          mean: I seek refuge with the Lord of rising dawn, and according to the second
                          meaning, it would mean: I seek refuge with the Lord of all creation. Here the
                          attribute of Rabb has been used for Allah instead of His proper Name, for
                          Allah’s attribute of being Rabb, i.e. Master, Sustainer and Provider, is more
                          relevant to seeking and taking of His refuge. Then, if Rabb-ul-falaq implies
                          Lord of the rising dawn, seeking His refuge would mean: I seek refuge with the
                          Lord Who brings out the bright daylight from the darkness of night so that He
                          may likewise bring well-being for me from all kinds of physical and psychical
                          dangers. If it is taken to mean Rabb al-khalaq the meaning would be: I seek
                          refuge with the Lord of all creation, so that He may protect me from the evil of
                          His creation.<br><br>In other words: I seek His refuge from the evil of all
                          creatures. A few things in this sentence deserve consideration.<br><br>First,
                          that the creation of evil has not been attributed to Allah, but the creation of
                          creatures has been attributed to Allah and of evil to the creatures. That is, it
                          has not been said: I seek refuge from the evils that Allah has created, but
                          that: I seek refuge from the evil of the things He has created. This shows that
                          Allah has not created any creature for the sake of evil, but all His work is for
                          the sake of good and a special purpose. However, from the qualities that He has
                          created in the creatures to fulfill the purpose of their creation, sometimes
                          evil appears from some kinds of creatures in most cases.<br><br>Second, that
                          even if this one sentence was given and no mention made of seeking Allah’s
                          refuge separately from the evils of some particular kinds of creatures in the
                          following sentences, this one sentence alone would have sufficed to express the
                          intent, for in it Allah’s refuge has been sought from the evil of all creatures.
                          After this general prayer for refuge making mention of seeking refuge from some
                          particular evils by itself gives this meaning: Though I seek Allah’s refuge from
                          the evil of everything created by Allah, I stand in great need of Allah’s refuge
                          from the particular evils that have been mentioned in the remaining verses of
                          Surah Al-Falaq and Surah An-Nass.<br><br>Third, that the most suitable and
                          effective prayer for seeking refuge from the evil of the creatures is that
                          refuge should be sought with their Creator, for He is in any case dominant over
                          His creatures and is aware of their evils, which we know, as well as of those
                          which we do not know. Hence, His refuge is the refuge of the supreme Ruler Whom
                          no power can fight and oppose, and with His refuge we can protect ourselves from
                          every evil of every creature, whether we are aware of it or not. Moreover, this
                          contains the prayer for refuge not only from the evils of the world but also
                          from every evil of the Hereafter.<br><br>Fourth, that the word sharr (evil) is
                          used for loss, injury, trouble and affliction as well as for the means which
                          cause losses and injuries and afflictions; for example, hunger, disease, injury
                          in accident or war, being burnt by fire, being stung or bitten by a scorpion or
                          snake, being involved in the grief of children’s death and similar other evils
                          which are evils in the first sense, for they are by themselves troubles and
                          afflictions. Contrary to this, unbelief, polytheism and every kind of sin and
                          wickedness, for instance, are evils in the second sense, for they cause loss and
                          affliction, although apparently they do not cause any trouble at the moment,
                          rather some sins give pleasure and bring profit. Thus, seeking refuge from evil
                          comprehends both these meanings.<br><br>Fifth, that seeking refuge from evil
                          also contains two other meanings. First, that man is praying to his God to
                          protect him from the evil that has already taken place; second, that man is
                          praying to his God to protect him from the evil that has not yet taken place.<br>
                          <br>After seeking Allah’s refuge generally from the evil of the creatures, now
                          prayer is being taught for seeking refuge from the evil of some special
                          creatures in particular. The word ghasiq in the verse literally means dark.
                          Thus, at another place in the Quran it has been said: Establish the salat from
                          the declining of the sun to the darkness of the night, ila-ghasaq-il-lail.
                          (Surah Bani lsrail, Ayat 78), and waqab means to enter or to overspread. Prayer
                          has been taught to seek refuge in particular from the evil of the darkness of
                          night, for most of the crimes and acts of wickedness are committed at night,
                          harmful animals also come out at night, and the night was a very dreadful thing
                          in the time chaos prevailed in Arabia when these verses were revealed. Raiders
                          came out in the dark of night and plundered and destroyed settlements. The
                          people who were thinking of putting the Prophet (peace be upon him) to death,
                          also made their secret plans at night, so that the murder could not be detected.
                          Therefore, command was given to seek Allah’s refuge from the evils and
                          calamities which descend at night. Here, the subtle relation that exists between
                          seeking refuge from the evil of the dark night with the Lord of breaking dawn
                          cannot remain hidden from anybody having insight and understanding.<br><br>A
                          difficulty is confronted in the explanation of this verse in view of several
                          authentic traditions. Aishah has reported: Once during a moon-lit night, the
                          Prophet (peace be upon him) took hold of my hand and pointing to the moon said:
                          Seek Allah’s refuge, for this is al ghasiq idha waqab. (Tirmidhi, Ahmad, Nasai,
                          lbn Jarir, Ibn al-Mundhir, Hakim, Ibn Marduyah). To explain this some scholars
                          said that idha waqab here means idha khasaf, i.e. when the moon is eclipsed. But
                          in no tradition has it been mentioned that when the Prophet (peace be upon him)
                          pointed to the moon, it was in eclipse. In the Arabic lexicon also idha waqab
                          cannot mean idha khasaf. In our opinion the correct explanation of this Hadith
                          is that since the moon rises in the night (in the daytime it does not shine even
                          if it is there in the sky), what the Prophet (peace be upon him) meant was this:
                          Seek God’s refuge from the night, the time when it (the moon) appears, for the
                          light of the moon is not as helpful for the one who resists as for the one who
                          attacks, and not as helpful for the victim of the crime as for the culprit. On
                          this very basis the Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: When
                          the sun has set, devils spread on every side. Therefore, gather your children
                          together in the house and keep your animals tied down until the darkness of
                          night disappears.<br><br>The word uqad in naffathat fil-uqad is plural of uqdah,
                          which means a knot that is tied on a string or piece of thread. Nafath means to
                          blow. Naffathat is plural of naffathah, which may mean the men who blow much,
                          and if taken as a feminine gender, women who blow much; it may as well relate to
                          nufus (human beings) or to jamaats (groups of men), for both nafas and jamaat
                          are grammatically feminine. Blowing upon knots, according to most, rather all,
                          commentators imply magic, for the magicians usually tie knots on a string or
                          thread and blow upon them as they do so. Thus, the verse means: I seek refuge
                          with the Lord of rising dawn from the evil of magicians, male and female. This
                          meaning is also supported by the traditions which show that when magic was
                          worked on the Prophet (peace be upon him), Gabriel had come and taught him to
                          recite the Muawwidhatayn, and in the Muawwidhatayn this is the only sentence
                          which relates directly to magic. Abu Muslim Isfahani and Zamakhshari have also
                          given another meaning of naffathat fil-uqad, which is that it implies the
                          deceitfulness of women and their influencing men’s resolutions, views and ideas
                          and this has been compared to a magic spell, for in the love of women man starts
                          behaving as if he was under a spell. Though this explanation is interesting, it
                          runs counter to the commentary given by the earlier scholars; and it also does
                          not correspond to the conditions in which the Muawwidhatayn were sent down as we
                          have shown in the Introduction.<br><br>About magic one should know that in it
                          since help is sought of the satans and evil spirits or stars to influence the
                          other person evilly, it has been called kufr (unbelief) in the Quran: Solomon
                          was not involved in kufr but the satans who taught magic to the people. (Surah
                          Al-Baqarah, Ayat 102).<br><br>But even if it does not contain any word of kufr,
                          or any polytheistic element, it is forbidden and unlawful and the Prophet (peace
                          be upon him) has counted it among the seven heinous sins which ruin the
                          Hereafter of man. In Bukhari and Muslim a tradition has been related from Abu
                          Hurairah, saying that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Avoid seven deadly
                          sins: associating another with Allah, magic, killing a soul unjustly which Allah
                          has forbidden, devouring interest, eating the orphan’s property, fleeing from
                          the enemy in the battlefield, and slandering simple and chaste Muslim women with
                          un-chastity.<br><br>Hasad means that a person should feel unhappy at the better
                          fortune, superiority or good quality that Allah has granted to another, and
                          should wish that it should be taken away from the other person and given to him,
                          or at least the other one should be deprived of it. However, hasad does not mean
                          that a person should wish that he too should be blessed with the bounty that the
                          other one has been blessed with. Here, Allah’s refuge has been sought from the
                          evil of the jealous one when he feels jealous, and takes a practical step with
                          word or deed to satisfy his heart. For until he takes a practical step, his
                          being unhappy may by itself be bad but it is not an evil for the other person so
                          that he may seek refuge from it. When such an evil appears from a jealous person
                          the best thing would be to seek Allah’s refuge from it. Besides this, there are
                          a few other things which are also helpful for obtaining immunity from the evil
                          of the jealous person. First, that one should have trust in Allah and the faith
                          that unless Allah so wills no one can harm him in any way. Second, that one
                          should have patience over what the jealous person says and does and should not
                          start behaving impatiently so as to be degraded morally to the level of the
                          jealous person. Third, that one should in any case maintain dignity and practice
                          piety even if the jealous person behaves frivolously, being fearless of God and
                          shameless of the people. Fourth, that one should free his mind of every thought
                          about the jealous person and should disregard him altogether, for making him a
                          subject of one’s thought is a prelude to being influenced by him. Fifth, that
                          one should do the jealous person a good turn as and when one can, not to speak
                          of treating him evilly, no matter whether this good behavior mitigates his
                          jealousy or not. Sixth, that one should understand rightly and remain steadfast
                          to the doctrine of Tauhid for the heart which enshrines Tauhid, cannot be
                        affected by anyone else’s fear except the fear of Allah.<br><br><br></p>
