                      <article>
                        <p><br><strong>Name</strong><br><br>The Surah has been so designated after the
                          word al-muzzammil occurring in the very first verse. This is only a name and not
                          a title of its subject matter.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br>
                          <br>The two sections of this Surah were revealed in two separate periods.<br>
                          <br>The first section (vv. 1-19) is unanimously a Makki Revelation, and this is
                          supported both by its subject matter and by the traditions of the Hadith. As for
                          the question, in which specific period of the life at Makkah it was revealed, it
                          is not answered by the tradition, but the internal evidence of the subject
                          matter of this section helps to determine the period of its revelation.<br><br>
                          First, in it the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been instructed to the
                          effect: "Arise during the night and worship Allah so that you may develop the
                          capability to shoulder the heavy burden of Prophethood and to discharge its
                          responsibilities." This shows that this Command must have been given in the
                          earliest period of the Prophethood when training was being imparted to the Holy
                          prophet by Allah for this office.<br><br>Secondly, a Command has been given in
                          it that the Qur'an be recited in, the Tahajjud Prayer for half the night, or
                          thereabout. This Command by itself points out that by that time at least so much
                          of the Qur'an had been revealed as could be recited for that long.<br><br>
                          Thirdly, in this section the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been exhorted
                          to have patience at the excesses being committed by his opponents, and the
                          disbelievers of Makkah have been threatened with the torment. This shows that
                          this section was revealed at a time when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
                          had openly started preaching Islam and the opposition to him at Makkah had grown
                          active and strong.<br><br>About the second section (v. 20) although many of the
                          commentators have expressed the opinion that this too was sent down at Makkah,
                          yet some other commentators regard it as a Madani Revelation, and this same
                          opinion is confirmed by the subject matter of this section. For it mentions
                          fighting in the way of Allah, and obviously, there could be no question of it at
                          Makkah; it also contains the Command to pay the obligatory zakat, and it is
                          fully confirmed that the zakat at a specific rate and with an exemption limit (nisab)
                          was enjoined at Madinah.<br><br><strong>Theme and Subject Matter</strong><br>
                          <br>In the first seven verses the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been
                          commanded to the effect: "Prepare yourself to shoulder the responsibilities of
                          the great Mission that has been entrusted to you; its practical form is that you
                          should rise during the hours of night and stand up in Prayer for half the night,
                          or for a little more or less of it."<br><br>In vv. 8-14, he has been exhorted to
                          the effect: "Devote yourself exclusively to that God Who is the Owner of the
                          whole universe. Entrust all your affairs to Him with full satisfaction of the
                          heart. Bear with patience whatever your opponents may utter against you. Do not
                          be intimate with them. Leave their affair to God: He Himself will deal with
                          them."<br><br>Then, in vv. 15-19, those of the people of Makkah, who were
                          opposing the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) have been warned, so as to say:
                          "We have sent a Messenger to you just as We sent a Messenger to the Pharaoh.
                          Just consider what fate the Pharaoh met when he did not accept the invitation of
                          the Messenger of Allah. Supposing that you are not punished by a torment in this
                          world, how will you save yourselves from the punishment for disbelief on the Day
                          of Resurrection."<br><br>This is the subject matter of the first section. The
                          second section, according to a tradition from Hadrat Sa'id bin Jubair, was sent
                          down ten years later, and in it the initial Command given in connection with the
                          Tahajjud Prayer, in the beginning of the first section, was curtailed. The new
                          Command enjoined, "Offer as much of the Tahajjud Prayer as you easily can, but
                          what the Muslims should particularly mind and attend to is the five times
                          obligatory Prayer a day:, they should establish it regularly and punctually;
                          they should discharge their zakat dues accurately; and they should spend their
                          wealth with sincere intentions for the sake of Allah. In conclusion, the Muslims
                          have been exhorted, saying: "Whatever good works you do in the world, will not
                          go waste, but they are like the provision which a traveler sends up in advance
                          to his permanent place of residence. Whatever good you send up from the world,
                          you will find it with Allah, and the provision thus sent up is much better than
                          what you will have to leave behind in the world, and with Allah you will also
                        get a much better and richer reward than what you have actually sent up before."</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><br>1To address the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) with these words and
                          then to command him to rise and keep standing in the Prayer at night, shows that
                          at the tune he either lay asleep, or had wrapped himself up in a sheet in order
                          to go to sleep. Here, to address him with "O you who sleeps covered up" instead
                          of with "O Prophet, or O Messenger", is a fine way of address, which by itself
                          gives the meaning: "Gone is the time when you used to enjoy peaceful sleep at
                          will; now you lie under the burden of a great mission, whose demands and duties
                          are different as well as onerous. <br><br>2This can have two meanings:<br><br>
                          (1) "Pass the night standing up in the Prayer and spend only a little of it in
                          sleep"; and<br><br>(2)"there is no demand from you to pass the whole night in
                          the Prayer, but have rest as well and spend a little part of the night in
                          worship too."<br><br>But in view of the theme that follows the first meaning
                          seems to be more relevant, and the same is supported by Ad-Dahr: 26, in which it
                          has been said: "Prostrate yourself before Him in the night and glorify Him
                          during the long hours of night." <br><br>3This is an explanation of the duration
                          of time commanded to be spent in worship. In it the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
                          peace) was given the option to spend half of the night in the Prayer, or a
                          little less than that, or a little more than that. But the style shows that half
                          the night has been regarded as preferable, for the measure is the same, which
                          may be decreased or increased, as the people may like and choose. <br><br>
                          4"Recite the Qur'an ......": Do not recite it quickly and in haste, but slowly
                          and distinctly: pause at every verse so that the mind understands the meaning
                          and purport of Divine Revelation well and takes effect from it. if it contains
                          the mention of Allah's Being and Attributes, it may awe-inspire the heart with
                          His glory and majesty; if it expresses His mercy, the heart may be filled with
                          feelings of gratitude to Him; if it mentions His wrath and His punishment, the
                          heart may be overwhelmed by fear of Him; if it enjoins something or forbids
                          something, one may understand what has been enjoined and what has been
                          forbidden. In short, the recital does not only consist in uttering the words
                          with the tongue, but it should involve thoughtful consideration of the meaning.
                          When Hadrat Anas was asked about the Holy Prophet's method of reciting the
                          Qur'an, he replied: The Holy Messenger stretched the words when reciting them.
                          For example, when he recited Bismillah ir-Rahman it-Rahim he would stretch and
                          prolong the sound of Allah, Rahman and Rahim (Bukhari). When Hadrat Umm Salamah
                          was asked the same question, she replied that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
                          peace) recited every verse separately and distinctly and observed a pause at the
                          end of every verse. For instance, he recited AI-hamdu-lillah-i Rabb-il'alamin,
                          and paused, then recited ar-Rahman ir-Rahim, and paused, and then recited
                          Malik-i yaum id-di'n. "(Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi). In another
                          tradition, Hadrat Umm Salamah has stated that the Holy Prophet recited each word
                          distinctly and clearly. (Tirmidhi, Nasa'i). Hadrat Hudhaifah bin Yaman says:
                          "Once I stood beside the Holy Prophet in the Night Prayer to see how he recited
                          the Qur'an. I noticed that he glorified Allah where He should be glorified,
                          invoked and supplicated Allah where He should be invoked and supplicated, and
                          sought refuge of Allah where His refuge should be sought." (Muslim, Nasa'i).
                          Hadrat Abu Dharr has stated that once during the Night Prayer when the Holy
                          Prophet (upon whom be peace) came to the sentence: In to adhdhib-hmn ... (If You
                          punish them, then they are Your servants; and if You forgive them, then You are
                          Almighty, All-Wise), he went on repeating it over and over again until it became
                          dawn." (Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari). <br><br>5That is, "You are being commanded to
                          stand up in the Night Prayer because We are going to send down on you a weighty
                          word, to bear the burden of which you must develop necessary power in yourself,
                          and you can develop this power only by abandoning your ease and comfort of the
                          night and by standing up in the Prayer and passing half the night or thereabout
                          in the worship of your Lord. "The Qur'an has been called a weighty Word also for
                          the reason that acting on its commands, demonstrating its teaching practically,
                          extending its invitation in the face of the whole world, and bringing about a
                          revolution in the entire system of belief and thought, morals and manners,
                          civilization and social life, according to it, is indeed the weightiest task any
                          human being ever has been charged with: It has been called a weighty Word also
                          because bearing the burden of its revelation was a difficult and heavy duty.
                          Hadrat Zaid bin Thabit says: "Once Revelation came down upon the Holy Prophet
                          (upon whom be peace) in a state when he was resting his head upon my knee. I
                          felt such a pressure of the weight on my knee that I thought it would break."
                          Hadrat `A`ishah says: "I have seen the state of the Holy Prophet's receiving
                          Revelation during intense cold, drops of perspiration started falling from his
                          forehead." (Bukhari, Muslim, Malik, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i): In another tradition
                          Hadrat `A`ishah has stated: "Whenever Revelation came down on the Holy Prophet
                          (upon whom be peace) while he was riding on his she-camel, the she-camel would
                          be forced to rest her chest on the ground and could not move until the
                          Revelation was over." (Musnad Ahmad. Hakim, Ibn Jarir). <br><br>6About the
                          meaning of the word nashi'at al-lail, as used in the original, the commentators
                          and lexicographers have expressed four different viewpoints:<br><br>(1) That
                          nashi'at implies the person himself who rises at night;<br><br>(2) that it
                          implies the hours of night;<br><br>(3) that it means the rising by night; and<br>
                          <br>(4) that it does not only apply to the rising in the night but rising after
                          having had some sleep,<br><br>Hadrat `A`ishah and Mujahid have adopted this
                          fourth viewpoint. <br><br>7The word ashaddu wat'an as used in the Text is so
                          vast in meaning that it cannot be explained in any one sentence. Its one meaning
                          is: As the rising for worship by night and standing up for a long tithe in the
                          Prayer is against human nature and the self of man seeks ease and comfort at
                          that time. this act is an exercise which is most effective in controlling and
                          disciplining the self. The person who governs himself by this method and gains
                          dominance over his body and mind becomes able to use his power in the way of
                          God, can work more efficiently and firmly to make the message of true Faith
                          prevail in the world. The second meaning is: This is a very effective means of
                          producing harmony and concord between the heart and the tongue, for during these
                          hours of the night none else intervenes between the servant and his God, and
                          whatever man utters with his tongue in this state, is the very voice of his
                          heart. The third meaning is: This is a very efficacious means of bringing about
                          conformity between the exterior and the interior of man, , for the person who in
                          the solitude of the night would abandon his comfort and ease and arise for
                          worship, would do so only out of sincerity: there can be no tinge of display and
                          hypocrisy in this. The fourth meaning is: As this worship is harder on man than
                          the worship of the daytime, it develops steadfastness in him: he is enabled to
                          walk in the path of God more firmly and can face and endure the hardships of
                          that way with greater constancy and determination. <br><br>8Literally: "Makes
                          the speech most upright and sound." But the purport is to say that at that time
                          man can read the Qur'an with greater peace of mind, attention and understanding.
                          lbn `Abbas has explained it thus: "That it is the most suitable time for man to
                          ponder over the Qur'an well.” (Abu Da'ud). <br><br>9After making mention of the
                          occupation of the daytime, the exhortation to "remember the name of your Lord"
                          by itself gives the meaning: "Never be heedless of the remembrance of your Lord
                          even when you are deeply involved in your worldly occupations, and continue. to
                          commemorate His name in one way or another at all times." (For explanation, see
                          E.N. 63 of Surah AI-Ahzab). <br><br>10" Wakil is a person in whom one has
                          complete faith; so much so that one can entrust all one's affairs to him with
                          full satisfaction of the heart. Thus, the verse means: "Do not feel distressed
                          at the hardships that you are experiencing at the storm of opposition that has
                          been provoked by your invitation to we Faith. Your Lord is He Who is the Owner
                          of the East and the West, (i.e. of the whole universe) besides Whom no one else
                          possesses the powers of Godhead. Entrust your affair to Him and be satisfied
                          that He will fight your case, He will deal with your opponents, and He will look
                          after all your interests well. " <br><br>11"Depart from them" does not mean
                          "Break off all ties with them and stop preaching to them", but it means; "Do not
                          have intimate and friendly relations with them: disregard their foolish behavior
                          and their nonsense." However, you should do so without showing any grief, anger
                          or temper but gracefully like a noble person, who would disregard the abusive
                          remarks of a mean person without minding them at all. This should not create the
                          misunderstanding that the Holy Prophet's conduct was any different from it;
                          therefore, Allah gave him this instruction. As a matter of fact, the Holy
                          Prophet (upon whom be peace) was already following this very mode of conduct;
                          this instruction was given in the Qur'an so as to tell the disbelievers: "It is
                          not due to any weakness on the part of the Prophet that he is not responding to
                          what you are saying against him, but Allah Himself has taught His Messenger to
                          adopt this noble way of conduct in response to your foolish behavior. " <br><br>
                          12These words clearly contain the sense that the people who were actually
                          denying the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in Makkah and were inciting the
                          common people to oppose and resist him by stirring up prejudices and by deceit
                          and fraud were the well-to-do, prosperous and affluent people, for it was their
                          interests, which were being hit by Islam's message of reform. The Qur'an tells
                          us that this was not peculiar only to the Holy Prophet's case but in every age
                          this very class of the people have been the main obstacle to every movement of
                          reform. For example, see Al-A`raf; 60, 6b, 75, 88; Al-Mu'minun: 33; Saba; 34 35;
                          Az-Zukhruf: 23. <br><br>13Heavy fetters in Hell will not be put on the
                          criminals' feet to stop them from escape but in order that they are not able to
                          stand up and move; these will not be used to prevent their escape but as an
                          instrument of their torment. <br><br>14Since at that time the cohesive force to
                          bind the parts of the mountains together will cease to work, first they will
                          become like crumbling dunes of fine sand, then because of the earthquake which
                          will be shaking the earth; the sand will scatter and shift and the whole earth
                          will turn into an empty level plain. This last state has been described in Ta
                          Ha: 105-107, thus: "They ask you: where will the mountains go on that Day? Say:
                          My Lord will reduce them to fine dust and scatter it away. He will turn the
                          earth into an empty level plain, wherein you will neither see any curve no
                          crease."<br><br>15The address now turns to the disbelievers of Makkah, who were
                          denying the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and persecuting him relentlessly.
                          <br><br>16Sending the Holy Prophet to be a witness over the people also means
                          that he should testify to the Truth by his word and deed before them in the
                          world and also that in the Hereafter when Allah's Court is established, he will
                          testify that he had presented the whole Truth before the people in the world.
                          (For further explanation, see E.N. 144 of Al-Baqarah, E.N. 64 of An-Nisa', An-Nahl:
                          84, 89, E.N. 82 of Al-Azab, E.N. 14 of Al-Fath). <br><br>17That is, "In the
                          first place, you should be afraid that if you do not accept the invitation of
                          the Messenger sent by Us, you will have to meet the same evil end in this world,
                          which the Pharaoh has already met in consequence of this very crime. But even if
                          no torment is sent on you in the world, how will you save yourselves from the
                          punishment of the Day of Resurrection?" <br><br>18About this verse in which
                          reduction has been made in the injunction concerning the Tahajjud Prayer, there
                          are different traditions. Musnad Ahmad, Muslim and Abu Da'ud have related a
                          tradition, on the authority of Hadrat `A'ishah, saying that this second command
                          was sent down one year after the first command, and the standing up in the
                          Prayer at night was made voluntary instead of obligatory. Another tradition
                          which Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim have related, again on the authority of Hadrat
                          `A'ishah, says that this command came down 8 months after the first command, and
                          a third tradition which Ibn Abi Hatim has related again from her, says that it
                          came down 16 months later. Abu Da'ud, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim have cited the
                          period of one year from Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas. But Hadrat Sa'id bin Jubair
                          has stated that it was sent down ten years later. (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim). In
                          our opinion this last view is most sound, for the subject-matter of the first
                          section clearly shows that it was sent down in Makkah and that too in the
                          earliest stage when at the most four years might have passed since the advent of
                          Prophethood. Contrary to this, this second section, .in view of the express
                          evidence of its subject matter, seems to have been revealed at Madinah when
                          fighting had started with the disbelievers and the zakat also had been enjoined
                          as an obligatory duty. On this basis inevitably the two sections should have
                          been sent down at an interval of at least ten years between them.<br><br>
                          19Although the initial command to the Holy Prophet was to keep standing up in
                          the Prayer for half the. night, or thereabout, it was difficult to compute the
                          time precisely in the absorption of the Prayer, especially when there were no
                          watches either to measure time accurately; therefore, sometimes two thirds of
                          the night passed in the prayer and sometimes only one-third of it. <br><br>20In
                          the initial command only the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was addressed and
                          only he was instructed to stand up in the Prayer by night. But since the Muslims
                          at that time were ardently desirous of following him in everything he did and of
                          earning more and more good and virtues, many of the Companions also performed
                          this Night Prayer regularly.<br><br>21As the Prayer is prolonged due mainly to a
                          lengthy recital of the Qur'an, it is said: "You may recite as much of the Qur'an
                          as you easily can in the Tahajjud Prayer This would automatically cause the
                          Prayer to be shortened" . Although the words here are apparently in the
                          imperative mood, it is agreed by all that Tahajjud is not an obligatory but a
                          voluntary Prayer. In the Hadith also it has been explained that on an inquiry by
                          a person the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) replied: "Five times Prayer in
                          the day and night is obligatory on you. He asked: Is anything besides this also
                          binding on me? The Holy Prophet said: No, unless you may like to offer something
                          of your own accord. " (Bukhari, Muslim).<br><br>This verse also shows another
                          thing. Just as the bowing (ruku ) and prostration (sajdah.) are obligatory in
                          the Prayer, so is the recital of the Qur'an. For just as Allah at other places
                          has used the words ruku' and sajdah for the prayer, so here He has mentioned
                          recital of the Qur'an, which implies its recital in the Prayer. If somebody
                          objects to this conclusion, saying: When the Tahajjud Prayer itself is
                          voluntary, how can recital of the Qur'an in it be obligatory? The answer is:
                          Even in case of the voluntary Prayer it is incumbent on one to fulfil all the
                          pre-requisites of the Prayer and to perform all its basic elements and
                          obligatory parts. No one can say that in case of the voluntary Prayer, purity of
                          the garments and body, ablutions and concealment of the satar (minimal part of
                          the body to be covered) are not obligatory, and the standing up and sitting and
                          performance of ruku`and sajdah also in it are only voluntary. <br><br>
                          22Traveling to earn one's living by lawful and permissible methods has been
                          described in many places in the Qur'an as the seeking of Allah's bounty. <br>
                          <br>23Here, the way Allah has made mention of seeking pure livelihood and
                          fighting in the Way of Allah together and declared these two, besides the
                          compulsion on account of illness, as reasons for exemption from the Tahajjud
                          Prayer, or concession in it, shows how meritorious it is in Islam-to earn one's
                          livelihood by lawful methods. In the Hadith, Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas`ud has
                          reported that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: "The person who came
                          to a city of the Muslims with food grains and sold it at the rate of the day,
                          will attain to a place nearest to Allah, and then the Holy Prophet recited this
                          very verse." (lbn Marduyah), Hadrat 'Umar once said: "Except for fighting in the
                          way of Allah, the state in which I would love to be overtaken by death, is the
                          state when I am overtaken by it while passing through a mountain pass in search
                          of livelihood and then he recited this very verse." (Baihaqi, Shu ab al-Iman).
                          <br><br>24Commentators are agreed that this implies observance of the obligatory
                          Prayer five times a day and giving away of the obligatory zakat.<br><br>25Ibn
                          Zaid says this implies spending one's wealth in the cause of Allah besides the
                          zakat, whether it is in the cause of fighting in the way of Allah, or for
                          helping the needy, or for public utilities, or other good works. The meaning of
                          giving to Allah a good loan has been explained at several places above. See E.N
                          267 of AI-Baqarah, E.N. 33 of Al-Ma'idah, E.N. 16 of Al-Hadid). <br><br>26It
                          means: "Whatever you have sent forward for the good of your Hereafter is more
                          beneficial for you than that you withheld in the world and did not spend in any
                          good cause for the pleasure of Allah. According to a Hadith reported by Hadrat
                          'Abdullah bin Mas`ud the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) once asked: "Which of
                          you has a greater love for his own wealth than for the wealth of his heir? The
                          people said: There is none among us, O Messenger of Allah, who would not have
                          greater love for his own wealth than for the wealth of his heir. He said:
                          Consider well what you are saying. The people submitted: This indeed is our
                          considered opinion, O Messenger of Allah. Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: Your
                          own property is only that which you have sent forward (for the good f your
                          Hereafter), and whatever you held back indeed belongs to the heir." (Bukhari.
                        Nasa'i, Musnad Abu Ya`la).</p>
