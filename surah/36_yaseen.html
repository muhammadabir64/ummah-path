Behold!, there came messengers to it.</li><li class="collection-item"> When We (first) sent to them two messengers, they rejected them: But We strengthened them with a third: they said, "Truly, we have been sent on a mission to you."</li><li class="collection-item"> The (people) said: "Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious sends no sort of revelation: ye do nothing but lie."</li><li class="collection-item"> They said: "Our Lord doth know that we have been sent on a mission to you:</li><li class="collection-item"> "And our duty is only to proclaim the clear Message."</li><li class="collection-item"> The (people) said: "for us, we augur an evil omen from you: if ye desist not, we will certainly stone you.

Nay, but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Then there came running, from the farthest part of the City, a man, saying, "O my people!

                      <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
<p>Ibn Abbas, Ikrimah, Dahhak, Hasan Basri and Sufyan bin Uyainah have opined 
that it means, “O man”, or “O person”. Some other commentators have regarded it 
as an abbreviation of “Ya Sayyid” as well, which, according to this 
interpretation, would be an address to the Prophet (peace be upon him).<br><br>
To begin a discourse like this does not mean that the Prophet (peace be upon 
him), God forbid, had some doubt about his Prophethood, and Allah had to say 
this in order to reassure him of it. But the reason is that the disbelieving 
Quraish at that time were most vehemently refusing to believe in his 
Prophethood. Therefore, Allah at the very beginning of the discourse has said: 
You are indeed one of the Messengers, which implies that the people who deny 
your Prophethood are misled and mistaken. To further confirm the same, an oath 
has been taken by the Quran and the word “wise” has been used as an epithet of 
the Quran, which means this: An obvious proof of your being a Prophet is this 
Quran, which is full of wisdom. This itself testifies that the person who is 
presenting such wise revelations is most surely a Messenger of God. No man has 
the power to compose such revelations. The people who know Muhammad (peace be 
upon him) can never be involved in the misunderstanding that he is himself 
forging these discourses, or reciting them after having learned them from 
another man. For further explanation, see Surah Yunus, Ayats 16-17, 37-39; Surah 
Bani-Israil, Ayat 88; Surah An-Naml, Ayat 75; Surah Al-Qasas, Ayats 44-46, 
85-87; Surah Al-Ankabut, Ayats 49-51; Surah Ar-Rum, Ayats 1-5 and the relevant 
E.Ns.<br><br>Here, two of the attributes of the Sender of the Quran have been 
mentioned. First, that He is All-Mighty; second, that He, is All-Merciful. The 
first attribute is meant to impress the reality that the Quran is not the 
counsel of a powerless preacher, which if you overlook or ignore, will not bring 
any harm to you; but this is the Edict of that Owner of the Universe, Who is 
All-Mighty, Whose decrees cannot be withheld from being enforced by any power, 
and Whose grasp cannot be avoided by anyone. The second attribute is meant to 
make one realize that it is all due to His kindness and mercy that He has sent 
His Messenger for your guidance and instruction and sent down this great Book so 
that you may avoid errors and follow the right path which may lead you to the 
successes of the world and the Hereafter.<br><br>Another translation can be: You 
should warn the people of the same of which their forefathers had been warned, 
because they live in heedlessness. If the first meaning, as given above in the 
text, is taken, the forefathers would imply the forefathers of the immediate 
past, for in the ancient time several Prophets had appeared in Arabia. And if 
the second meaning is adopted, it would imply this: Revive and refresh the 
message that had been conveyed to the forefathers of this nation by the Prophets 
in the past, for these people have forgotten it. Obviously, there is no 
contradiction between the two translations, and, as to meaning, each is correct 
in its own place.<br><br>A doubt may rise here: How could the forefathers of a 
nation to whom no warner had been sent at a particular time in the past, be held 
responsible for their deviation at that time? The answer is: When Allah sends a 
Prophet in the world, the influence of his message and teaching spreads far and 
wide, and is handed down by one generation to the other. As long as this 
influence remains and there continue arising among the followers of the Prophet 
such people as keep his message of guidance fresh, the period of time cannot be 
said to be without the guidance. And when the influence of the Prophet’s 
teaching dies out, or the teaching is tampered with, the appointment of another 
Prophet becomes inevitable. Before the advent of the Prophet (peace be upon him) 
the influence of the teachings of the Prophets Abraham, Ishmael, Shuaib and 
Moses and Jesus (peace be upon all of them) could be seen everywhere in Arabia 
and from time to time there had been arising among the Arabs, or coming from 
outside, men, who revived their teachings. When the influence was about to die 
out, and the real teaching was also distorted, Allah raised the Prophet Muhammad 
(peace be upon him), and made such arrangements that his message can neither be 
wiped out nor tampered with. (For further explanation, see E. N. 5 of Surah 
Saba).<br><br>This is about those people who were being obstinate and stubborn 
with regard to the message of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and had made up 
their minds not to listen to him at all. This is because: They have already 
deserved the torment; therefore, they do not believe. It means: The people who 
do not heed the admonition, and persist in their denial and hostile attitude to 
the truth in spite of the final warning from Allah conveyed through the 
Prophets, are themselves overwhelmed by the evil consequences of their misdeeds 
and deprived of every opportunity to believe. The same thing has been expressed 
more clearly in verse 11 below: You can only warn him who follows the admonition 
and fears the Merciful God though he cannot see Him.<br><br>“Shackles” in this 
verse implies their own stubbornness which was preventing them from accepting 
the truth. “Reaching to chins” and “so they are made stiff-necked” implies the 
stiffness of the neck which is caused by pride and haughtiness. Allah means to 
impress this: We have made their obstinacy and stubbornness the shackles of 
their neck, and their pride and haughtiness has made them so stiff-necked that 
they will not pay heed to any reality, however clear and evident it may be.<br>
<br>Setting a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, means that the 
natural result of their stubbornness and pride is that they neither learn any 
lesson from their past history nor ever consider the consequences of the future. 
Their prejudices have so covered them from every side and their misconceptions 
have so blinded them that they cannot see even those glaring realities which are 
visible to every right-thinking and unbiased person.<br><br>This does not mean 
that it is futile to preach, but it means: Your preaching reaches every kind of 
people. Some of them are the ones mentioned above, and some others those who are 
being mentioned in the next verse. When you come across the people of the first 
kind and you see that they continue to persist in their denial, pride and 
antagonism, you should leave them alone, but at the same time you should not 
feel disheartened so as to give up your mission, for you do not know exactly 
where among the multitudes of the people are those sincere servants of God, who 
would heed your admonition and fear God and turn to the right path. The real 
object of your preaching, therefore, should be to search out and collect this 
second kind of the people. You should ignore the stubborn people and gather this 
precious element of the society about you.<br><br>This shows that three kinds of 
the entries are made in the conduct-book of men. First, whatever a person does, 
good or bad is entered in the divine register. Second, whatever impressions a 
man makes on the objects of his environment and on the limbs of his own body 
itself, become recorded, and all these impressions will at one time become so 
conspicuous that man’s own voice will become audible and the whole history of 
his ideas and intentions and aims and objects and the pictures of all of his 
good and bad acts and deeds will appear before him. Third, whatever influences 
he has left behind of his good and bad actions on his future generation, on his 
society and on mankind as a whole, will go on being recorded in his account as 
far as they reach and as long as they remain active and operative. The full 
record of the good and bad training given by him to his children, the good or 
evil that he has spread in the society, and its impact on mankind as a whole, 
will go on being maintained till the time that it goes on producing good or evil 
results in the world.<br><br>The early commentators, generally, have expressed 
the opinion that the habitation implies the Syrian city of Antioch, and the 
messengers mentioned here were the ones sent by the Prophet Jesus for the 
preaching of his message there. Another thing that has been mentioned in this 
connection is that Antiochus was the king of this land at that time. But 
historically this story which Ibn Abbas, Qatadah, Ikrimah, Kaab Ahbar and Wahb 
bin Munabbih, and others have related on the basis of unauthentic Christian 
traditions is baseless. There have been 13 kings of the Seleucid dynasty named 
Antiochus who reigned in Antioch, and the rule of the last king of this name, 
rather the rule of this dynasty itself, came to an end in 65 B.C. At the time of 
the Prophet Jesus, the whole land of Syria and Palestine, including Antioch, was 
under the Romans. Then, no proof is forthcoming from any authentic tradition of 
the Christians that the Prophet Jesus might himself have sent any of his 
disciples to Antioch for preaching his message. On the contrary, the Acts of the 
Apostles (N.T.) shows that the Christian preachers had reached Antioch for the 
first time a few years after the event of the crucifixion. Now, evidently, the 
people who were neither appointed messengers by Allah nor sent by His Messenger 
cannot be regarded as messengers of Allah by any interpretation even if they 
might have travelled for the purpose of preaching of their own accord. Moreover, 
according to the Bible, Antioch was the first city where the non-Israelites 
embraced Christianity in large numbers and where the Christian faith met with 
great success; whereas the habitation mentioned by the Quran was some such 
habitation which rejected the invitation of the messengers, and was consequently 
punished with a divine torment. History also does not bear any evidence that 
Antioch was ever afflicted with a destruction, which might be regarded, as the 
result of denying the Prophethood.<br><br>On account of these reasons it cannot 
be accepted that the habitation implies Antioch. The habitation has neither been 
clearly determined in the Quran nor in any authentic Hadith. The identity of the 
messengers also is not known through any authentic means nor the time when they 
were appointed. To understand the purpose for which the Quran is narrating this 
story here, it is not necessary to know the names of the habitation and the 
messengers. The object is to warn the Quraish, as if to say: You are following 
the same path of stubbornness, prejudice and denial of the truth as had been 
followed by the people of that habitation, and are preparing yourselves to meet 
the same doom as was met by them.<br><br>In other words, what they wanted to say 
was: Since you are human beings, you cannot be the messengers of God. The same 
was the view of the disbelievers of Makkah. They also said: Muhammad cannot be a 
messenger because he is a man.<br><br>They say: What sort of a Messenger is he 
that he eats food and moves about in the streets. (Surah Al-Furqan, Ayat 7).<br>
<br>And the unjust people whisper to one another, saying: This man is no more 
than a human being like yourselves. What, will you then be enticed by this 
sorcery while you perceive it. (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayat 3).<br><br>The Quran 
refutes this erroneous notion of the people of Makkah and says that it is not 
any new kind of ignorance which these people are displaying, but all the 
ignorant people since the earliest times have been involved in the 
misunderstanding that a human being cannot be a messenger and a Messenger cannot 
be a human being. When the chiefs of the people of the Prophet Noah (peace be 
upon him) had rejected his Prophethood, they had said the same thing:<br><br>
This person is no more than a human being like yourselves. By this he purely 
intends to obtain superiority over you. Had Allah willed, He would have sent 
down angels. Since the time of our forefathers we have never heard (that a human 
being should come as a Messenger). (Surah Al-Mominoon, Ayat 24).<br><br>The 
people of Aad had said the same about the Prophet Hud (peace be upon him): This 
person is no more than a human being like yourselves, for he eats of what you 
eat and drinks of what you drink. Now if you submit to a human being like 
yourselves, you will indeed be the losers. (Surah Al-Mominoon, Ayats 33-34).<br>
<br>The people of Thamud also said the same about the Prophet Salih (peace be 
upon him): Shall we follow a man from among ourselves? (Surah Al-Qamar, Ayat 
24). And the same thing happened with almost every Prophet that the disbelievers 
said: You are no more than a human being like ourselves, and the Prophets always 
replied: It is true that we are no more than human beings like you, but Allah 
shows His favor to anyone of His servants He pleases. (Surah Ibrahim, Ayats 
10-11).<br><br>Then the Quran says that this very notion of ignorance has been 
preventing the people from accepting guidance in every age, and the same has 
been the cause of every nation's downfall.<br><br>Has not the news reached to 
you of those who had disbelieved before this, and then tasted the evil results 
of their deeds. And in the Hereafter there awaits them a painful torment. They 
deserved this fate because their Messengers came to them with clear signs, but 
they said: Shall human beings show us guidance. So they refused and turned away. 
(Surah At-Taghabun, Ayats 5-6).<br><br>Whenever guidance came before the people, 
nothing prevented them from believing in it except this (excuse): they said: Has 
Allah sent a human being as His messenger? (Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 94).<br><br>
Then the Quran says explicitly that Allah has always sent human beings as the 
Messengers and a human being alone can be a Messenger for the guidance for 
mankind and not an angel, or a supernatural being:<br><br>And We sent before you 
also human beings as Messengers to whom We revealed (Our message). If you (O 
objectors) have no knowledge of this, you may ask those who have the knowledge. 
We did not give them such bodies as could survive without food nor were they 
immortal. (Surah Al-Anbiya, Ayats 7-8).<br><br>“All the Messengers whom We sent 
before you also ate food and moved about in the streets. (Surah Al-Furqan, Ayat 
20).<br><br>O Prophet, say to them: Had angels settled on the earth and moved 
about in peace, We would certainly have sent an angel as a messenger to them. 
(Surah Bani-Israil, Ayat 95).<br><br>This is another notion of ignorance in 
which the disbelievers of Makkah were involved. In it are also involved the 
so-called rationalists of today and in it have been involved the deniers of 
revelation and Prophethood of every age since the earliest times. These people 
have held the view that Allah does not send down any revelation at all for the 
guidance of man. He is only concerned with the affairs of the heavens: He has 
left the affairs and problems of man to be resoled by man himself.<br><br>That 
is, our duty is only to convey to you the message that Allah has entrusted us 
with. Then it is for you to accept it or reject it. We have not been made 
responsible to make you accept it forcibly, And if you do not accept it, we 
shall not be seized in consequence of your disbelief, You will yourselves be 
answerable for your crimes.<br><br>What they meant was: You are an evil omen for 
us. Our gods have become angry with us on account of what you have been saying 
against them. Now whatever calamity is befalling us is only because of you. 
Precisely the same thing used to be said by the disbelievers and the hypocrites 
of Arabia concerning the Prophet (peace be upon him): If they suffer a loss, 
they say: this is because of you. (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 77). That is why at 
several places in the Quran these people have been told that in the ancient 
times people also used to say such things of ignorance in regard to their 
Prophets. The people of Thamud said to their Prophet: We regard you and your 
companions as a sign of bad omen. (Surah An-Namal, Ayat 47). And the same was 
the attitude of the people of Pharaoh: Whenever a good time came, they would 
say: This is but our due, and when there was a hard time, they would ascribe 
their calamities to Moses (peace be upon him) and his companions. (Surah 
Al-Aaraf, Ayat 130).<br><br>That is, no one is an evil omen for another. 
Everyman’s augury is hanging around his own neck. If a person sees an evil, it 
is because of his own self; and if he sees a good, it is also because of his own 
self. We have fastened the augury of every man to his own neck. (Surah 
Bani-Israil, Ayat 13).<br><br>That is, you in fact want to avoid the good and 
you like the deviation instead of the guidance. Therefore, instead of 
determining the truth and falsehood by means of an argument, you are making 
these false pretenses on account of your superstitious whims.<br><br>That 
servant of God, in this one sentence, put together all the arguments required 
for determining the genuineness of Prophethood. The genuineness of a Prophet can 
be determined by two things. First, his word and deed; second, his being 
selfless. What the person meant to say was this: First, whatever these people 
are saying is perfectly reasonable, and their own character also is pure; 
second, no one can prove that they are calling the people to this faith on 
account of a selfish motive. Therefore, there is no reason why they should not 
be listened to. By citing this reasoning of the person the Quran set a criterion 
before the people of how to judge and determine the genuineness of the 
Prophethood of a Prophet, as if to say: The word and deed of the Prophet 
Muhammad (peace be upon him) bear full evidence that he is on the right path. 
Then, no one can point out any selfish motive or interest behind his struggle of 
preaching his message. Therefore, there is no reason why a sensible person 
should reject what he presents.<br><br>This sentence has two parts. The first 
part is a masterpiece of reasoning, the second of the wisdom of preaching. In 
the first part he says: To worship the Creator is the demand of both reason and 
nature; it would be highly unreasonable that one should worship those who have 
not created him and should deny to be the servant of Him Who has created him. In 
the second part he warns his people to the effect: All of you ultimately have to 
die and return to that God adoption of Whose service you object to. Therefore, 
you should consider for yourselves as to what goodness you could expect by 
turning away from Him.<br><br>That is, they are neither such favorites of God 
that even if I commit grave crimes, He will forgive me on their recommendation, 
nor are they so powerful that they should be able to rescue me if God may please 
to punish me.<br><br>If I make them my gods in spite of knowing all this.<br>
<br>This sentence again contains a subtle point of the wisdom of preaching. 
Saying this the man made the people realize: The Lord in Whom I have believed is 
not merely my Lord but your Lord, too. I have committed no error by believing in 
Him, but you, in fact, are certainly committing an error by not believing in 
Him.<br><br>That is, immediately following his martyrdom, the man was given the 
good news of Paradise. As soon as he entered the next world through the gate of 
death, there were the angels to receive him, and they gave him the good news 
that Paradise was awaiting him. The commentators have disputed the meaning of 
this sentence. Qatadah says: Allah admitted him into Paradise straight away and 
he is living in it and receiving his sustenance. And Mujahid says: This was told 
him by the angels as a good news; he will enter Paradise on the day of 
Resurrection along with the other believers.<br><br>This is a specimen of the 
high morality of the believer, He had no ill will or feeling of vengeance in his 
heart against the people who had just killed him so that he should invoke Allah 
against them. Instead, he was still wishing them well. After death the only wish 
that he cherished was: Would that my people could know the good end that I have 
met, and could learn a lesson from my death, if not from my life, and adopt the 
righteous way. The noble person did not wish Hell for his murderers but wished 
that they should believe and become worthy of Paradise. The same thing has been 
commended in the Hadith: He wished his people well when living as well as when 
dead.<br><br>Allah has narrated this event in order to warn the disbelievers of 
Makkah to the effect: Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his believing companions 
are also your wellwishers just as the believer was of his people. They do not 
cherish any ill-will or feeling of vengeance against you in spite of your 
persecutions of them. They are not your enemies but enemies of your deviation 
and error. The only object of their struggle against you is that you should 
adopt the right way.<br><br>This verse also is one of those verses which clearly 
prove the existence of barzakh. This shows that the period of time between death 
and Resurrection is not a period of nonexistence altogether, as some ignorant 
people think. But in this period the spirit lives without the body, speaks and 
hears speech, has feelings and desires, feels happy and unhappy, and also 
continues to be concerned about the people of the world. Had it not been so, the 
believer would not have been given the good news of Paradise after death, and he 
could not have wished that his people became aware of his good end.<br><br>These 
words contain a subtle satire. In their arrogance and pride of power and their 
strong antagonism towards the true faith, they thought they would annihilate the 
three Prophets and their followers, but, contrary to their plot, they were 
themselves annihilated by only one stroke of the divine punishment.<br><br>That 
is, they were annihilated so completely that not a trace of them was left behind 
them. No one in the world even remembers them today. Their civilization as well 
as their race has become extinct.<br>Until now the disbelieves of Makkah were 
being warned and reproved for their denial of the truth and their attitude of 
antagonism which they had adopted towards the Prophet (peace be upon him). Now 
the discourse turns to the basic thing which was the actual cause of the 
conflict between them and the Prophet (peace be upon him), i.e. the doctrine of 
Tauhid and the Hereafter, which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was presenting 
and the disbelievers were refusing to accept. In this connection, some arguments 
have been given, one after the other, to make the people ponder over the 
realities, as if to say: Observe these phenomena of the universe, which are ever 
present before you. Do they not point to the same reality, which this Prophet is 
presenting before you?<br><br>“A sign”: A sign that Tauhid is the truth and 
shirk the falsehood.<br><br>Another translation of this sentence can be: So that 
they may eat fruits thereof and what their own hands make. That is, the 
artificial kinds of food, which the people prepare from the natural products, 
e.g. bread, curry, jam, pickles, sauces and countless other things.<br><br>In 
these brief sentences the vegetable and plant life of the earth has been 
presented as an argument. Man is eating the products of the earth day and night 
and regards this as very ordinary. But if he considers it seriously, he will see 
that the growth of rich crops and lush green gardens from the dry earth and the 
flow of the springs and rivers is not a simple thing, which might be happening 
of itself, but there is a great wisdom and power and providence which is working 
behind it. Consider the reality of the earth. The substances of which it is 
composed do not possess any power of their own for growth. All these substances 
individually as well as after every sort of combination, remain inorganic, and 
thus do not possess any sign of life. The question is: How did it become 
possible for plant life to emerge from the lifeless earth? If one looks into it, 
one will see that there are some important factors without whose provision 
beforehand life here could not have come into existence.<br><br>First, in 
particular regions of the earth, on its outer surface, a layer was arranged of 
many such substances, which could serve as food for vegetation. This layer was 
kept soft so that the roots of the vegetation could spread in it and suck food.<br>
<br>Secondly, a system of irrigation was arranged on the earth in different ways 
so that the food elements could get dissolved in water and absorbed by the 
roots.<br><br>Thirdly, the atmosphere was arranged around the earth which 
protects it against the calamities of the sky, becomes a means of the rainfall, 
and possesses gases which are necessary for the life and growth of the 
vegetation.<br><br>Fourthly, a relationship was established between the sun and 
the earth so as to provide proper temperature and suitable seasons for the 
vegetation.<br><br>With the provision of these main factors (which in themselves 
are combinations of countless other factors), the coming to life of the 
vegetation becomes possible. After arranging the suitable conditions the seed of 
each species of the vegetation was so constituted that as soon as it received 
favorable soil, water, air and season, vegetable life should begin stirring 
within it. Besides, inside the same seed a system was so arranged that from the 
seed of every species a plant precisely of the same species should grow with all 
the characteristics of its own species and heredity. Then, in addition to this, 
another wonderful thing was done. Vegetation was not created in twenty, or 
fifty, or a hundred kinds but in countless species, and they were so made that 
they should fulfill the requirements of food, medicine and clothing and 
innumerable other needs of the countless kinds of animals and man, who were to 
be brought into being after the vegetation on the earth.<br><br>Anyone who 
ponders over this wonderful arrangement, if he is not stubborn and prejudiced, 
will himself testify that all this could not have come about by itself. There is 
certainly a wise plan underlying it, according to which harmonies and 
relationships of the soil, water, air and season with respect to the vegetation, 
and harmonics and relationships of the vegetation with respect to the needs and 
requirements of animals and human beings have been determined, keeping in view 
the finest detail. No sensible person can imagine that these universal, 
all-embracing relationships could be a mere accident. This same subtle 
arrangement points to the fact that this cannot be the work of many gods. This 
is, and can only be the work of One God, Who is the Creator and Lord of the 
earth, water, air, sun, vegetation, animals and mankind. If each of these had a 
separate god, it cannot be imagined that such a comprehensive and universal plan 
with such deep and wise relationship and harmony could be produced, and should 
have continued to work with such regularity for millions upon millions of years.<br>
<br>After giving these arguments for Tauhid, Allah says: Do they not then give 
thanks? That is: Are these people so thankless and ungrateful that they do not 
render thanks to that God Who has provided all this for their survival, but 
thank others for the blessings and favors done by Him? Are they so wretched that 
instead of bowing before Him they bow before the false gods, who have not 
created even a blade of grass for them?<br><br>Glory be to Him: He is free from 
every defect and fault, from every error and weakness, and that another one 
should be His associate and partner in His work. The Quran has generally used 
these words when refuting polytheistic beliefs, because every belief of shirk 
is, in fact, an imputation of some defect, some weakness and some fault to 
Allah. When a person says that Allah has an associate, he in fact, thinks that 
either Allah is incapable of running and ruling His Kingdom alone, or He is 
under compulsion to make another His associate in His work. Or, some other 
beings are so powerful in themselves that they are interfering in God’s 
administration and God is putting up with their interference. Or, God forbid, 
Allah has the weaknesses of the worldly kings, due to which He is surrounded by 
an army of ministers, courtiers, flatterers and beloved princes or princesses, 
and thus many powers of Godhead have become divided among them. Had there been 
no such notions of ignorance about Allah in the minds, there could be no 
question of any idea of shirk in the world. That is why it has been stated again 
and again in the Quran That Allah is free from and exalted far above those 
defects and faults and weaknesses which the mushriks ascribe to Him.<br><br>This 
is still another argument for Tauhid. Here again certain realities of daily 
experience have been mentioned and it is suggested that man observes these day 
and night but does not ponder over them seriously, whereas they contain signs 
and pointers to the reality. The coming together of the man and woman is the 
cause of man’s own birth. Procreation among the animals also is due to the 
combination between the male and the female. Also about vegetation, man knows 
that the law of sex is working in it. Even among the lifeless substances when 
different things combine with one another, a variety of compounds come into 
existence. The basic composition of matter itself has become possible due to the 
close affinity between the positive and the negative electric charges. This law 
of the pairs which is the basis of the existence of the entire universe, 
contains in itself such complexities and finenesses of wisdom and workmanship, 
and there exist such harmonies and mutual relationships between the members of 
each pair that an objective observer can neither regard it as the result of an 
accident, nor can he believe that many different gods might have created these 
countless pairs and matched their members, one with the other, with such great 
wisdom. The members of each pair being a perfect match for each other and coming 
into being of new things with their combination itself is an explicit argument 
of the Creator’s being One and only One.<br><br>The alternation of the night and 
day also is one of those realities which man does not regard as worthy of much 
attention only because it is a phenomenon of daily occurrence and experience; 
whereas if he considers how the day passes and how the night falls, and what is 
the wisdom in the passing of the day and in the falling of the night, he will 
himself realize that this is an obvious sign of the existence of an All-Powerful 
and All-Wise Allah and of His being One and only One. The day cannot pass and 
the night cannot fall until the sun hides from the earth. The great regularity 
which is found in the alternation of the day and night was not possible unless 
the sun and the earth were bound in one and the same relentless system. Then the 
deep relationship which exists between the alternation of the day and night and 
the other creations on the earth clearly points to the fact that this system has 
been established deliberately by a Being with perfect wisdom. The existence on 
the earth, of the men and animals and vegetation, and even of water and air and 
different minerals, is in fact, the result of placing the earth at a particular 
distance from the sun, with the arrangement that the different parts of the 
earth should go on successively coming before the sun and hiding from it at 
definite intervals. If the distance of the earth from the sun had been a little 
longer, or a little shorter, or there had been a perpetual night on one side of 
it and a perpetual day on the other, or the alternation of the day and night had 
been much faster or much slower, or sometimes the day had appeared suddenly and 
sometimes the night without any system, no life could be possible on this 
planet, and even the form and appearance of the inorganic substances would have 
been much different from what it is now. If the hearts are not blinded, one can 
clearly perceive in this system the working of a God, Who willed to bring into 
being this particular kind of creation on the earth and then established 
relevance, harmonies and relationships between the earth and the sun precisely 
in accordance with its needs and requirements. If a person regards the concept 
of the existence of God and His Unity as far removed from reason, he should 
think for himself and see how much farther removed should it be from reason to 
ascribe this wonderful creation to many gods, or to think that all this has 
happened automatically under some deaf and blind law of nature. When a person 
who can accept without question these latter unreasonable explanations, only on 
the basis of conjecture and speculation, says that the existence of a system and 
wisdom and purpose is not a sufficient proof of the existence of God, it becomes 
difficult for us to believe whether such a person really feels the need and 
necessity of a rational proof, sufficient or insufficient in any degree 
whatever, for accepting any concept of creed in the world.<br><br>“Place of 
rest” may either mean the place where the sun will ultimately come to a halt, or 
the time when it will come to a halt. The true meaning of this verse can be 
determined only when man has attained the full and exact knowledge of the 
realities of the universe. But man’s knowledge is such that it has been changing 
in every age and what he seems to know today might change tomorrow. The people 
of the ancient times on the basis of their observations of the sun believed that 
it was moving round the earth. Then after further research and observation the 
view became that the sun was stationary and all the planets of the solar system 
were revolving round it. But this theory also did not last long. The later 
observations revealed that not only the sun but all the stars are also moving in 
a particular direction, at speeds of 10 to 100 miles per second. About the sun 
the modern astronomers hold the view that it is moving at a speed of 20 
kilometers (about 12 miles) per second along with its whole family of the 
planets. (See Star and Sun in Encyclopedia Britannica).<br><br>That is, the 
phases of the moon go on changing throughout the month. It begins as a crescent, 
then goes on waxing every day till it becomes the full moon on the 14th of the 
month. Then it starts waning every day till at last it returns to its original 
shape of the crescent. The same has been happening for millions of years with 
perfect regularity, and no change has ever occurred in the phases of the moon. 
That is why one can always calculate and find out exactly in what phase the moon 
will be on a particular day. If the movement of the moon had not been bound in a 
system, estimation of its phases would not have been possible.<br><br>This 
sentence can have two meanings and both are correct.<br><br>(1) The sun does not 
have the power that it should draw the moon into itself, or enter its orbit and 
collide with it.<br><br>(2) The sun cannot appear in the times which have been 
appointed for the rising and appearing of the moon. It is not possible that the 
sun should suddenly appear on the horizon when the moon is shining at night.<br>
<br>Nor does this happen either that the night should approach before the 
appointed period of the day comes to an end, and should start spreading its 
darkness suddenly during the time when the day is meant to spread its light.<br>
<br>The word falak in Arabic is used for the orbit of the planets, and it gives 
a different meaning from the word sama (sky). The sentence, “Each in an orbit is 
floating” points to four realities.<br><br>(1) That not only the sun and the 
moon but all the stars and planets and celestial bodies are moving.<br><br>(2) 
The falak, or orbit, of each one of them is separate.<br><br>(3) That the orbits 
are not moving with the stars in them, but the stars are moving in the orbits.<br>
<br>(4) That the movement of the stars in their orbits is similar to the 
floating of something in a fluid.<br><br>These verses are not intended to 
describe the realities of astronomy, but are meant to make man understand that 
if he looks around himself, with open eyes, and uses his common sense, he will 
find countless and limitless proofs of the existence of God and His Unity, and 
he will not come across a single proof of atheism and shirk. The vastness of the 
solar system in which our earth is included is such that its parent body, the 
sun, is 300,000 times bigger than the earth, and its farthest planet Neptune is 
at least 2,793 million miles distant from the sun. However, if Pluto is taken as 
the farthest planet, it revolves 4,600 million miles away round it. 
Notwithstanding this vastness, the solar system occupies a very insignificant 
part of a huge galaxy. The galaxy which includes our solar system has about 
3,000 million suns in it, and its nearest sun is so distant from our earth that 
its light takes about four years to reach us. Then this galaxy also is not the 
whole universe. According to the investigations made so far, it has been 
estimated that it is one of about 2,000,000 spiral nebulae, and the nearest 
nebula is about a million light years away from the earth. As for the farthest 
celestial bodies which are visible through the modern instruments, their light 
reaches the earth in about 100 million years. Even now it cannot be claimed that 
man has seen the whole universe. It is a small part of the Kingdom of God which 
man has yet been able to observe. It cannot be predicted how far and deep man 
will yet be able to see with greater and more efficient means of observation at 
his disposal.<br><br>All the information that has been gathered so far about the 
universe proves that this whole world is made up of the same substance of which 
our tiny earthly world is made, and the same law is working in the universe 
which is working in the world of our earth; otherwise it was not at all 
possible, that man should have made observations of the very distant worlds from 
the earth, measured their distances and estimated their movements. Is it not a 
clear proof of the fact that this whole universe is the creation of One God and 
the Kingdom of One Ruler? Then from the order and the wisdom and the excellence 
of workmanship and the deep relationships which are found in the hundreds of 
thousands of the galaxies and in the millions and billions of the stars and 
planets revolving in them no sensible person can imagine that all this has come 
about automatically. Is it possible that there should be no administrator behind 
this order and system, no sage behind this wisdom, no designer behind this 
design and work of art, and no planner behind this planning?<br><br>“A laden 
vessel”: the Ark of the Prophet Noah (peace be upon him). As to boarding of the 
progeny of man in it, it means that although apparently a few companions of the 
Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) had boarded it, in reality all human beings who 
are to be born till Resurrection were boarding it; all the rest of mankind had 
been drowned in the flood, all later human beings are the children of those who 
were rescued in the Ark.<br><br>This indicates that the first vessel ever to be 
made in the world was the one made by the Prophet Noah (peace be upon him). 
Before that time man did not know any method of crossing the rivers and the 
seas. This method was first of all taught by Allah to the Prophet Noah (peace be 
upon him), and when some servants, of Allah were rescued in it from the flood, 
their future generations started making boats and ships for their sea journeys.<br>
<br>The signs until now were mentioned as arguments for Tauhid. This sign has 
been mentioned to make man realize that whatever powers he has been given over 
the forces of nature, have been given him by Allah and are not of his own 
acquirement. And whatever methods he has discovered of exploiting these forces; 
have been discovered also through the guidance of Allah and not solely by 
himself. Man did not have the power and strength to have subdued these great 
forces by his own power, nor the capability to have discovered the secrets of 
nature himself and known the methods of taking service from them. Then he can 
use and employ the forces over which he has been given control by Allah only 
till the time that Allah wills them to remain subdued to him. For when Allah 
wills otherwise the same forces which were serving man turn against him suddenly 
and he finds himself utterly helpless before them. To call man’s attention to 
this reality, Allah has presented the case of the sea journey only as an 
example. The whole human race would have perished in the flood had Allah not 
taught the method of making the vessel to the Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) 
and had his followers not boarded it. Then the scattering of the human race over 
the whole earth became possible only because the people learned the principles 
of building vessels from Allah and became able to cross the rivers and oceans. 
But from that humble beginning till today in spite of making great strides in 
the art of building huge ships and attaining every possible perfection in the 
science of navigation, man cannot claim that he has brought the rivers and the 
oceans fully under his control and power. Even today the water of God is still 
in God’s own power alone and whenever He wills He drowns man along with his 
ships in it.<br><br>“What is behind you”: Which the peoples before you have seen 
and experienced.<br><br>“Signs”: Verses of the divine Book by which man is 
admonished, and the signs which are found in the universe and in man’s own self 
and in his history which serve as abject lessons for man, provided he is 
inclined to learn any lesson.<br><br>This means to show that disbelief has not 
only blinded their intellect but has destroyed their moral sense, too. They 
neither have the right thought about Allah nor do they adopt the right attitude 
towards the people. They react adversely to every admonition, follow a perverse 
philosophy in respite of every deviation and immorality and have a ready-made 
pretense for escape from every good.<br><br>After Tauhid the other question 
about which a dispute was raging between the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the 
disbelievers was the question of the Hereafter. Rational arguments about this 
have been given in the end of the discourse. Here, before giving the arguments, 
the Hereafter has been depicted with all its horrors so that the people should 
know that what they are refusing to believe in cannot be averted by their 
denial, but they have to meet and experience it one day inevitably.<br><br>The 
question did not mean that they wanted to know the exact date of the coming of 
the Hereafter, and if, for instance, they were told that it would take place on 
such and such a date in such and such a month and year, their doubts would have 
been removed and they would have believed in it. Such questions, in fact, were 
put as a challenge only for the sake of argument. What they meant to say was 
that there would be no Resurrection whatever, as if to say: You are threatening 
us with Resurrection without rhyme or reason. That is why in reply it has not 
been said that Resurrection will take place on such and such a day, but that it 
shall come and shall be accompanied by such and such horrors.<br><br>That is, 
the Resurrection will not take place piecemeal so that the people may leisurely 
watch its coming, but it will come all of a sudden when the people will be 
engaged in their daily business and they will have no idea whatever that the end 
of the world had approached. There will be a terrible blast and everyone will 
fall dead at the spot. Abdullah bin Amr and Abu Hurairah have related a Hadith 
from the Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: The people will be walking on the 
roads as usual, will be buying and selling in the markets, will be disputing 
matters in their assemblies, when suddenly the Trumpet shall be sounded. 
Thereupon the one who was buying cloth would collapse and he would not have the 
time to put down the cloth from his hand; the one who was filling a cistern to 
water his animals would not have the time to water; and the one who was going to 
eat, would not have the time to lift the morsel to his mouth and Resurrection 
will take place.<br>For the explanation of the blowing of the Trumpet, see E.N. 
78 of Surah TaHa. As for the length of the interval between the first blowing of 
the Trumpet and its second blowing, we have no information. The interval may be 
of hundreds and thousands of years. Abu Hurairah has related that the Prophet 
(peace be upon him) said: Israfil has put the Trumpet to his mouth and is 
looking up to the divine Throne, awaiting orders for blowing it. The Trumpet 
will be blown thrice.<br><br>On the first blowing, called nafakhat al-faza, 
everything in the earth and heavens will be struck with terror. On the second 
blowing, called nafakhat as-Saaq, everyone will fall down dead. Then, when none 
shall remain except Allah, the One, the Everlasting, the earth will be changed 
altogether and will be spread flat and smooth without a crease or wrinkle on it. 
Then Allah will administer a rebuke to His Creation, whereupon everyone will 
rise at the spot where he had fallen dead, on the changed earth, and this will 
happen on the third blowing of the Trumpet called nafakhat al qiyam 
li-Rabbil-Alamin. This is supported by several allusions in the Quran also.<br>
<br>For example, see Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 48; Surah TaHa, Ayats 105-108, and the 
E.Ns thereof.<br><br>That is, at that time they will not realize that they had 
been dead and had been raised back to life after a long period, but they will be 
thinking that they had fallen asleep, and had been woken up suddenly by some 
terrible catastrophe, and were running away from it. (For further details, see 
Surahs TaHa, Ayat 103; Al-Hajj, Ayats 1-2).<br><br>Here, it is not clear as to 
who will give this answer. It may be that they themselves would realize after 
some time to their horror that it was the same thing of which the Messengers of 
God used to inform them and they used to belie them. It may also be that the 
believers will remove their misunderstanding and tell them that it was not 
waking up from sleep but the second life after death. And it may also be that 
they will understand this from the general conditions prevailing on the Day of 
Resurrection and the angels might tell them this.<br><br>This is what Allah will 
tell the disbelievers and the polytheists, the sinners and the culprits, when 
they will be presented before Him.<br><br>To understand this one should remember 
that the righteous believers will not be withheld in the Plain of Resurrection, 
but in the very beginning they will be sent to Paradise without accountability, 
or after a mild reckoning, because their record will be clean. There will be no 
need to keep them waiting during the hearing by the Court. Therefore, Allah will 
tell the culprits, who will be required to render their accounts, in the Plain 
of Resurrection: Look! the righteous people whom you used to mock and regard as 
foolish in the world, are today enjoying the pleasures of Paradise because of 
their wisdom, and you, who in your own judgment were very prudent and sagacious, 
are being condemned to accountability for your misdeeds.<br><br>This can have 
two meanings:<br><br>(1) Get you apart from the righteous believer; for in the 
world even if you belonged to the same community and the same clan and the same 
brotherhood, here you have no connection and relationship left with them.<br>
<br>(2) Get you apart from one another: now you can no longer remain a group. 
All your parties have been disbanded. All your relations and connections have 
been severed. Now each of you will be held answerable in your personal capacity 
for your actions and deeds.<br><br>53. Here again Allah has used ibadat 
(worship) in the sense of itaat (obedience). This subject has already been 
explained above in Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 172; Surah An- Nisa, Ayat 117, Surah 
Al-Anaam, Ayats 121, 137, Surah At- Taubah, Ayat 31; Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 22; 
Surah Al-Kahf, Ayat 52; Surah Maryam, Ayat 42, Surah Al-Qasas, Ayat 63 and E.N. 
63 of Surah Saba. In this connection, the fine explanation given of it by Imam 
Razi in his Tafsir Kabir is also noteworthy. He writes: Do not worship Satan 
means: Do not obey him, the reason being that only falling prostrate before him 
is not forbidden, but following him and obeying his commands also is forbidden; 
therefore, itaat (obedience) is ibadat (worship). After this, the Imam raises 
the question: If ibadat means itaat, then have the Muslims been commanded to 
worship the Prophet and the rulers in the verse: Atiullaha wa ati-ur-rasula wa 
ulil-amri min-kum? He himself answers it thus: If obedience to them is in 
accordance with the commands of Allah, it will be Allah’s worship (ibadat) and 
His obedience (itaat). Did not the angels fall prostrate before Adam in 
obedience to Allah’s command? This was nothing but worship of Allah. Obedience 
of the rulers will be their worship only in cases where they are obeyed in 
matters in which Allah has not given leave to obey them. Then he writes: If a 
person comes to you and commands you to do something, you should see whether his 
command is in accordance with the command of Allah or not. If it is not, Satan 
is with him; and if you obeyed him in this, you worshiped him and his Satan. 
Likewise, if your self urges you to do something, you should see whether it is 
permissible to do it according to the Sahariah or not. If it is not permissible, 
your self is Satan itself, or Satan is with it. If you obeyed him, you in fact 
became guilty of worshiping him. Further on, he writes: But there are different 
degrees of the worship of Satan. Sometimes it so happens that a man does a work 
and his limbs and his tongue also join him in this, and his heart also 
cooperates. At another time it so happens that a man uses his limbs to do a work 
but his heart and tongue do not cooperate in this. Some people commit a sin 
while their heart is disagreeable and their tongue is invoking Allah for 
forgiveness, and they confess that they are committing an evil. This is Satan’s 
worship with external limbs. There are other people who commit a crime with a 
cool mind and express pleasure and satisfaction with the tongue also. Such 
people are the worshipers of Satan from outside as well as from inside. (Tafsir 
Kabir, vol. VII, pp. 103-104).<br><br>That is, If you had been deprived of 
reason and you had served your enemy instead of your Lord, you could have the 
reason to offer an excuse. But you, in fact, had been blessed with reason by 
Allah and you were using it to advantage in all the affairs of the world, and 
you had been warned by Allah through the Prophets as well, yet, when you were 
deceived by your enemy and he succeeded in leading you astray, you could not be 
excused from the responsibility of your folly.<br><br>This command will be given 
in respect of the stubborn culprits, who will refuse to confess their crimes, 
will belie the witnesses, and will also not acknowledge the genuineness of their 
conduct-book. Then will Allah Almighty command: Well, stop your babbling. Just 
see what your own limbs say about your misdeeds. In this connection, here only 
the evidence to be given by the hands and the feet has been mentioned. But at 
other places it has been said that their eyes and their ears and their tongues, 
and the very skins of their body, will tell how they had been employed in the 
world. They should not forget the Day when their own tongues and their own hands 
and feet will bear testimony to their misdeeds. (Surah An-Noor, Ayat 24) Then, 
when all will have reached there, their ears and their eyes and their very skins 
will bear witness against them concerning what they had been doing in the world. 
(Surah HaMim-Sajdah, Ayat 20). The question arises: On the one hand, Allah says: 
We shall seal their mouths, and on the other hand, in the verse of Surah 
An-Noor, He says: Their tongues will bear testimony against them. How can these 
two things be reconciled? The answer is: To seal the mouths means to deprive 
them of their power of speech. That is, after this they will not be able to say 
whatever they like with their tongue. The testimony of their tongues means that 
their tongues themselves will tell how the wicked people had used them, what 
blasphemies and lies they had been made to utter, what mischief they had 
invented and what falsehoods they had been made to say on different occasions.<br>
<br>After depicting the scene of Resurrection, the people are being warned to 
this effect: The Resurrection may seem yet far off to you, but even if you 
consider seriously your life in this world of which you are so proud, you will 
see how helpless you are in the powerful grip of Allah. Your eyes by virtue of 
whose sight you are carrying out all your obligations in the world can be 
blinded at one command of Allah. Your legs on whose strength you are showing all 
this activity can become paralyzed as and when Allah wills. As long as the 
powers and capabilities granted by Allah continue to function, you remain lost 
in the arrogance of your self, but as soon as one of them fails to function, you 
come to understand how helpless you are.<br>“Reverse him in creation,” means 
that in old age Allah turns him back to the state of childhood. He becomes 
unable to stand and walk without the help and support of others; he is fed by 
others; he urinates and defecates in bed; talks childishly and is laughed at by 
others. In short, towards the end of life he returns to the same state of 
weakness with which he had started life in this world.<br><br>This is a 
rejoinder to the disbelievers, who slighted the Prophet (peace be upon him) and 
his message by branding him a poet when he preached Tauhid and talked of the 
Hereafter, life-after-death, and Hell and Heaven. (For further explanation, see 
Surah Ash-Shuara, Ayats 224-227 and the E.Ns thereof).<br><br>Every living 
person means: Every person who is capable of thinking and understanding, who is 
not like a stone, which neither hears nor understands nor moves from its place 
however rationally and sympathetically one may explain the distinction between 
the truth and falsehood and give admonition before him.<br><br>The word “hands” 
has been used metaphorically for Allah. This does not mean that, God forbid, 
Allah has a body and He works with the hands like human beings, but it means to 
impress that Allah has made these things Himself, and none else has any share in 
the matter of their creation.<br><br>It is ingratitude to regard a blessing as a 
gift of someone other than the donor, to be grateful to another for it, and to 
cherish the hope of receiving it or to seek it from another than the donor. 
Likewise, it is also ingratitude that one should use a blessing against the will 
of the donor. Therefore, a mushrik or a disbeliever or a hypocrite or a sinful 
person cannot be regarded as a grateful servant of God when he utters words of 
thankfulness only with the tongue. The disbelievers of Makkah did not deny that 
the cattle had been created by Allah; none of them said that the other deities 
had any hand in their creation. But despite knowing all this when they paid 
homage to their deities for the blessings granted by Allah, presented offerings 
before them and prayed to them for more blessings and offered sacrifices for 
their sake, their verbal gratitude became meaningless. That is why Allah has 
regarded them as guilty of ingratitude and thanklessness.<br><br>That is, the 
poor false gods themselves are dependent upon their worshipers for their 
survival and their safety and their needs. But for their multitudes they could 
not survive as gods even for a day. These people are behaving as their humble 
servants. They are setting up and decorating their shrines; they carry out 
propaganda for them; they fight and quarrel with others for their sake. Then 
only are they recognized as gods. They are not the real God, Who, whether 
someone recognizes Him or not, is ruling over the whole universe by His own 
might and authority.<br><br>The address is to the Prophet (peace be upon him). 
Here the allusion is to the campaign of vilification which the chiefs of the 
disbelievers of Makkah were carrying on against him. They knew in their hearts 
and acknowledged in their private assemblies that the charges they brought 
against him were absolutely baseless. In order to create suspicions against him 
in the minds of the people, they branded him a poet, sorcerer, magician, madman, 
etc. But their consciences recognized, and they also acknowledged before one 
another, that whatever they were uttering was false, which they were forging 
only to frustrate his mission. That is why Allah says to His Prophet: Do not 
grieve at their absurd and meaningless talk. Those who are opposing and 
resisting the truth with falsehood shall ultimately meet with failure in this 
world and see their evil end in the Hereafter, too.<br><br>Here the 
disbelievers’ question cited in verse 48 above, is being answered by reason and 
argument. The question: When will the threat of Resurrection be carried out? had 
not been asked with a view to find out the exact date of the coming of the 
Hereafter. But they asked it because they thought it was impossible, rather 
irrational, that human beings would be raised back to life after death. That is 
why, in reply to their question, arguments are being given for the possibility 
of the Hereafter. According to the traditions related by Ibn Abbas, Qatadah and 
Said bin Jubair, one of the chiefs of Makkah, on this occasion, came up with a 
rotten bone of a dead person, from the graveyard. He broke and crushed it into 
pieces before the Prophet (peace be upon him) and scattering its particles in 
the air, said: O Muhammad, you say that the dead will be raised back to life. 
Tell us who will give life to these decayed and rotten bones? The answer was 
given immediately in the form of these verses.<br><br>That is, We caused the 
sperm-drop which contained nothing but the basic germ of life to develop to an 
extent that it started moving and eating like the animals. Furthermore, it has 
developed such powers of intellect and reasoning and disputation and speech, 
which are not possessed by any animal; so much so that now he dares stand up as 
an adversary before his Creator!<br><br>That is, he regards Us powerless and 
weak like the creation, and thinks that just as man cannot raise the dead back 
to life, so also can’t We.<br><br>“Forgets his own creation”: Forgets that We 
created the basic germ of life from dead matter, which became the means of his 
creation; then We caused the germ to develop to such an extent that now he 
stands before Us as a disputant.<br><br>It either means that He has placed the 
inflammable matter in the green trees due to which people kindle fire from the 
pieces of wood. Or, it is an allusion to the markh and afar trees, whose green 
branches the Arabs struck against each other to produce the sparks. In ancient 
times the Bedouins used this method of kindling the fire and might even be using 
the same today.</p>
