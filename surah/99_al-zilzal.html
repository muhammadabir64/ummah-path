                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
                        <p>Zalzalah means to shake violently over and over again. Thus, zulzilat-il ardu
                          means that the earth will be shaken violently by convulsion after convulsion,
                          and since shaking of the earth has been mentioned, it automatically gives the
                          meaning that the entire earth will be shaken and not a limited territory of it.
                          Then, in order to express the great intensity of the earthquake the word
                          zilzalaha has been added, which literally means: its being shaken. It means: It
                          will be so shaken as a huge sphere like it ought to be shaken, or shaken to its
                          utmost intensity. Some commentators have taken it to imply the first earthquake
                          with which the first stage of Resurrection will begin, i.e. when all living
                          beings will perish and the present order of the world will be upset. But,
                          according to a large section of them, it implies the earthquake with which the
                          second stage of Resurrection will begin, i.e. when all the former and the latter
                          generations of mankind will rise back to life. This second commentary seems to
                          be more correct, for the whole subsequent theme supports it.<br><br>This same
                          has been expressed in Surah Al-Inshiqaq, Ayat 4, thus: And throws out whatever
                          is within it, and becomes empty. It has several meanings:<br><br>(1) It will
                          cast out bodies of the dead in whatever form and state and wherever they may be
                          lying in the earth; and the following sentence indicates that at that time all
                          the scattered parts of the bodies will reassemble and be resurrected once again
                          in the same form and shape as they had been in their first life, for if it were
                          not so, how will they say: What has happened to the earth? It will not only cast
                          out the dead bodies of men but also all traces and evidences of the words, deeds
                          and activities of their former life lying buried in it; the following sentence
                          points out that the earth will narrate all that had happened on its back.<br>
                          <br>(2) A third meaning has also been given by some commentators, saying that it
                          will cast out the treasures of gold, silver, jewels and every kind of wealth
                          lying hidden in the earth’s belly and man will see it and realize how he
                          thirsted for these things in the world, how he committed murders, thefts,
                          robberies and piracies in the land and sea, usurped the rights of others, waged
                          wars and devastated vast populations. On that Day all that will lie heaped up
                          before him, yet of no avail, but will rather become a means of punishment for
                          him.<br><br>Man here may as well imply every man, for after resurrection and
                          coming to senses the first impression of every man will be as to what was
                          happening around him; afterwards he will realize that it was the Resurrection
                          Day. Man may also imply the man who denies the Hereafter, for what he regarded
                          as impossible would be happening in front of him and causing him confusion and
                          bewilderment. As for the believers, they will not be bewildered and confused,
                          for everything would be taking place according to their belief and conviction.
                          To an extent, this second meaning is supported by verse 52 of Surah YaSeen, in
                          which it has been said that the deniers of the Hereafter at that time will
                          exclaim: Ah, who has roused us from our sleeping place? And the reply given
                          would be: This is the same which the Merciful God had promised and the
                          Messengers sent by God had spoken the truth. This verse does not expressly say
                          that this answer to the disbelievers would actually be given by the believers,
                          for there is no indication of it in the verse. The probability, however, is that
                          the believers will give them this answer.<br><br>According to Abu Hurairah, the
                          Prophet (peace be upon him) recited this verse and asked: Do you know what
                          annals it will relate? The people said: Allah and His Messenger have the best
                          knowledge. Thereupon the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The annals are that
                          the earth will testify to the deeds which every man and woman has done on its
                          back. It will say: He or she had done such and such a thing on such and such a
                          day. These will be the annals the earth will narrate. (Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi,
                          Nasai, Ibn Jarir, Abd bin Humaid, Ibn al-Mundhir, Hakim, Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi
                          in Ash-Shuab). According to Rabiah Kharashi, the Prophet (peace be upon him)
                          said: Beware of the earth, for it is your root and basis, and there is nothing
                          which a person does on it, and it will not report, whether it is good or bad.
                          (Mujam at-Tabarani). Anas reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The
                          earth on the Day of Resurrection will bring out every act that would have been
                          done on its back. Then he recited these verses. (Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi). About
                          Ali it is related that when he distributed the money of the Bait al- Mal (public
                          treasury) among the needy ones and thus emptied it, he would perform two rakahs
                          of the Prayer in it and say: You will have to bear witness that I filled you
                          with justice and emptied you with justice.<br><br>It might have been difficult
                          for a man of ancient times to understand how the earth will speak and narrate
                          the annals and events happening on it on the Resurrection Day, but in the
                          present age of scientific discoveries and the inventions of cinema, loudspeaker,
                          radio, television, tape-recorder, electronic equipment, etc., it is no longer
                          difficult to understand how the earth will narrate its annals. The impression of
                          whatever man speaks is preserved in the air, in the radio waves, on the
                          particles of the walls and floors and ceilings of the houses, and on the
                          environments of the road, plain or field if he spoke outside the house. If Allah
                          so wills He can make these things repeat all these voices precisely in the way
                          these were uttered in the first instance by man. Man at that time will hear with
                          his ears and know that it was his own voice, and all his acquaintances will also
                          testify that whatever they were hearing was the person’s own voice and his own
                          accent. Then whatever man has done anywhere on the earth, and in whatever state,
                          has had its impression on everything of the environment and its image inscribed
                          on it. Even if he did something in pitch dark, there are such rays in the
                          Kingdom of God for which darkness and light make no difference; they can
                          preserve his image in any case. All these images will pass before man on the
                          Resurrection Day like a motion picture, and will show him when and where he had
                          done something during his life on the earth.<br><br>The fact is that although
                          Allah directly knows whatever a man does, yet in the Hereafter when He will
                          establish His court, He will punish every culprit only after fulfilling all the
                          demands of justice. Any case which is brought before His court against a
                          criminal will be proved with such perfect evidence that no room will be left to
                          doubt his being a criminal. The first and foremost evidence against him is the
                          record in which the two recording angels are recording his each word and deed.
                          (Surah Qaaf, Ayats 17-18; Surah Al-Infitar, Ayats 10-12). This record will be
                          handed over to him and he will be asked to read it, for “you yourself suffice as
                          reckoner against yourself.” (Surah Bani Israil, Ayat 14). Reading it man will be
                          bewildered, for “it has left nothing un-recorded of our deeds, small or great.”
                          (Surah Al-Kahf, Ayat 49). Then there is man’s own body which he had used in the
                          world. In Allah’s court his own tongue will bear witness as to what he had been
                          speaking through it in the world, his own hands and feet will bear witness as to
                          what deeds he had committed through them (Surah An-Noor, Ayat 24). His eyes and
                          his ears will bear witness as to what he saw and heard by their means. Even the
                          skin of his body will bear witness to his deeds. Bewildered, he will ask his
                          limbs: Why have you borne witness against me? They will reply: The same God Who
                          has given speech to everything has given us speech. (Surah HaMim As-Sajdah,
                          Ayats 20- 22). On top of these, there will be the witnesses which will be
                          presented from the earth and all its environments, in which man will hear his
                          own voice by his own ears and see the exact pictures of his own deeds by his
                          eyes. Furthermore, the ideas, motives and aims hidden in the heart of man and
                          the intentions with which he had performed every deed will be brought out and
                          placed before him as is stated in Surah Al-Adiyat. That is why with the
                          production of such absolute, clear and undeniable proofs, man will be confounded
                          and he will be left with no chance to say anything in self-defense to excuse
                          himself. (Surah Al-Mursalat, Ayats 35-36).<br><br>This can have two meanings:<br>
                          <br>(1) That each man will present himself in his own individual capacity.
                          Families, groups, parties, nations, all will scatter away. This thing has also
                          been said at other places in the Quran, for e.g. according to Surah Al-Anaam,
                          Ayat 94, Allah on that Day will say to the people: So, you have come before Us
                          all alone, as We created you the first time, and in Surah Maryam: He will appear
                          before Us all alone (verse 80); and Everyone of them will be presented before
                          Him individually on the Resurrection Day. (verse 95).<br><br>(2) That the people
                          who during thousands and thousands of years had died at different places; will
                          be rising from different corners of the earth and proceeding in groups, as has
                          been said in Surah An-Naba: The day the Trumpet is blown, you will come out in
                          crowds. (verse 18).<br><br>Apart from these, there is no room in the word
                          ashtatan for the meanings, which different commentators have given, and are,
                          therefore, outside the literal bounds of this word, although they are correct by
                          themselves and in accordance with the conditions depicted of the Resurrection
                          Day in Quran and the Hadith.<br><br>This can have two meanings:<br><br>(1) That
                          they are shown their deeds, i.e. each one will be told what he did in the world.<br>
                          <br>(2) That they are shown the rewards of their deeds.<br><br>Although this
                          second meaning can also be taken of the words li yurau jazaa a malahum (so as to
                          be shown the rewards of their deeds) but li yurau a malahum (so as to be shown
                          their deeds). Therefore, the first meaning is preferable, especially when at
                          several places in the Quran it has been stated clearly that the disbeliever and
                          the believer, the righteous and the wicked, the obedient and the disobedient,
                          all will be given their records. (see Surah Al- Haqqah, Ayats 19, 25; Surah
                          Al-Inshiqaq, Ayats 7, 10). Evidently, there is no difference between showing
                          somebody his deeds and handing over to him his record. Furthermore, when the
                          earth will narrate whatever had happened on it, the whole picture of the
                          conflict between the truth and the falsehood that has been raging since the
                          beginning of time and will continue to rage till the end, will also appear
                          before the people and they will see what part the truth loving people played in
                          it and what vile deeds did the supporters of falsehood commit against them. It
                          may well be that the people will hear with their own ears all the speeches and
                          dialogues of the callers to right guidance and of the publicists of error and
                          evil; the whole record of the writings and literature produced by the two sides
                          will be placed intact before them, and the people gathered together in the Plain
                          of Assembly will see with their own eyes the persecution of the lovers of truth
                          by the worshippers of falsehood and all the scenes of the bitter conflict that
                          raged between the two parties.<br><br>A simple and straightforward meaning of
                          this statement, and it is right and correct, is that not an atom’s weight of
                          good or evil done by a person, will have been left unrecorded in his conduct
                          book, and he will see it in any case. But if seeing is taken to imply seeing its
                          reward and punishment, it will be wrong to take it in the meaning that in the
                          Hereafter every person will be rewarded for his most minor offence, and no one
                          will be left un-rewarded for a good and unpunished for an evil done by him. For
                          in the first place, it would mean that each evil act will be punished and each
                          good act rewarded separately; secondly, it also means that no believer, however
                          righteous and virtuous, will remain safe from being punished for a most ordinary
                          error, and no disbeliever, however wicked and iniquitous, will be left
                          unrewarded for a most ordinary good act. Both these meanings are opposed not
                          only to the explanations given in the Quran and the Hadith, but also to reason.
                          From the point of view of reason, it is not understandable that a master would
                          refuse to pardon a most loyal and dutiful servant for a minor error, and along
                          with rewarding for each act of service and obedience, would also punish him for
                          each and every error. Likewise, this also is not understandable from the
                          viewpoint of reason that a person brought up and favored by you should prove
                          disloyal and treacherous and ungrateful in spite of your favors, and you,
                          over-looking his collective attitude, should punish him for each act of
                          treachery separately and reward him for each, even if most insignificant, act of
                          service separately. As for the Quran and the Hadith, they have laid down a
                          detailed law of rewards and punishments for the different categories of the
                          people, be they believers, hypocrites, disbelievers, righteous believers, erring
                          believers, wicked and sinful believers, common disbelievers, or wicked and
                          mischievous disbelievers, and these rewards and punishments pervade the entire
                          life of man, from here to the Hereafter.<br><br>In this connection, the Quran
                          has stated, in principle, certain things explicitly:<br><br>First, that the
                          deeds of the disbelievers, idolaters and hypocrites (i.e. the deeds regarded as
                          virtuous) have been rendered vain; they will receive no reward for them in the
                          Hereafter. If at all they deserve a reward for them, they will receive it here
                          in the world. For this, see Surah Al-Aaraf, Ayat 147; Surah At-Taubah, Ayat 17,
                          67-69; Surah Houd, Ayats 15-16; Surah Ibrahim, Ayat 18; Surah Al-Kahf, Ayat 104,
                          105; Surah An-Noor, Ayat 39; Surah Al-Furqan, Ayat 23; Surah Al-Ahzab, Ayat 19;
                          Surah Az-Zumar, Ayat 65; Surah Al-Ahqaf, Ayat 20.<br><br>Second, that evil will
                          be punished to the extent that evil has been committed, but the good deeds will
                          be rewarded much more generously than what they will actually deserve. At some
                          places it has been explicitly stated that a good act will have a ten-fold reward
                          for it, and at others that Allah will increase the reward of the good act as
                          much as He will please. For this, see Surah Al-Baqarah, Ayat 261; Surah Al-
                          Anaam, Ayat 160; Surah Younus, Ayats 26-27; Surah An- Noor, Ayat 38, Surah
                          Al-Qasas, Ayat 84; Surah Saba, Ayat 37, Surah Al-Mumin, Ayat 40.<br><br>Third,
                          that if the believers abstained from major sins, their ordinary offences will be
                          forgiven. (Surah An-Nisa, Ayat 31; Surah Ash-Shura, Ayat 37; Surah An-Najm, Ayat
                          32).<br><br>Fourth, that the righteous believer shall have an easy reckoning,
                          his evils will be overlooked and he will be rewarded according to his best
                          deeds. (Surah Al-Ankabut, Ayat 7; Surah Az-Zumar, Ayat 35; Surah Al-Ahqaf, Ayat
                          16; Surah Al-Inshiqaq, Ayat 8).<br><br>The Hadith is also very explicit in this
                          regard. In the commentary of Surah Al-Inshiqaq above, we have cited the Ahadith
                          which have been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in connection with
                          the explanation of easy reckoning and severe accountability. (See E.N. 6 of
                          Surah Al-lnshiqaq). Anas says that once Abu Bakr Siddiq was having his meals
                          with the Prophet (peace be upon him). In the meantime this verse was revealed.
                          Abu Bakr withdrew his hand from food and said: O Messenger (peace be upon him)
                          of Allah, shall I see the result of every little evil that I have happened to
                          commit? The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: O Abu Bakr, whatever unpleasant
                          and troublesome things you experience in the world, will compensate for the
                          little evils that you happened to commit, and Allah is reserving every little
                          good that you do for your Hereafter, (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Tabarani in
                          Al-Ausat, Baihaqi in Ash-Shuab. Ibn al-Mundhir, Hakim, Ibn Marduyah, Abd bin
                          Humaid). The Messenger (peace be upon him) of Allah had also explained this
                          verse to Abu Ayyub Ansari, saying: Whoever from among you does good will have
                          his reward in the Hereafter, and whoever commits an evil will suffer punishment
                          for it in this very world in the form of misery and disease. (Ibn Marduyah).
                          Qatadah has related this saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the
                          authority of Anas: Allah does not wrong a believer in the world. He provides him
                          sustenance in lieu of his good deeds, in the Hereafter He will reward him for
                          these. As for the disbeliever, he is recompensed for his good deeds in the world
                          itself; then when Resurrection takes place, he, will have no good work left to
                          his credit. (lbn Jarir). Masruq has related from Aishah that she asked the
                          Prophet (peace be upon him): In the pre-Islamic days of ignorance Abdullah bin
                          Judan treated his kindred kindly, fed the poor, received his guests well, earned
                          freedom for the captives. Will this be of any use to him in the Hereafter? The
                          Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: No, he never said until death:
                          Rabbighfir-li khatiati yaum ad-din. My Lord, forgive me my errors on the
                          Judgement Day. (lbn Jarir). The Prophet (peace be upon him) also gave similar
                          replies in respect of the other people, who did good deeds in the pre-Islamic
                          days, but died as pagans. But there are certain other sayings of the Prophet
                          (peace be upon him), which show that although the good done by a disbeliever
                          cannot save him from the fire of Hell, yet in Hell he will not be subjected to
                          the severe punishment which will be the lot of the wicked, sinful and villainous
                          disbelievers, e.g. according to a Hadith, Hatim Tai in view of his generosity
                          will be subjected to a light punishment in Hell (Ruh al-Maani).<br><br>However,
                          this verse warns man of a truth of vital importance which is this: Even a most
                          ordinary good has its own weight and its own value, and the same is also true of
                          evil: even a most ordinary evil will also be considered and taken into account;
                          it will not just be overlooked. Therefore, no good act, however small and
                          insignificant, should be left, undone, for many such good acts can collect and
                          be regarded as a major good act in the reckoning with Allah. Likewise, even a
                          most ordinary evil also should not be committed, for a large number of such
                          ordinary errors can become serious sins. The same thing has been described by
                          the Prophet (peace be upon him) in several Ahadith. According to a tradition
                          related in Bukhari and Muslim, on the authority of Adi bin Hatim, the Prophet
                          (peace be upon him) said: Save yourselves from the fire of Hell even if it be by
                          giving away a pit of a date, or by uttering a good word. Again from Adi, in an
                          authentic tradition, the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) saying has been reported:
                          Do not look upon any good work as insignificant, even if it be emptying a bucket
                          into the vessel of one asking for water, or receiving a brother of yours with a
                          pleasant face. According to a tradition reported in Bukhari from Abu Hurairah,
                          the Prophet (peace be upon him), addressing the women, said: O Muslim women, no
                          woman should look upon sending a gift to her neighbor as mean, even if it be the
                          hoof of a goat. A tradition has been related in Musnad Ahmad, Nasai and Ibn
                          Majah from Hadrat Aishah, saying that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: O
                          Aishah, abstain from the sins which are looked upon as trivial, for they too
                          will be enquired about by Allah. Musnad Ahmad contains a tradition from Abdullah
                          bin Masud, saying that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Beware of minor
                          sins, for they will gather together on man so much so that they will kill him.
                          (For the distinction between the grave and the trivial offences, see E.N. 53 of
                        Surah An-Nisa and E.N. 32 of Surah An-Najm).<br></p>
