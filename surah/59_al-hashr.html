So take what the Messenger assigns to you, and deny yourselves that which he withholds from you. And fear Allah; for Allah is strict in Punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> (Some part is due) to the indigent Muhajirs, those who were expelled from their homes and their property, while seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure, and aiding Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the sincere ones:-</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith,- show their affection to such as came to them for refuge, and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to the (latter), but give them preference over themselves, even though poverty was their (own lot).

                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
<p>The Surah derives its name from the mention of the word al-hashr in 
verse thereby implying that it is the Surah in which the word al-hashr has 
occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>Bukhari and Muslim contain a 
tradition from Hadrat Sa'id bin Jubair to the effect "When I asked Hadrat 
Abdullah bin Abbas about Surah Al-Hashr, he replied that it was sent down 
concerning the battle against the Bani an-Nadir just as Surah Al-Anfal was sent 
down concerning the Battle of Badr. In another tradition from Hadrat Sa'id bin 
Jubair, the words cited from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) are: Qul: 
Surah an-Nadir: Say, it is Surah an-Nadir." The same thing has been related also 
from Mujahid, Qatadah, Zuhri, Ibn Zaid, Yazid bin Ruman, Muhammad bin Ishaq and 
others. They are unanimous that the followers of the Book whose banishment has 
been mentioned in it, imply the Bani an-Nadir. Yazid bin Ruman, Mujahid and 
Muhammad bin Ishaq have stated that this whole Surah, from beginning to end, 
came down concerning this very battle.<br><br>As for the question as to when 
this battle took place, Imam Zuhri has stated on the authority of Urwah bin 
Zubair that it took place six months after the Battle of Badr. However, Ibn 
Sa'd, Ibn Hisham and Baladhuri regard it as an event of Rabi' al-Awwal, A. H. 4, 
and the same is correct. For all traditions agree that this battle took place 
after the incident of Bi'r Ma'unah, and historically also it is well known that 
the incident of Bir Ma'unah occurred after the Battle of Uhud and not before it.<br>
Historical Background<br><br>In order to understand the subject matter of this 
Surah well, it is necessary to have a look at the history of the Madinah and 
Hejaz Jews, for without it one cannot know precisely the real causes of the Holy 
Prophet's dealing with their different tribes the way he did.<br><br>No 
authentic history of the Arabian Jews exists in the world. They have not left 
any writing of their own in the form of a book or a tablet which might throw 
light on their past, nor have the Jewish historians and writers of the non-Arab 
world made any mention of them, the reason being that after their settlement in 
the Arabian peninsula they had detached themselves from the main body of the 
nation, and the Jews of the world did not count them as among themselves. For 
they had given up Hebrew culture and language, even the names, and adopted 
Arabism instead. In the tablets that have been unearthed in the archaeological 
research in the Hejaz no trace of the Jews is found before the first century of 
the Christian era, except for a few Jewish names. Therefore, the history of the 
Arabian Jews is based mostly on the verbal traditions prevalent among the Arabs 
most of which bad been spread by the Jews themselves.<br><br>The Jews of the 
Hejaz claimed that they had come to settle in Arabia during the last stage of 
the life of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). They said that the Prophet 
Moses had dispatched an army to expel the Amalekites from the land of Yathrib 
and had commanded it not to spare even a single soul of that tribe. The 
Israelite army carried out the Prophet's command, but spared the life of a 
handsome prince of the Amalekite king and returned with him to Palestine. By 
that time the Prophet Moses had passed sway. His successors took great exception 
to what the army had done, for by sparing the life of an Amalekite it had 
clearly disobeyed the Prophet and violated the Mosaic law. Consequently, they 
excluded the army from their community, and it had to return to Yathrib and 
settle there for ever.(Kitab al-Aghani, vol. xix, p. 94). Thus the Jews claimed 
that they had been living in Yathrib since about 1200 B.C. But, this had in fact 
no historical basis and probably the Jews had invented this story in order to 
overawe the Arabs into believing that they were of noble lineage and the 
original inhabitants of the land.<br><br>The second Jewish immigration, 
according to the Jews, took, place in 587 BC. when Nebuchadnezzer, the king of 
Babylon, destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed the Jews throughout the world. The 
Arab Jews said that several of their tribes at that time had come to settle in 
Wadi al-Qura, Taima, and Yathrib.(Al-Baladhuri, Futuh al-Buldan). But this too 
has no historical basis. By this also they might have wanted to prove that they 
were the original settlers of the area.<br><br>As a matter of fact, what is 
established is that when in A. D. 70 the Romans massacred the Jews in Palestine, 
and then in A. D. 132 expelled them from that land, many of the Jewish tribes 
fled to find an asylum in the Hejaz, a territory that was contiguous to 
Palestine in the south. There, they settled wherever they found water springs 
and greenery, and then by intrigue and through money lending business gradually 
occupied the fertile lands. Ailah, Maqna, Tabuk, Taima, Wadi al Qura, Fadak and 
Khaiber came under their control in that very period, and Bani Quraizah, Bani 
al-Nadir, Bani Bahdal, and Bani Qainuqa also came in the same period and 
occupied Yathrib.<br><br>Among the tribes that settled in Yathrib the Bani al 
Nadir and the Bani Quraizah were more prominent for they belonged to the Cohen 
or priest class. They were looked upon as of noble descent and enjoyed religious 
leadership among their co- religionists. When they came to settle in Madinah 
there were some other tribes living there before, whom they subdued and became 
practically the owners of this green and fertile land. About three centuries 
later, in A. D. 450 or 451, the great flood of Yemen occurred which has been 
mentioned in vv. 16-17 of Surah Saba above. As a result of this different tribes 
of the people of Saba were compelled to leave Yemen and disperse in different 
parts of Arabia. Thus, the Bani Ghassan went to settle in Syria, Bani Lakhm in 
Hirah (Iraq), Bani Khuzaah between Jeddah and Makkah and the Aus and the Khazraj 
went to settle in Yathrib. As Yathrib was under Jewish domination, they at first 
did not allow the Aus and the Khazraj to gain a footing and the two Arab tribes 
had to settle on lands that had not yet been brought under cultivation, where 
they could hardly produce just enough to enable them to survive. At last, one of 
their chiefs went to Syria to ask for the assistance of their Ghassanide 
brothers; he brought an army from there and broke the power of the Jews. Thus, 
the Aus and the Khazraj were able to gain complete dominance over Yathrib, with 
the result that two of the major Jewish tribes, Bani an-Nadir and Bani Quraizaha 
were forced to take quarters outside the city. Since the third tribe, Bani 
Qainuqa, was not on friendly terms with the other two tribes, it stayed inside 
the city as usual, but had to seek protection of the Khazraj tribe. As a counter 
measure to this Bani an Nadir and Bani Quraizah took protection of the Aus tribe 
so that they could live in peace in the suburbs of Yathrib.<br><br>Before the 
Holy Prophet's arrival at Madinah until his emigration the following were the 
main features of the Jews position in Hejaz in general and in Yathrib in 
particular:<br><br>In the matter of language, dress, civilization and way of 
life they had completely adopted Arabism, even their names had become Arabian. 
Of the 12 Jewish tribes that had settled in Hejaz, none except the Bani Zaura 
retained its Hebrew name. Except for a few scattered scholars none knew Hebrew. 
In fact, there is nothing in the poetry of the Jewish poets of the pre-Islamic 
days to distinguish it from the poetry of the Arab poets in language, ideas and 
themes. They even inter-married with the Arabs. In fact, nothing distinguished 
them from the common Arabs except religion. Notwithstanding this, they had not 
lost their identity among the Arabs and had kept their Jewish prejudice alive 
most ardently and jealously. They had adopted superficial Arabism because they 
could not survive in Arabia without it.<br><br>Because of this Arabism the 
western orientalists have been misled into thinking that perhaps they were not 
really Israelites but Arabs who had embraced Judaism, or that at least majority 
of them consisted of the Arab Jews. But there is no historical proof to show 
that the Jews ever engaged in any proselytizing activities in Hejaz, or their 
rabbis invited the Arabs to embrace Judaism like the Christian priests and 
missionaries. On the contrary, we see that they prided themselves upon their 
Israelite descent and racial prejudices. They called the Arabs the Gentiles, 
which did not mean illiterate or uneducated but savage and uncivilized people. 
They believed that the Gentiles did not possess any human rights; these were 
only reserved for the Israelites, and therefore, it was lawful and right for the 
Israelites to defraud them of their properties by every fair and foul means. 
Apart from the Arab chiefs, they did not consider the common Arabs fit enough to 
have equal status with them even if they entered Judaism. No historical proof is 
available, nor is there any evidence in the Arabian traditions, that some Arab 
tribe or prominent clan might have accepted Judaism. However, mention has been 
made of some individuals, who had become Jews. The Jews, however, were more 
interested in their trade and business than in the preaching of their religion. 
That is why Judaism did not spread as a religion and creed in Hejaz but remained 
only as a mark of pride and distinction of a few Israelite tribes. The Jewish 
rabbis, however, had a flourishing business in granting amulets and charms, 
fortune telling and sorcery, because of which they were held in great awe by the 
Arabs for their "knowledge" and practical wisdom.<br><br>Economically they were 
much stronger than the Arabs. Since they bad emigrated from more civilized and 
culturally advanced countries of Palestine and Syria, they knew many such arts 
as were unknown to the Arabs; they also enjoyed trade relations with the outside 
world. Hence, they had captured the business of importing grain in Yathrib and 
the upper Hejaz and exporting dried dates to other countries. Poultry farming 
and fishing also were mostly under their controls They were good at cloth 
weaving too. They had also set up wine shops here and there, where they sold 
wine which they imported from Syria. The Bani Qainuqa generally practiced crafts 
such as that of the goldsmith, blacksmith and vessel maker. In all these 
occupations, trade and business these Jews earned exorbitant profits, but their 
chief occupation was trading in money lending in which they had ensnared the 
Arabs of the surrounding areas. More particularly the chiefs and elders of the 
Arab tribes who were given to a life of pomp, bragging and boasting on the 
strength of borrowed money were deeply indebted to them. They lent money on high 
rates of interest and then would charge compound interest, which one could 
hardly clear off once one was involved in it. Thus, they had rendered the Arabs 
economically hollow, but it had naturally induced a deep rooted hatred among the 
common Arabs against the Jews.<br><br>The demand of their trade and economic 
interests was that they should neither estrange one Arab tribe by befriending 
another, nor take part in their mutual wars. But, on the other hand, it was also 
in their interests, that they should not allow the Arabs to be united and should 
keep them fighting and entrenched against each other, for they knew that 
whenever the Arab tribes united, they would not allow them to remain in 
possession of their 1large properties, gardens and fertile lands, which they had 
come to own through their profiteering and money lending business. Furthermore, 
each of their tribes also had to enter into alliance with one or another 
powerful Arab tribe for the sake of its own protection so that no other powerful 
tribe should overawe it by its might. Because of this they had not only to take 
part in the mutual wars of the Arabs but they often had to go to war in support 
of the Arab tribe to which their tribe was tied in alliance against another 
Jewish tribe which was allied to the enemy tribe. In Yathrib the Bani Quraizah 
and the Bani an-Nadir were the allies of the Aus while the Bani Qainuqa of the 
Khazraj. A little before the Holy Prophet's emigration, these Jewish tribes had 
confronted each other in support of their respective allies in the bloody war 
that took place between the Aus and the Khazraj at Buath.<br><br>Such were the 
conditions when Islam came to Madinah, and ultimately an Islamic State came into 
existence after the Holy Prophet's (upon whom be Allah's peace) arrival there. 
One of the first things that he accomplished soon after establishing this state 
was unification of the Aus and the Khazraj and the Emigrants into a brotherhood, 
and the second was that he concluded a treaty between the Muslims and the Jews 
on definite conditions, in which it was pledged that neither party would 
encroach on the rights of the other, and both would unite in a joint defense 
against the external enemies. Some important clauses of this treaty are as 
follows, which clearly show what the Jews and the Muslims had pledged to adhere 
to in their mutual relationship:<br><br>"The Jews must bear their expenses and 
the Muslims their expenses. Each must help the other against anyone who attacks 
the people of this document. They must seek mutual advice and consultation, and 
loyalty is a protection against treachery. They shall sincerely wish one another 
well. Their relations will be governed by piety and recognition of the rights of 
others, and not by sin and wrongdoing. The wronged must be helped. The Jews must 
pay with the believers so long as the war lasts. Yathrib shall be a sanctuary 
for the people of this document. If any dispute or controversy likely to cause 
trouble should arise, it must be referred to God and to Muhammad the Apostle of 
God; Quraish and their helpers shall not be given protection. The contracting 
parties are bound to help one another against any attack on Yathrib; Every one 
shall be responsible for the defense of the portion to which he belongs" (lbn 
Hisham, vol. ii, pp. 147 to 150).<br><br>This was on absolute and definitive 
covenant to the conditions of which the Jews themselves had agreed. But not very 
long after this they began to show hostility towards the Holy Prophet of Allah 
(upon whom be Allah's peace) and Islam and the Muslims, and their hostility and 
perverseness went on increasing day by day. Its main causes were three:<br><br>
First, they envisaged the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) merely as a 
chief of his people, who should be content to have concluded a political 
agreement with them and should only concern himself with the worldly interests 
of his group. But they found that he was extending an invitation to belief in 
Allah and the Prophethood and the Book (which also included belief in their own 
Prophets and scriptures), and was urging the people to give up disobedience of 
Allah and adopt obedience to the Divine Commands and abide by the moral laws of 
their own prophets. This they could not put up with. They feared that if this 
universal ideological movement gained momentum it would destroy their rigid 
religiosity and wipe out their racial nationhood.<br><br>Second, when they saw 
that the Aus and the Khazraj and the Emigrants were uniting into a brotherhood 
and the people from the Arab tribes of the surrounding areas, who entered Islam, 
were also joining this Islamic Brotherhood of Madinah and forming a religious 
community, they feared that the selfish policy that they had been following of 
sowing discord between the Arab tribes for the promotion of their own well being 
and interests for centuries, would not work in the new system, but they would 
face a united front of the Arabs against which their intrigues and machinations 
would not succeed.<br><br>Third, the work that the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon 
whom be Allah's 'peace) was carrying out of reforming the society and 
civilization included putting an end to all unlawful methods" in business and 
mutual dealings. More than that; he had declared taking and giving of interest 
also as impure and unlawful earning. This caused them the fear that if his rule 
became established in Arabia, he would declare interest legally forbidden, and 
in this they saw their own economic disaster and death.<br><br>For these reasons 
they made resistance and opposition to the Holy Prophet their national ideal. 
They would never hesitate to employ any trick and machination, any device and 
cunning, to harm him. They spread every kind of falsehood so as to cause 
distrust against him in the people's minds. They created every kind of doubt, 
suspicion and misgiving in the hearts of the new converts so as to turn them 
back from Islam. They would make false profession of Islam and then would turn 
apostate so that it may engender more and more misunderstandings among the 
people against Islam and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace). They 
would conspire with the hypocrites to create mischief and would cooperate with 
every group and tribe hostile to Islam. They would create rifts between the 
Muslims and would do whatever they could to stir them up to mutual feuds and 
fighting. The people of the Aus and the Khazraj tribes were their special 
target, with whom they had been allied for centuries. Making mention of the war 
of Buath before them they would remind them of their previous enmities so that 
they might again resort to the sword against each other and shatter their bond 
of fraternity into which Islam had bound them. They would resort to every kind 
of deceit and fraud in order to harm the Muslims economically. Whenever one of 
those with whom that had business dealings, would accept Islam, they would do 
whatever they could to cause him financial loss. If he owed them something they 
would worry and harass him by making repeated demands, and if they owed him 
something, they would withhold the payment and would publicly say that at the 
time the bargain was made he professed a different religion, and since he had 
changed his religion, they were no longer under any obligation towards him. 
Several instances of this nature have been cited in the explanation of verse 75 
of Surah Al Imran given in the commentaries by Tabari, Nisaburi, Tabrisi and in 
Ruh al Ma'ani.<br><br>They had adopted this hostile attitude against the 
covenant even before the Battle of Badr. But when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be 
Allah's peace) and the Muslims won a decisive victory over the Quraish at Badr, 
they were filled with grief and anguish, malice and anger. They were in fact 
anticipating that in that war the powerful Quraish would deal a death blow to 
the Muslims. That is why even before the news of the Islamic victory reached 
Madinah they had begun to spread the rumor that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be 
Allah's peace) had fallen a martyr and the Muslims had been routed, and the 
Quraish army under Abu Jahl was advancing on Madinah. But when the battle was 
decided against their hopes and wishes, they burst with anger and grief. Ka'b 
bin Ashraf, the chief of the Bani an-Nadir, cried out:"By God, if Muhammad has 
actually killed these nobles of Arabia, the earth's belly would be better for us 
than its back." Then he went to Makkah and incited the people to vengeance by 
writing and reciting provocative elegies for the Quraish chiefs killed at Badr. 
Then he returned to Madinah and composed lyrical verses of an insulting nature 
about the Muslim women. At last, enraged with his mischief, the Holy Prophet 
(upon whom be Allah's peace) sent Muhammad bin Maslamah Ansari in Rabi al-Awwal, 
A. H. 3, and had him slain. (Ibn Sad, Ibn Hisham, Tabari).<br><br>The first 
Jewish tribe which, after the Battle of Badr, openly and collectively broke 
their covenant were the Bani Qainuqa. They lived in a locality inside the city 
of Madinah. As they practiced the crafts of the goldsmith, blacksmith and vessel 
maker, the people of Madinah had to visit their shops fairly frequently. They 
were proud of their bravery and valor. Being blacksmiths by profession even 
their children were well armed, and they could instantly muster 700 fighting men 
from among themselves. They were also arrogantly aware that they enjoyed 
relations of confederacy with the Khazraj and Abdullah bin Ubbay, the chief of 
the, Khazraj, was their chief supporter. At the victory of Badr, they became so 
provoked that they began to trouble and harass the Muslims and their women in 
particular, who visited their shops. By and by things came to such a pass that 
one day a Muslim woman was stripped naked publicly in their bazaar. This led to 
a brawl in which a Muslim and a Jew were killed. Thereupon the Holy Prophet 
(upon whom be Allah's peace) himself visited their locality, got them together 
and counseled them on decent conduct. But the reply that they gave was; "O 
Muhammad, you perhaps think we are like the Quraish. They did not know fighting; 
therefore, you overpowered them. But when you come in contact with us, you will 
see how men fight." This was in clear words a declaration of war. Consequently, 
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) laid siege to their quarters 
towards the end of Shawwal (and according to some others, of Dhi Qa'dah) A. H. 
2. The siege had hardly lasted for a fortnight when they surrendered and all 
their fighting men were tied and taken prisoners. Now Abdullah bin Ubayy came up 
in support of them and insisted that they should be pardoned. The Holy Prophet 
conceded his request and decided that the Bani Qainuqa would be exiled from 
Madinah leaving their properties, armor and tools of trade behind. (Ibn Sa'd, 
Ibn Hisham, Tarikh Tabari).<br><br>For some time after these punitive measures 
(i. e. the banishment of the Qainuqa and killing of Ka'b bin Ashraf the Jews 
remained so terror stricken that they did not dare commit any further mischief. 
But later when in Shawwal, A. H. 3, the Quraish in order to avenge themselves 
for the defeat at Badr, marched against Madinah with great preparations, and the 
Jews saw that only a thousand men had marched out with the Holy Prophet (upon 
whom be Allah's peace) as against three thousand men of the Quraish, and even 
they were deserted by 300 hypocrites who returned to Madinah, they committed the 
first and open breach of the treaty by refusing to join the Holy Prophet in the 
defense of the city although they were bound to it. Then, when in the Battle of 
Uhud the Muslims suffered reverses, they were further emboldened. So much so 
that the Bani an-Nadir made a secret plan to kill the Holy Prophet (upon whom be 
Allah's peace) though the plan failed before it could be executed. According to 
the details, after the incident of Bi'r Maunah (Safar, A. H. 4) Amr bin Umayyah 
Damri slew by mistake two men of the Bani Amir in retaliation, who actually 
belonged to a tribe which was allied to the Muslims, but Amr had mistaken them 
for the men of the enemy. Because of this mistake their blood money became 
obligatory on the Muslims. Since the Bani an-Nadir were also a party in the 
alliance with the Bani Amir, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) went 
to their clan along with some of his Companions to ask for their help in paying 
the blood money. Outwardly they agreed to contribute, as he wished, but secretly 
they plotted that a person should go up to the top of the house by whose wall 
the Holy Prophet was sitting and drop a rock on him to kill him. But before they 
could execute their plan, he was informed in time and be immediately got up and 
returned to Madinah.<br><br>Now there was no question of showing them any 
further concession. The Holy Prophet at once sent to them the ultimatum that the 
treachery they had meditated against him had come to his knowledge; therefore, 
they were to leave Madinah within ten days; if anyone of them was found staying 
behind in their quarters, he would be put to the sword. Meanwhile Abdullah bin 
Ubayy sent them the message that he would help them with two thousand men and 
that the Bani Quraizah and Bani Ghatafan also would come to their aid; 
therefore, they should stand firm and should not go. On this false assurance 
they responded to the Holy Prophet's ultimatum saying that they would not leave 
Madinah and he could do whatever was in his power. Consequently, in Rabi' al-Awwal, 
A. H. 4, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) laid siege to them, and 
after a few days of the siege (which according to some traditions were 6 and 
according to others 15 days) they agreed to leave Madinah on the condition that 
they could retain all their property which they could carry on thee camels, 
except the armor. Thus, Madinah was rid of this second mischievous tribe of 
Jews. Only two of the Bani an-Nadir became Muslims and stayed behind. Others 
went to Syria and Khaiber.<br><br>This is the event that has been discussed in 
this Surah.<br>Theme and Subject Matter<br><br>The theme of the Surah as stated 
above, is an appraisal of the battle against the Bani an Nadir. In this, on the 
whole, four things have been discussed.<br><br>In the first four verses the 
world has been, admonished to take heed of the fate that had just befallen the 
Bani an-Nadir. A major tribe which was as strong in numbers as the Muslims, 
whose people boasted of far more wealth and possession who were by no means ill 
equipped militarily and whose forts were well fortified could not stand siege 
even for a few Days, and expressed their readiness to accept banishment from 
their centuries old, well established settlement even though not a single man 
from among them was slain. Allah says that this happened not because of any 
power possessed by the Muslims but because the Jews had tried to resist and 
fight Allah and His Messenger, and those who dare to resist the power of Allah, 
always meet with the same fate.<br><br>In verse 5, the rule of the law of war 
that has been enunciated is: the destruction caused in the enemy territory for 
military purposes does not come under "spreading mischief in the earth."<br><br>
In vv 6-10 it has been stated how the lands and properties which come under the 
control of the Islamic State as a result of war or peace terms, are to be 
managed. As it was the first ever occasion that the Muslims took control of a 
conquered territory, the law concerning it was laid down for their guidance.<br>
<br>In vv. 11-17 the attitude that the hypocrites had adopted on the occasion of 
the battle against the Bani an-Nadir has been reviewed and the causes underlying 
it have been pointed out.<br><br>The whole of the last section (vv. 18-24) is an 
admonition for all those people who had professed to have affirmed the faith and 
joined the Muslim community, but were devoid of the true spirit of the faith. In 
it they have been told what is the real demand of the Faith, what is the real 
difference between piety and wickedness, what is the place and importance of the 
Quran which they professed to believe in, and what are the attributes of God in 
Whom they claimed to have believed.<br></p>
