                  <li class="collection-item"> A (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:-</li><li class="collection-item"> Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, (as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him.</li><li class="collection-item"> And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith.</li><li class="collection-item"> (But the treaties are) not dissolved with those Pagans with whom ye have entered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor aided any one against you. So fulfil your engagements with them to the end of their term: for Allah loveth the righteous.</li><li class="collection-item"> But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah; and then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge.</li><li class="collection-item"> How can there be a league, before Allah and His Messenger, with the Pagans, except those with whom ye made a treaty near the sacred Mosque? As long as these stand true to you, stand ye true to them: for Allah doth love the righteous.</li><li class="collection-item"> How (can there be such a league), seeing that if they get an advantage over you, they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant? With (fair words from) their mouths they entice you, but their hearts are averse from you; and most of them are rebellious and wicked.</li><li class="collection-item"> The Signs of Allah have they sold for a miserable price, and (many) have they hindered from His way: evil indeed are the deeds they have done.</li><li class="collection-item"> In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who have transgressed all bounds.</li><li class="collection-item"> But (even so), if they repent, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity,- they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail, for those who understand.</li><li class="collection-item"> But if they violate their oaths after their covenant, and taunt you for your Faith,- fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith: for their oaths are nothing to them: that thus they may be restrained.</li><li class="collection-item"> Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the Messenger, and took the aggressive by being the first (to assault) you? Do ye fear them? Nay, it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear, if ye believe!</li><li class="collection-item"> Fight them, and Allah will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you (to victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers,</li><li class="collection-item"> And still the indignation of their hearts. For Allah will turn (in mercy) to whom He will; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Or think ye that ye shall be abandoned, as though Allah did not know those among you who strive with might and main, and take none for friends and protectors except Allah, His Messenger, and the (community of) Believers? But Allah is well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is not for such as join gods with Allah, to visit or maintain the mosques of Allah while they witness against their own souls to infidelity. The works of such bear no fruit: In Fire shall they dwell.</li><li class="collection-item"> The mosques of Allah shall be visited and maintained by such as believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity, and fear none (at all) except Allah. It is they who are expected to be on true guidance.</li><li class="collection-item"> Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque, equal to (the pious service of) those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and strive with might and main in the cause of Allah? They are not comparable in the sight of Allah: and Allah guides not those who do wrong.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who believe, and suffer exile and strive with might and main, in Allah´s cause, with their goods and their persons, have the highest rank in the sight of Allah: they are the people who will achieve (salvation).</li><li class="collection-item"> Their Lord doth give them glad tidings of a Mercy from Himself, of His good pleasure, and of gardens for them, wherein are delights that endure:</li><li class="collection-item"> They will dwell therein for ever. Verily in Allah´s presence is a reward, the greatest (of all).</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! take not for protectors your fathers and your brothers if they love infidelity above Faith: if any of you do so, they do wrong.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: If it be that your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your mates, or your kindred; the wealth that ye have gained; the commerce in which ye fear a decline: or the dwellings in which ye delight - are dearer to you than Allah, or His Messenger, or the striving in His cause;- then wait until Allah brings about His decision: and Allah guides not the rebellious.</li><li class="collection-item"> Assuredly Allah did help you in many battle-fields and on the day of Hunain: Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the land, for all that it is wide, did constrain you, and ye turned back in retreat.</li><li class="collection-item"> But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers, and sent down forces which ye saw not: He punished the Unbelievers; thus doth He reward those without Faith.</li><li class="collection-item"> Again will Allah, after this, turn (in mercy) to whom He will: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Truly the Pagans are unclean; so let them not, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Mosque. And if ye fear poverty, soon will Allah enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for Allah is All-knowing, All-wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.</li><li class="collection-item"> The Jews call ´Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah´s curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth!</li><li class="collection-item"> They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah, and (they take as their Lord) Christ the son of Mary; yet they were commanded to worship but One Allah: there is no god but He. Praise and glory to Him: (Far is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).</li><li class="collection-item"> Fain would they extinguish Allah´s light with their mouths, but Allah will not allow but that His light should be perfected, even though the Unbelievers may detest (it).</li><li class="collection-item"> It is He Who hath sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion, even though the Pagans may detest (it).</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! there are indeed many among the priests and anchorites, who in Falsehood devour the substance of men and hinder (them) from the way of Allah. And there are those who bury gold and silver and spend it not in the way of Allah: announce unto them a most grievous penalty-</li><li class="collection-item"> On the Day when heat will be produced out of that (wealth) in the fire of Hell, and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, their flanks, and their backs.- "This is the (treasure) which ye buried for yourselves: taste ye, then, the (treasures) ye buried!"</li><li class="collection-item"> The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve (in a year)- so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred: that is the straight usage. So wrong not yourselves therein, and fight the Pagans all together as they fight you all together. But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.</li><li class="collection-item"> Verily the transposing (of a prohibited month) is an addition to Unbelief: the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year, and forbidden another year, in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by Allah and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their course seems pleasing to them. But Allah guideth not those who reject Faith.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter.</li><li class="collection-item"> Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> If ye help not (your leader), (it is no matter): for Allah did indeed help him, when the Unbelievers drove him out: he had no more than one companion; they two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, "Have no fear, for Allah is with us": then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which ye saw not, and humbled to the depths the word of the Unbelievers. But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in might, Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Go ye forth, (whether equipped) lightly or heavily, and strive and struggle, with your goods and your persons, in the cause of Allah. That is best for you, if ye (but) knew.</li><li class="collection-item"> If there had been immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they would (all) without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, (and weighed) on them. They would indeed swear by Allah, "If we only could, we should certainly have come out with you": They would destroy their own souls; for Allah doth know that they are certainly lying.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah give thee grace! why didst thou grant them until those who told the truth were seen by thee in a clear light, and thou hadst proved the liars?</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day ask thee for no exemption from fighting with their goods and persons. And Allah knoweth well those who do their duty.</li><li class="collection-item"> Only those ask thee for exemption who believe not in Allah and the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so that they are tossed in their doubts to and fro.</li><li class="collection-item"> If they had intended to come out, they would certainly have made some preparation therefor; but Allah was averse to their being sent forth; so He made them lag behind, and they were told, "Sit ye among those who sit (inactive)."</li><li class="collection-item"> If they had come out with you, they would not have added to your (strength) but only (made for) disorder, hurrying to and fro in your midst and sowing sedition among you, and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them. But Allah knoweth well those who do wrong.</li><li class="collection-item"> Indeed they had plotted sedition before, and upset matters for thee, until,- the Truth arrived, and the Decree of Allah became manifest much to their disgust.</li><li class="collection-item"> Among them is (many) a man who says: "Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial." Have they not fallen into trial already? and indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers (on all sides).</li><li class="collection-item"> If good befalls thee, it grieves them; but if a misfortune befalls thee, they say, "We took indeed our precautions beforehand," and they turn away rejoicing.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector": and on Allah let the Believers put their trust.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Can you expect for us (any fate) other than one of two glorious things- (Martyrdom or victory)? But we can expect for you either that Allah will send his punishment from Himself, or by our hands. So wait (expectant); we too will wait with you."</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Spend (for the cause) willingly or unwillingly: not from you will it be accepted: for ye are indeed a people rebellious and wicked."</li><li class="collection-item"> The only reasons why their contributions are not accepted are: that they reject Allah and His Messenger; that they come to prayer without earnestness; and that they offer contributions unwillingly.</li><li class="collection-item"> Let not their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: in reality Allah´s plan is to punish them with these things in this life, and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> They swear by Allah that they are indeed of you; but they are not of you: yet they are afraid (to appear in their true colours).</li><li class="collection-item"> If they could find a place to flee to, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightaway thereto, with an obstinate rush.</li><li class="collection-item"> And among them are men who slander thee in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms: if they are given part thereof, they are pleased, but if not, behold! they are indignant!</li><li class="collection-item"> If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger gave them, and had said, "Sufficient unto us is Allah! Allah and His Messenger will soon give us of His bounty: to Allah do we turn our hopes!" (that would have been the right course).</li><li class="collection-item"> Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds); for those whose hearts have been (recently) reconciled (to Truth); for those in bondage and in debt; in the cause of Allah; and for the wayfarer: (thus is it) ordained by Allah, and Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> Among them are men who molest the Prophet and say, "He is (all) ear." Say, "He listens to what is best for you: he believes in Allah, has faith in the Believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe." But those who molest the Messenger will have a grievous penalty.</li><li class="collection-item"> To you they swear by Allah. In order to please you: But it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger, if they are Believers.</li><li class="collection-item"> Know they not that for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, is the Fire of Hell?- wherein they shall dwell. That is the supreme disgrace.</li><li class="collection-item"> The Hypocrites are afraid lest a Sura should be sent down about them, showing them what is (really passing) in their hearts. Say: "Mock ye! But verily Allah will bring to light all that ye fear (should be revealed).</li><li class="collection-item"> If thou dost question them, they declare (with emphasis): "We were only talking idly and in play." Say: "Was it at Allah, and His Signs, and His Messenger, that ye were mocking?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Make ye no excuses: ye have rejected Faith after ye had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you, for that they are in sin.</li><li class="collection-item"> The Hypocrites, men and women, (have an understanding) with each other: They enjoin evil, and forbid what is just, and are close with their hands. They have forgotten Allah; so He hath forgotten them. Verily the Hypocrites are rebellious and perverse.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah hath promised the Hypocrites men and women, and the rejecters, of Faith, the fire of Hell: Therein shall they dwell: Sufficient is it for them: for them is the curse of Allah, and an enduring punishment,-</li><li class="collection-item"> As in the case of those before you: they were mightier than you in power, and more flourishing in wealth and children. They had their enjoyment of their portion: and ye have of yours, as did those before you; and ye indulge in idle talk as they did. They!- their work are fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will lose (all spiritual good).</li><li class="collection-item"> Hath not the story reached them of those before them?- the People of Noah, and ´Ad, and Thamud; the People of Abraham, the men of Midian, and the cities overthrown. To them came their messengers with clear signs. It is not Allah Who wrongs them, but they wrong their own souls.</li><li class="collection-item"> The Believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just, and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, practise regular charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. On them will Allah pour His mercy: for Allah is Exalted in power, Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah hath promised to Believers, men and women, gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein, and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah: that is the supreme felicity.</li><li class="collection-item"> O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the Hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is Hell,- an evil refuge indeed.</li><li class="collection-item"> They swear by Allah that they said nothing (evil), but indeed they uttered blasphemy, and they did it after accepting Islam; and they meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out: this revenge of theirs was (their) only return for the bounty with which Allah and His Messenger had enriched them! If they repent, it will be best for them; but if they turn back (to their evil ways), Allah will punish them with a grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter: They shall have none on earth to protect or help them.</li><li class="collection-item"> Amongst them are men who made a covenant with Allah, that if He bestowed on them of His bounty, they would give (largely) in charity, and be truly amongst those who are righteous.</li><li class="collection-item"> But when He did bestow of His bounty, they became covetous, and turned back (from their covenant), averse (from its fulfilment).</li><li class="collection-item"> So He hath put as a consequence hypocrisy into their hearts, (to last) till the Day, whereon they shall meet Him: because they broke their covenant with Allah, and because they lied (again and again).</li><li class="collection-item"> Know they not that Allah doth know their secret (thoughts) and their secret counsels, and that Allah knoweth well all things unseen?</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who slander such of the believers as give themselves freely to (deeds of) charity, as well as such as can find nothing to give except the fruits of their labour,- and throw ridicule on them,- Allah will throw back their ridicule on them: and they shall have a grievous penalty.</li><li class="collection-item"> Whether thou ask for their forgiveness, or not, (their sin is unforgivable): if thou ask seventy times for their forgiveness, Allah will not forgive them: because they have rejected Allah and His Messenger: and Allah guideth not those who are perversely rebellious.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who were left behind (in the Tabuk expedition) rejoiced in their inaction behind the back of the Messenger of Allah: they hated to strive and fight, with their goods and their persons, in the cause of Allah: they said, "Go not forth in the heat." Say, "The fire of Hell is fiercer in heat." If only they could understand!</li><li class="collection-item"> Let them laugh a little: much will they weep: a recompense for the (evil) that they do.</li><li class="collection-item"> If, then, Allah bring thee back to any of them, and they ask thy permission to come out (with thee), say: "Never shall ye come out with me, nor fight an enemy with me: for ye preferred to sit inactive on the first occasion: Then sit ye (now) with those who lag behind."</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor do thou ever pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave; for they rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died in a state of perverse rebellion.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor let their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: Allah´s plan is to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> When a Sura comes down, enjoining them to believe in Allah and to strive and fight along with His Messenger, those with wealth and influence among them ask thee for exemption, and say: "Leave us (behind): we would be with those who sit (at home)."</li><li class="collection-item"> They prefer to be with (the women), who remain behind (at home): their hearts are sealed and so they understand not.</li><li class="collection-item"> But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah hath prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein: that is the supreme felicity.</li><li class="collection-item"> And there were, among the desert Arabs (also), men who made excuses and came to claim exemption; and those who were false to Allah and His Messenger (merely) sat inactive. Soon will a grievous penalty seize the Unbelievers among them.</li><li class="collection-item"> There is no blame on those who are infirm, or ill, or who find no resources to spend (on the cause), if they are sincere (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger: no ground (of complaint) can there be against such as do right: and Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor (is there blame) on those who came to thee to be provided with mounts, and when thou saidst, "I can find no mounts for you," they turned back, their eyes streaming with tears of grief that they had no resources wherewith to provide the expenses.</li><li class="collection-item"> The ground (of complaint) is against such as claim exemption while they are rich. They prefer to stay with the (women) who remain behind: Allah hath sealed their hearts; so they know not (What they miss).</li><li class="collection-item"> They will present their excuses to you when ye return to them. Say thou: "Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: Allah hath already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you: It is your actions that Allah and His Messenger will observe: in the end will ye be brought back to Him Who knoweth what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did."</li><li class="collection-item"> They will swear to you by Allah, when ye return to them, that ye may leave them alone. So leave them alone: For they are an abomination, and Hell is their dwelling-place,-a fitting recompense for the (evil) that they did.</li><li class="collection-item"> They will swear unto you, that ye may be pleased with them but if ye are pleased with them, Allah is not pleased with those who disobey.</li><li class="collection-item"> The Arabs of the desert are the worst in Unbelief and hypocrisy, and most fitted to be in ignorance of the command which Allah hath sent down to His Messenger: But Allah is All-knowing, All-Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Some of the desert Arabs look upon their payments as a fine, and watch for disasters for you: on them be the disaster of evil: for Allah is He That heareth and knoweth (all things).</li><li class="collection-item"> But some of the desert Arabs believe in Allah and the Last Day, and look on their payments as pious gifts bringing them nearer to Allah and obtaining the prayers of the Messenger. Aye, indeed they bring them nearer (to Him): soon will Allah admit them to His Mercy: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> The vanguard (of Islam)- the first of those who forsook (their homes) and of those who gave them aid, and (also) those who follow them in (all) good deeds,- well-pleased is Allah with them, as are they with Him: for them hath He prepared gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever: that is the supreme felicity.</li><li class="collection-item"> Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites, as well as (desert Arabs) among the Medina folk: they are obstinate in hypocrisy: thou knowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish them: and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous penalty.</li><li class="collection-item"> Others (there are who) have acknowledged their wrong-doings: they have mixed an act that was good with another that was evil. Perhaps Allah will turn unto them (in Mercy): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> Of their goods, take alms, that so thou mightest purify and sanctify them; and pray on their behalf. Verily thy prayers are a source of security for them: And Allah is One Who heareth and knoweth.</li><li class="collection-item"> Know they not that Allah doth accept repentance from His votaries and receives their gifts of charity, and that Allah is verily He, the Oft-Returning, Most Merciful?</li><li class="collection-item"> And say: "Work (righteousness): Soon will Allah observe your work, and His Messenger, and the Believers: Soon will ye be brought back to the knower of what is hidden and what is open: then will He show you the truth of all that ye did."</li><li class="collection-item"> There are (yet) others, held in suspense for the command of Allah, whether He will punish them, or turn in mercy to them: and Allah is All-Knowing, Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> And there are those who put up a mosque by way of mischief and infidelity - to disunite the Believers - and in preparation for one who warred against Allah and His Messenger aforetime. They will indeed swear that their intention is nothing but good; But Allah doth declare that they are certainly liars.</li><li class="collection-item"> Never stand thou forth therein. There is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety; it is more worthy of the standing forth (for prayer) therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and Allah loveth those who make themselves pure.</li><li class="collection-item"> Which then is best? - he that layeth his foundation on piety to Allah and His good pleasure? - or he that layeth his foundation on an undermined sand-cliff ready to crumble to pieces? and it doth crumble to pieces with him, into the fire of Hell. And Allah guideth not people that do wrong.</li><li class="collection-item"> The foundation of those who so build is never free from suspicion and shakiness in their hearts, until their hearts are cut to pieces. And Allah is All-Knowing, Wise.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur´an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those that turn (to Allah) in repentance; that serve Him, and praise Him; that wander in devotion to the cause of Allah,: that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer; that enjoin good and forbid evil; and observe the limit set by Allah;- (These do rejoice). So proclaim the glad tidings to the Believers.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is not fitting, for the Prophet and those who believe, that they should pray for forgiveness for Pagans, even though they be of kin, after it is clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.</li><li class="collection-item"> And Abraham prayed for his father´s forgiveness only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allah, he dissociated himself from him: for Abraham was most tender-hearted, forbearing.</li><li class="collection-item"> And Allah will not mislead a people after He hath guided them, in order that He may make clear to them what to fear (and avoid)- for Allah hath knowledge of all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> Unto Allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He giveth life and He taketh it. Except for Him ye have no protector nor helper.</li><li class="collection-item"> Allah turned with favour to the Prophet, the Muhajirs, and the Ansar,- who followed him in a time of distress, after that the hearts of a part of them had nearly swerved (from duty); but He turned to them (also): for He is unto them Most Kind, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> (He turned in mercy also) to the three who were left behind; (they felt guilty) to such a degree that the earth seemed constrained to them, for all its spaciousness, and their (very) souls seemed straitened to them,- and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah (and no refuge) but to Himself. Then He turned to them, that they might repent: for Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! Fear Allah and be with those who are true (in word and deed).</li><li class="collection-item"> It was not fitting for the people of Medina and the Bedouin Arabs of the neighbourhood, to refuse to follow Allah´s Messenger, nor to prefer their own lives to his: because nothing could they suffer or do, but was reckoned to their credit as a deed of righteousness,- whether they suffered thirst, or fatigue, or hunger, in the cause of Allah, or trod paths to raise the ire of the Unbelievers, or received any injury whatever from an enemy: for Allah suffereth not the reward to be lost of those who do good;-</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor could they spend anything (for the cause) - small or great- nor cut across a valley, but the deed is inscribed to their credit: that Allah may requite their deed with the best (possible reward).</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor should the Believers all go forth together: if a contingent from every expedition remained behind, they could devote themselves to studies in religion, and admonish the people when they return to them,- that thus they (may learn) to guard themselves (against evil).</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye who believe! fight the unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him.</li><li class="collection-item"> Whenever there cometh down a sura, some of them say: "Which of you has had His faith increased by it?" Yea, those who believe,- their faith is increased and they do rejoice.</li><li class="collection-item"> But those in whose hearts is a disease,- it will add doubt to their doubt, and they will die in a state of Unbelief.</li><li class="collection-item"> See they not that they are tried every year once or twice? Yet they turn not in repentance, and they take no heed.</li><li class="collection-item"> Whenever there cometh down a Sura, they look at each other, (saying), "Doth anyone see you?" Then they turn aside: Allah hath turned their hearts (from the light); for they are a people that understand not.</li><li class="collection-item"> Now hath come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves: it grieves him that ye should perish: ardently anxious is he over you: to the Believers is he most kind and merciful.</li><li class="collection-item"> But if they turn away, Say: "Allah sufficeth me: there is no god but He: On Him is my trust,- He the Lord of the Throne (of Glory) Supreme!"</li>

<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>This Surah is known by two names -- At-Taubah 
and Al-Bara'at. It is called At-Taubah because it enunciates the nature of 
taubah (repentance) and mentions the conditions of its acceptance.(vv. 102. 
118). The second name Bara'at (Release) is taken from the first word of the 
Surah.<br><br><strong>Omission of Bismillah</strong><br><br>This is the only 
Surah of the Quran to which Bismillah is not prefixed. Though the commentators 
have given different reasons for this, the correct one that which has been given 
by Imam Razi: namely,this is because the Holy Prophet himself did not dictate it 
at the beginning of the Surah. Therefore the Companions did not prefix it and 
their successors followed them., This is a further proof of the fact that utmost 
care has been taken to keep the Quran intact so that it should remain in its 
complete and original form.<br><br><strong>Discourses and Periods of Revelation</strong><br>
<br>This Surah comprises three discourses:-<br><br>The first discourse (vv. 
1-37), was revealed in Zil-Qa'adah A.H. 9 or thereabout. As the importance of 
the subject of the discourse required its declaration on the occasion of Haj the 
Holy Prophet dispatched Hadrat Ali to follow Hadrat Abu Bakr, who had already 
left for Makkah as leader of the Pilgrims to the Ka'abah. He instructed Hadrat 
Ali to deliver the discourse before the representatives of the different clans 
of Arabia so as to inform them of the new policy towards the mushriks.<br><br>
The second discourse (vv., 38-72) was sent down in Rajab A.H. 9 or a little 
before this, when the Holy Prophet was engaged in making preparations for the 
Campaign, of Tabuk. In this discourse, the Believers were urged to take active 
part in Jihad, and the shirkers were severely rebuked for holding back their 
wealth and for hesitation to sacrifice their lives in the way of Allah because 
of their hypocrisy, weak faith or negligence.<br><br>The third discourse (vv. 
73-129) was revealed on his return from the Campaign of Tabuk. There are some 
pieces in this discourse that were sent down on different occasions during the 
same period and were afterwards consolidated by the Holy Prophet into the Surah 
in accordance with inspiration from Allah. But this caused no interruption in 
its continuity because they dealt with the same subject and formed part of the 
same series of events. This discourse warns the hypocrites of their evil deeds 
and rebukes those Believers who had stayed behind in the Campaign of Tabuk. Then 
after taking them to task, Allah pardons those true Believers who had not taken 
part in the Jihad in the Way of Allah for one reason or the other.<br><br>
Chronologically, the first discourse should have come last; but being the most 
important of the three in regard to its subject matter, it was placed first in 
the order of compilation.<br><br><strong>Historical Background</strong><br><br>
Now let us consider the historical background of the Surah. The series of events 
that have been discussed in this Surah took place after the Peace Treaty of 
Hudaibiyah. By that time, one-third of Arabia had come under the sway of Islam 
which had established itself as a powerful, well organized and civilized Islamic 
State. This Treaty afforded further opportunities to Islam to spread its 
influence in the comparatively peaceful atmosphere created by it. After this 
Treaty, two events took place, which led to very important results:<br><br>
<strong>Conquest of Arabia</strong><br><br>The first was the Conquest of Arabia. 
The Holy Prophet was able to send missions among different clans for the 
propagation of Islam. The result was that during the short period of two years, 
it became such a great power that it made the old order of ignorance' feel 
helpless before it. So much so that the zealous elements from among the Quraish 
were so exasperated that they broke the Treaty in order to encounter Islam in a 
decisive combat. But the Holy Prophet took prompt action after the breach so as 
not to allow them any opportunity to gather enough force for this. He made a 
sudden invasion on Makkah in the month of Ramadan in A. H. 8 and conquered it. 
Though this conquest broke the backbone of the order of ignorance, it made still 
another attack on Islam in the battle-field of Hunain, which proved to be its 
death-knell. The clans of Hawazin Thaqif, Naur, Jushm and others gathered their 
entire forces in the battle field in order to crush the reformative Revolution, 
but they utterly failed in their evil designs. The defeat of 'ignorance' at 
Hunain paved the way for making the whole of Arabia the 'Abode of Islam' (Dar-ul-Islam). 
The result was that hardly a year had Passed after the Battle of Hunain, when 
the major portion of Arabia came within the fold of Islam and only a few 
upholders of the old order remained scattered over some corners of the country.<br>
<br>The second event that contributed towards making Islam a formidable power 
was the Campaign of Tabuk, which was necessitated by the provocative activities 
of the Christians living within or near the boundaries of the Roman Empire to 
the north of Arabia. Accordingly, the Holy Prophet, with an army of thirty 
thousand marched boldly towards the Roman Empire but the Romans evaded the 
encounter. The result was that the power of the Holy Prophet and Islam increased 
manifold and deputations from all corners of Arabia began to wait upon him on 
his return from Tabuk in order to offer their allegiance to Islam and obedience 
to him. The Holy Quran has described this triumph in Surah An-Nasr: "When the 
succor of Allah came and victory was attained and you saw people entering the 
fold of Islam in large numbers...<br><br><strong>Campaign to Tabuk</strong><br>
<br>The Campaign to Tabuk was the result of conflict with the Roman Empire, that 
had started even before the conquest of Makkah. One of the missions sent after 
the Treaty of Hudaibiyah to different parts of Arabia visited the clans which 
lived in the northern areas adjacent to Syria. The majority of these people were 
Christians, who were under the influence of the Roman Empire. Contrary to all 
the principles of the commonly accepted international law, they killed fifteen 
members of the delegation near a place known as Zat-u-Talah (or Zat-i-Itlah). 
Only Ka'ab bin Umair Ghifari, the head of the delegation, succeeded in escaping 
and reporting the sad incident. Besides this, Shurahbll bin Amr, the Christian 
governor of Busra, who was directly under the Roman Caesar, had also put to 
death Haritli bin Umair, the ambassador of the Holy Prophet, who had been sent 
to him on a similar minion.<br><br>These events convinced the Holy Prophet that 
a strong action should be taken in order to make the territory adjacent to the 
Roman Empire safe and secure for the Muslims. Accordingly, in the month of 
Jamadi-ul-Ula A. H. 8, he sent an army of three thousand towards the Syrian 
border. When this army reached near Ma'an, the Muslims learned that Shurahbil 
was marching with an army of one hundred thousand to fight-with them and that 
the Caesar, who himself was at Hims, had sent another army consisting of one 
hundred thousand soldiers under his brother Theodore. But in spite of such 
fearful news, the brave small band of the Muslims marched on fearlessly and 
encountered the big army of Shurahbil at M'utah. And the result of the encounter 
in which the Muslims were fighting against fearful odds (the ratio of the two 
armies was 1:33), as very favorable, for the enemy utterly failed to defeat 
them. This proved very helpful for the propagation of Islam. As a result, those 
Arabs who were living in a state of semi independence in Syria and near Syria 
and the clans of Najd near Iraq, who were under the influence of the Iranian 
Empire, turned towards Islam and embraced it in thousands. For example, the 
people of Bani Sulaim (whose chief was Abbas bin Mirdas Sulaimi), Ashja'a, 
Ghatafan, Zubyan, Fazarah, etc., came into the fold of Islam at the same time. 
Above all, Farvah bin 'Amral Juzami, who was the commander of the Arab armies of 
the Roman Empire, embraced Islam during that time, and underwent the trial of 
his Faith in a way that filled the whole territory with wonder. When the Caesar 
came to know that Farvah had embraced Islam, he ordered that he should be 
arrested and brought to his court. Then the Caesar said to him, "You will have 
to choose one of the two things. Either give up your Islam and win your liberty 
and your former rank, or remain a Muslim and face death." He calmly chose Islam 
and sacrificed his life in the way of the Truth.<br><br>No wonder that such 
events as these made the Caesar realize the nature of the danger that was 
threatening his Empire from Arabia. Accordingly, in 9 A.H. he began to make 
military preparations to avenge the insult he had suffered at M'utah. The 
Ghassanid and other Arab chiefs also began to muster armies under him. When the 
Holy Prophet, who always kept himself well-informed even of the minutest things 
that could affect the Islamic Movement favorably or adversely, came to know of 
these preparations, he at once under- stood their meaning. Therefore, without 
the least hesitation he decided to fight against the great power of the Caesar. 
He knew that the show of the slightest weakness would result in the utter 
failure of the Movement which was facing three great dangers at that time. First 
the dying power of 'ignorance' that had almost been crushed in the battle-field 
of Hunain might revive again. Secondly, the Hypocrites of Al: Madinah, who were 
always on the look-out for such an opportunity, might make full use of this to 
do the greatest possible harm to it. For they had already made preparations for 
this and had, through a monk called Abu Amir, sent secret messages of their evil 
designs to the Christian king of Ghassan and the Caesar himself. Besides this, 
they had also built a mosque near Al-Madinah for holding secret meetings for 
this purpose. The third danger was of an attack by the Caesar himself, who had 
already defeated Iran, the other great power of that period, and filled with awe 
the adjacent territories.<br><br>It is obvious that if all these three elements 
had been given an opportunity of taking a concerted action against the Muslims, 
Islam would have lost the fight it had almost won. That is why in this case the 
Holy Prophet made an open declaration for making preparations for the Campaign 
against the Roman Empire, which was one of the two greatest empires of the world 
of that period. The declaration was made though all the apparent circumstances 
were against such a decision: for there was famine in the country and the long 
awaited crops were about to ripen: the burning heat of the scorching summer 
season of Arabia was at, its height and there was not enough money for 
preparations in general, and for equipment and conveyance in particular. But in 
spite of these handicaps, when the Messenger of Allah realized the urgency of 
the occasion, he took this step which was to decide whether the Mission of the 
Truth was going to survive or perish. The very fact that he made an open 
declaration for making preparations for such a campaign to Syria against the 
Roman Empire showed how important it was, for this was contrary to his previous 
practice. Usually he took every precaution not to reveal beforehand the 
direction to which he was going nor the name of the enemy whom he was going to 
attack; nay, he did not move out of Al-Madinah even in the direction of the 
campaign.<br><br>All the parties in Arabia fully realized the grave consequences 
of this critical decision. The remnants of the lovers of the old order of 
'ignorance' were anxiously waiting for the result of the Campaign, for they had 
pinned all their hopes on the defeat of Islam by the Romans. The 'hypocrites' 
also considered it to be their last chance of crushing the power of Islam by 
internal rebellion, if the Muslims suffered a defeat in Syria. They had, 
therefore, made full use of the Mosque built by them for hatching plots and had 
employed all their devices to render the Campaign a failure. On the other side, 
the true Believers also realized fully that the fate of the Movement for which 
they had been exerting their utmost for the last 22 years was now hanging in the 
balance. If they showed courage on that critical occasion, the doors of the 
whole outer world would be thrown open for the Movement to spread. But if they 
showed weakness or cowardice, then all the work they had done in Arabia would 
-end in smoke.<br><br>That is why these lovers of Islam began to make 
enthusiastic preparations for the Campaign. Everyone of them tried to surpass 
the other in making contributions for the provision of equipment for it. Hadrat 
Uthman and Hadrat Abdur Rehman bin Auf presented large sums of money for this 
purpose. Hadrat Umar contributed half of the earnings of his life and Hadrat Abu 
Bakr the entire earnings of his life. The indigent Companions did not lag behind 
and presented whatever they could earn by the sweat of their labor and the women 
parted with their ornaments. Thousands of volunteers, who were filled with the 
desire of sacrificing their lives for Islam, came to the Holy Prophet and 
requested that arrangements for weapons and conveyance be made for them so that 
they should join the expedition. Those who could not be provided with these shed 
tears of sorrow; the scene was so pathetic that it made the Holy Prophet sad 
because of his inability to arm them. In short, the occasion became the 
touchstone for discriminating a true believer from a hypocrite. For, to lag 
behind in the Campaign meant that the very relationship of a person to Islam was 
doubtful. Accordingly, whenever a person lagged behind during the journey to 
Tabuk, the Holy Prophet, on being informed, would spontaneously say, "Leave him 
alone. If there be any good in him, Allah will again join him with you, and if 
there be no good in him, then thank Allah that He relieved you of his evil 
company".<br><br>In short, the Holy Prophet marched out towards Syria in Rajab 
A. H. 9, with thirty thousand fighters for the cause of Islam. The conditions in 
which the expedition was undertaken may be judged from the fact that the number 
of camels with them was so small that many of them were obliged to walk on foot 
and to wait for their turns for several had to ride at a time on each camel. To 
add to this, there was the burning heat of the desert and the acute shortage of 
water. But they were richly rewarded for their firm resolve and sincere 
adherence to the cause and for their perseverance in the face of those great 
difficulties and obstacles.<br><br>When they arrived at Tabuk, they learned that 
the Caesar and his allies had withdrawn their troops from the frontier and there 
was no enemy to fight with. Thus they won a moral victory that increased their 
prestige manifold and, that too, without shedding a drop of blood.<br><br>In 
this connection, it is pertinent to point out that the general impression given 
by the historians of the campaigns of the Holy Prophet about the Campaign of 
Tabuk is not correct. They relate the event in a way as if the news of the 
mustering of the Roman armies near the Arabian frontier was itself false. The 
fact is that the Caesar had begun to muster his armies, but the Holy Prophet 
forestalled him and arrived on the scene before he could make full preparations 
for the invasion. Therefore, believing that "discretion is the better part of 
valor," he withdrew his armies from the frontier. For he had not forgotten that 
the three thousand fighters for the cause of Islam had rendered helpless his 
army one hundred thousand strong at M'utah. He could not, therefore, even with 
an army of two hundred thousand, dare to fight against an army of thirty 
thousand, and that, too, under the leadership of the Holy Prophet himself.<br>
<br>When the Holy Prophet found that the Caesar had withdrawn his forces from 
the frontier, he considered thee question whether it would be worthwhile to 
march into the Syrian territory or to halt at Tabuk and turn his moral victory 
to political and strategical advantage. He decided on the latter course and made 
a halt for twenty days at Tabuk. During this time, he brought pressure on the 
small states that lay between the Roman Empire and the Islamic State and were at 
that time under the influence of the Romans, and subdued and made them the 
tributaries of the Islamic State. For instance, some Christian chiefs Ukaidir 
bin Abdul Malik Kindi of Dumatul Jaiidal, Yuhanna bin D'obah of Allah, and the 
chiefs of Maqna, Jarba' and Azruh also submitted and agreed to pay Jizyah to the 
Islamic State of Al- Madinah. As a result of this, the boundaries of the Islamic 
State were extended right up to the Roman Empire, and the majority of the Arab 
clans, who were being used by the Caesar against Arabia, became the allies of 
the Muslims against the Romans.<br><br>Above all, this moral victory of Tabuk 
afforded a golden opportunity to the Muslims to strengthen their hold on Arabia 
before entering into a long conflict with the Romans. For it broke the back of 
those who had still been expecting that the old order of 'ignorance' might 
revive in the near future, whether they were the open upholders of shirk or the 
hypocrites who were hiding their shirk under the garb of Islam. The majority of 
such people were compelled by the force of circumstances to enter into the fold 
of Islam and, at least, make it possible for their descendants to become true 
Muslims. After this a mere impotent minority of the upholders of the old order 
was left in the field, but it could not stand in the way of the Islamic 
Revolution for the perfection of which Allah had sent His Messenger.<br><br>
<strong>Problems of the Period</strong><br><br>If we keep in view the preceding 
background, we can easily find out the problems that were confronting the 
Community at that time. They were:<br><br>to make the whole of Arabia a perfect 
Dar-ul-Islam,<br><br>to extend the influence of Islam to the adjoining 
countries,<br><br>to crush the mischiefs of the hypocrites, and<br><br>to 
prepare the Muslims for Jihad against the non- Muslim world.<br><br>Now that the 
administration of the whole of Arabia had come in the hands of the Believers, 
and all the opposing powers had become helpless, it was necessary to make a 
clear declaration of that policy which was to be adopted to make her a perfect 
Dar-ul-Islam. Therefore the following measures were adopted:<br><br>A clear 
declaration was made that all the treaties with the mushriks were abolished and 
the Muslims would be released from the treaty obligations with them after a 
respite of four months.(vv. 1-3). This declaration was necessary for uprooting 
completely the system of life based on shirk and to make Arabia exclusively the 
center of Islam so that it should not in any way interfere with the spirit of 
Islam nor become an internal danger for it.<br><br>A decree was issued that the 
guardianship of the Ka`abah, which held central position in all the affairs of 
Arabia, should be wrested from the mushriks and placed permanently in the hands 
of the Believers, (vv. 12-18) that all the customs and practices of the shirk of 
the era of 'ignorance' should be forcibly abolished: that the mushriks should 
not be allowed even to come near the "House" (v. 28). This was to eradicate 
every trace of shirk from the "House" that was dedicated exclusively to the 
worship of Allah.<br><br>The evil practice of Nasi, by which they used to tamper 
with the sacred months in the days of 'ignorance', was forbidden as an act of 
kufr(v. 37). This was also to serve as an example to the Muslims for eradicating 
every vestige of the customs of ignorance from the life of Arabia (and 
afterwards from the lives of the Muslims everywhere).<br><br>In order to enable 
the Muslims to extend the influence of Islam outside Arabia, they were enjoined 
to crush with sword the non- Muslim powers and to force them to accept the 
sovereignty of the Islamic State. As the great Roman and Iranian Empires were 
the biggest hindrances in the way, a conflict with them was inevitable. The 
object of Jihad was not to coerce them to accept Islam they were free to accept 
or not to accept it-but to prevent them from thrusting forcibly their deviations 
upon others and the coming generations. The Muslims were enjoined to tolerate 
their misguidance only to the extent that they might have the freedom to remain 
misguided, if they chose to be so, provided that they paid Jizyah (v. 29) as a 
sign of their subjugation to the Islamic State.<br><br>The third important 
problem was to crush the mischiefs of the hypocrites, who had hitherto been 
tolerated in spite of their flagrant crimes. Now that there was practically no 
pressure upon them from outside, the Muslims were enjoined to treat them openly 
as disbelievers (v. 73). Accordingly, the Holy Prophet set on fire the house of 
Swailim, where the hypocrites used to gather for consultations in order to 
dissuade the people from joining the expedition to Tabuk. Likewise on his return 
from Tabuk, he ordered to pull down and burn the 'Mosque' that had been built to 
serve as a cover for the hypocrites for hatching plots against the true 
Believers.<br><br>In order to prepare the Muslims for Jihad against the whole 
non-Muslim world, it was necessary to cure them even of that slight weakness of 
faith from which they were still suffering. For there could be no greater 
internal danger to the Islamic Community than the weakness of faith, especially 
where it was going to engage itself single-handed in a' conflict with the whole 
non-Muslim world. That is why those people who had lagged behind in the Campaign 
to Tabuk or had shown the least negligence were severely taken to task, and were 
considered as hypocrites if they had no plausible excuse for not fulfilling that 
obligation. Moreover, a clear declaration was made that in future the sole 
criterion of a Muslim's faith shall be the exertions he makes for the uplift of 
the Word of Allah and the role he plays in the conflict between Islam and kufr. 
Therefore, if anyone will show any hesitation in sacrificing his life, money, 
time and energies, his faith shall not be regarded as genuine. (vv. 81-96).<br>
<br>If the above-mentioned important points are kept in view during the study of 
this Surah, it will facilitate the understanding of its contents.<br><br>
<strong>Subject: Problems of Peace and War</strong><br><br>In continuation of 
Surah Al-Anfal, this Surah also deals with the problems of peace and war and 
bases the theme on the Tabuk Expedition.<br><br><strong>Topics and their 
Interconnection</strong><br><br>This portion deals with the sanctity of treaties 
and lays down principles, rules and regulations which must be kept in view 
before breaking them, in case the other party does not observe them sincerely. 1 
- 12<br><br>In this portion the Muslims have been urged to fight in the Way of 
Allah with the mushrik Arabs, the Jews and the Christians, who were duly warned 
of the consequences of their mischievous and inimical behavior. 13 - 37<br><br>
In this discourse, the Muslims have been told clearly and explicitly that they 
will inherit the rewards promised by Allah only if they take active part in the 
conflict with kufr, for that is the criterion which distinguishes true Muslims 
from hypocrites. Therefore true Muslims should take active part in Jihad, 
without minding dangers, obstacles, difficulties, temptations and the like. 38 - 
72<br><br>This portion deals with the problems of hypocrites and lays down rules 
and regulations governing the treatment that should be meted out to them and 
points out their distinctive marks from true Muslims. 73 - 90<br><br>This 
portion deals with the case of those who remained behind and did not accompany 
the Holy Prophet for Jihad to Tabuk. For this purpose they have been separated 
in different categories, that is, the disabled, the sick, the indigent, the 
hypocrites, the believers who realized their guilt and punished themselves 
before the return of the Holy Prophet from Tabuk and those who confessed their 
error. Their cases have been dealt with in accordance with the nature and extent 
of their offense. 91 - 110<br><br>In order to make their noble qualities look 
all the more conspicuous and dignified by contrast, the characteristics of the 
Believers have been mentioned, and they have been reassured that Allah, the 
Sovereign of the Universe, is their helper and guardian. Accordingly, because of 
their sincerity, He has forgiven the Three Believers who did not take part in 
the expedition. 111 - 118<br><br>In the concluding portion, general instructions 
have been given to the Believers for their guidance. 119 - 127<br><br>This is 
the conclusion: "Follow the Messenger who is gentle and compassionate and your 
greatest well-wisher, and trust in Allah, the Lord of the Universe". 128 - 129</p>
<hr>
<p>1As has already been stated in the Preface to this Surah, this discourse (vv. 
1-37) was revealed in A.H. 9, when Hadrat Abu Bakr had left for Makkah as leader 
of the pilgrims to the Ka`abah. Therefore the Companions said to the Holy 
Prophet, "Sir, send it to Abu Bakr so that he may proclaim it on the occasion of 
Haj. " He replied, "The importance and nature of the Declaration demands that 
this should be proclaimed on my behalf by some one from my own family." 
Accordingly, he entrusted this duty to Hadrat 'Ali and instructed him to 
proclaim it openly before the pilgrims, and also make these four announcements: 
(1) "No one who rejects Islam shall enter Paradise. (2) No mushrik should 
perform Haj after this. (3) It is forbidden to move round the Ka`abah in a naked 
state. (4) The terms of the treaties which are still in force (i.e. with those 
who have not broken their treaties with the Messenger of Allah up to that time) 
would be faithfully observed till the expiry of the term of the treaties".<br>
<br>In this connection, it will be worthwhile to know that the first Haj of the 
Islamic period after the conquest of Makkah was performed in A.H. 8, according 
to the old customs. Then in A.H. 9 the second Haj was performed by the Muslims 
in the Islamic way, and by the mushriks in their own way. But the third Haj, 
known as "Hajja-tul-Wida a", was performed in A.H. 10 in the purely Islamic way 
under the guidance of the Holy Prophet himself. He did not perform Haj during 
the two previous years because up to that time the mushriks had not been 
forbidden from it, and so there were still some traces of shirk associated with 
it. <br><br>2This declaration of the abrogation of the treaties with the 
mushriks was made in accordance with the law enjoined in VIII: 58 regarding the 
treacherous people, for it is treachery from the Islamic point of view to wage 
war against any people with whom a treaty of peace had been made, without openly 
declaring that the treaty had been terminated. That is why a proclamation of the 
abrogation of the treaties was necessitated against those clans who were always 
hatching plots against Islam in spice of the treaties of peace they had made. 
They would break the treaties and turn hostile on the first opportunity for 
treachery, and the same was true of all the mushrik clans with the exception of 
Bani Kananah, Bani Damrah and one or two other clans.<br><br>This proclamation 
practically reduced the mushriks of Arabia to the position of outlaws and no 
place of shelter was left for them, for the major part of the country had come 
under the sway of Islam. As this released the Muslims from the obligations of 
the treaties made with them and forestalled them, they were driven into a tight 
comer. For this smashed all their evil designs of creating trouble by inciting 
civil war at the time of a threat from the Roman and the Iranian Empires or 
after the death of the Holy Prophet. But Allah and His Messenger turned the 
tables on them before the opportune moment for which they were waiting. Now the 
only alternatives left with them were either to accept Islam that had become the 
state religion of Arabia, or to fight against it and be exterminated, or to 
emigrate from the country.<br><br>The wisdom of this grand plan became apparent 
when the mischief of apostasy broke out in different parts of Arabia a year and 
a half after this at the death of the Holy Prophet. This disturbance was so 
sudden and violent that it shook to its foundations, the newly created Islamic 
State, and would have done a far greater harm if the organized power of shirk 
had not been broken beforehand by this abrogation. It may be asserted that but 
for this timely action the mischief of apostasy, that rose at the very beginning 
of the Caliphate of Hadrat Abu Bakr, would have done ten-fold harm by rebellion 
and civil war, and might have changed the whole history of Islam. <br><br>3The 
respite of four months from the tenth of Zil-Haj (the date of the proclamation) 
to the tenth of Rabi'-uth-thani; was granted to give time to the mushriks so 
that they should consider their position carefully and decide whether to make 
preparation for war or to emigrate from the country or to accept Islam.<br><br>
4Hajj-i-akbar refers to the 10th of Zil-Hajjah and is also known as Yaum-un-Nahr. 
This has been explained by the Holy Prophet in an authentic Tradition. On the 
10th of Zil-Hajjah, during the last Haj of the Holy Prophet, he asked the 
people, "What is this day?" The people answered, "It is the day of Sacrifice. "<br>
<br>The Holy Prophet said, "This is the day of Hajj-i-akbar" Here the word 
Hajj-i-akbar (Great Pilgrimage) has been used in contrast to Hajj-i-asghar which 
the Arabs used for 'Umrah' . Thus, the Haj which is performed in the prescribed 
dates of Zil-Haj is called Hajj-i-akbar. <br><br>5"......you also should observe 
the treaties with such people" who do not violate them, for your violation in 
such cases shall be against piety. And Muslims should remain pious under all 
circumstances "for Allah loves the pious people" only.<br><br>6Here "the months 
made unlawful" are not those four months during which war is forbidden for the 
sake of Haj and `Umrah but the four months that were made unlawful for the 
Muslims to make any attack on the mushriks, who were granted respite by v. 2.
<br><br>7That is, "Mere repentance from disbelief and shirk will not end the 
matter. but they shall have to perform the prescribed prayer and pay Zakat dues. 
Without these it will not be considered that they had given up disbelief and 
embraced Islam. " Hadrat Abu Bakr based his decision on this verse in the case 
of the apostates, after the death of the Holy Prophet, who argued that they were 
not the rejecters of Islam, because they offered Salat, even though they had 
refused to pay the Zakat dues. This argument roused doubts in the minds of the 
Companions in general that they had no right to fight with such people as these. 
But Hadrat Abu Bakr removed their doubts, saying, "Verse 5 enjoins us to let 
those people go their way who fulfill all the three conditions- repentance from 
shirk, the establishment of Salat and the payment of Zakat. We cannot forbear 
them, because they do not fulfill one of these three conditions."<br><br>8That 
is, "if during a fight, an enemy makes a request that he should be given an 
opportunity to understand Islam, the Muslims should give him a surety of 
protection and allow him to visit them. They should then present Islam before 
him in order to make him understand it. If, after this, he does not embrace 
Islam, they should convey him safely to his place" . Such a person who comes to 
Dar-ul-Islam under the above mentioned protection is called musta'min in the 
Islamic Code. <br><br>9That is: Bani Kinanah and Bani Khuza`ah and Bani Damrah.
<br><br>10That is, "Though outwardly they negotiated for peace treaties, they 
cherished evil intentions in their hearts, and waited for an opportune moment to 
break them. And this was borne by later experiences." <br><br>11They were 
evil-doers because they had no sense of moral responsibilities nor did they 
hesitate to break moral limits. <br><br>12That is, "When they had to make a 
choice between the Divine Guidance and the transitory worldly ambitions, they 
chose the latter, because they did not comprehend the comparative values of the 
two. Whereas the Revelations of Allah were inviting them to goodness, 
righteousness and observance of the Divine Law, which lead to eternal bliss, 
they chose to follow the unbridled lusts of their selves which gained some 
transitory worldly benefits for them, but consequently led them to eternal 
perdition. <br><br>13Those evil-doers "blocked His Way for others", for they not 
only chose misguidance for themselves but also tried to prevent others from 
following the right way. They put every kind of obstruction in the way of the 
invitation to righteousness; nay, they tried their worst to gag the mouths of 
those who were extending that invitation and make their lives hard for them. In 
short, they did all they could to prevent the establishment of the righteous 
system of life that Allah required the people to establish. <br><br>14Here, too, 
it has explicitly been stated that those who repent will not become your 
brethren in faith without the observance of Salat and Zakat.<br><br>"Yet if 
........they shall be your brethren in faith": This means that "if they fulfill 
those conditions, then not only shall their lives and properties become unlawful 
for you but also they shall enjoy equal rights with you in the Islamic 
Community. There shall be no distinction between them and the other Muslims in 
regard to social, cultural, legal and political rights, and nothing will stand 
in their way to the progress for which they are otherwise qualified.<br><br>
14a"........you should fight with them.....":perhaps the fear of war may force 
them to desist from breaking oaths and reviling Islam. <br><br>15In the 
context,the words, oaths and compacts mean the compact of the acceptance of 
Islam. Therefore, the question of making a new compact with them does not arise. 
As regards the old pacts, they had already broken all of them. It is on account 
of this that the declaration of immunity (from obligations) by Allah and His 
Messenger has been clearly made. It has also been stated that such people are 
not worthy of any treaty and they can only be let off if they repent of their 
disbelief and shirk and establish Salat and pay Zakat dues. This verse states 
clearly how the renegades should be treated. As a matter of fact, .this verse 
forestalled the mischief of apostasy that broke out a year and a half after its 
revelation and Hadrat Abu Bakr followed the guidance given in this verse to 
crush it. (For further explanation, see my book entitled Murtad ki Saza Islami 
Qanun men). <br><br>16In this passage the addressees are the Muslims. They have 
been urged to fight perseveringly in the Way of Allah, without paying the least 
heed to their ties of blood and relationship and to their worldly interests. In 
order to understand fully the spirit of this passage, the reader should keep in 
view the state of affairs at the time, when the abrogation of the treaties was 
declared. Though Islam was reigning supreme in the greater part of Arabia and 
there was no greater power to challenge its supremacy, still superficial 
observers saw a number of dangers in the extreme step which was being taken at 
that time.<br><br>First, it was feared that the abrogating of the treaties with 
all the mushrik clans at one and the same time, and debarring them from Haj and 
changing the guardianship of the Ka`abah and abolishing all the rituals of 
`ignorance', would so incite the mushriks and the hypocrites and kindle such 
fire of enmity that they would be ready to shed the last drop of their blood for 
safeguarding their interests and prejudices.<br><br>Secondly, it was feared that 
the mushriks would be greatly enraged by this declaration which granted freedom 
of movement to the Muslims to perform Haj, whereas it forbade the non-Muslims. 
Obviously this would also affect adversely their economic condition, for Haj 
played a very important part in the economic life of Arabia during that period 
of her history.<br><br>Lastly, it was feared that this would put to a hard trial 
those people who had embraced Islam recently after the Peace Treaty of 
Hudaibiyah and the Conquest of Makkah. For many of their kith and kin were still 
mushriks, some of whom had their interests closely bound up with those offices 
of `ignorance' which were abolished. Now it was obvious that the total war 
against the mushriks demanded that these new Muslims should not only kill their 
own near and dear ones but should also themselves abolish those ancient offices 
and distinctions which they had enjoyed for centuries.<br><br>Though it is true 
that none of these dangers took any practical shape, there were good reasons for 
these apprehensions, for none could foresee the trends of events at the time of 
the abrogation of the treaties. And the dangers were averted because these 
Commandments had prepared them beforehand to meet them. More than that: this 
preparedness produced other good results. The delegates from the remnants of the 
mushriks, their chiefs and rulers began to visit Al-Madinah and take the oath of 
allegiance to Islam and obedience to the Holy prophet, who let them retain their 
old positions and offices. These things proved that if the Muslims had not been 
in a state of readiness to take immediate action for enforcing the terms of the 
"Declaration" with the sword, the events which followed might have taken a 
different direction. Therefore it was the need of the hour that the Muslims 
should have been vehemently urged for Jihad, and their apprehensions removed. 
That is why it was being enjoined that they should not let anything hinder them 
from doing the Will of Allah. And this is the theme of this discourse. <br><br>
17This was a subtle reference to the possibility of what actually was going to 
happen afterwards. "And He may remove ......... repentance": this was to remove 
the misunderstandings of the Muslims who apprehended a bloody war as a result of 
the Declaration. They were told that it was also possible that some of the 
enemies might repent and embrace Islam. This was not made quite plain lest it 
should slacken the war preparations of the Muslims on one side and weaken the 
force of the warning to the mushriks on the other. The latter thing might have 
hindered the mushriks from giving a serious thought to the critical position 
they were in that finally led them to embrace Islam. <br><br>18The addressees in 
v. 16 were those Muslims who had recently embraced Islam. It means to tell them 
plainly: "Now that you have embraced Islam, you shall ave to give a genuine 
proof by a trial that you have accepted it because you believe in its Truth and 
not because it has become supreme in the country by the exertions of the true 
Believers. The trial is that you shall have to sacrifice your lives, wealths and 
your near and dear ones for the sake of Allah and His Way. Then and only then, 
you will be regarded as true Believers."<br><br>19This lays down the general 
principle for the guardianship of the places of worship that ave been built 
exclusively for the worship of Allah. Obviously, those people who associate 
others with Allah in His essence, His rights and His powers cannot be the proper 
persons to be the guardians, the servants, the managers etc. of such sacred 
places. And when they themselves reject the invitations to Tauhid, and openly 
declare that they are not going to dedicate their worship and obedience 
exclusively o Allah, they automatically forfeit any right they ad for the 
guardianship of such places of worship that had been built for the worship of 
Allah alone. Though the principle is of a general nature, it has been mentioned 
here with the particular object of removing the mushriks from the guardianship 
of the Ka`abah and Masjid-i-Haram and establishing permanently the guardianship 
of the worshipers of One God over them. <br><br>20".........all their works have 
gone to waste.....", including the little real service they did to the `House of 
Allah' because they mixed with it shirk and other practices of ignorance. Their 
little good was destroyed by their far greater evils. <br><br>21This question 
has been posed to bring home the fact that the guardianship of a shrine or 
attendance at it or other religious acts that are done for show, and are 
exploited by worldly people to establish and maintain the show of their piety, 
have no value whatsoever in the sight of Allah. The real worth of a person with 
Allah is that he should be sincere in his beliefs and make sacrifices in the Way 
of Allah, no matter whether he enjoys or does not enjoy such distinctions or 
happens to descend or not from a family of `saints'. On the contrary, those 
people who lack these excellences have no value with Allah, no matter whether 
they be the descendants of saints or inherit the guardianship of shrines from a 
long line of saints, or perform some `religious' acts for show on special 
occasions. And it is not lawful in any way that the guardianship, etc. of sacred 
places and institutions should be left in the hands of these worthless people 
just because they happen to inhere such rights from their forefathers.<br><br>
22That is: "The judgment will deprive them of the blessings of the true Faith, 
and of the honor of bearing its standard and leading the world towards its 
guidance. and bestow these on others". <br><br>23This has been mentioned to 
allay the fears of those who were afraid of the consequences of the Declaration 
of the abrogation of the treaties, as if to say, "Why are you afraid of war? 
That Allah, Who helped you in far worse and dangerous situations on so many 
occasions before this, is there even now to help you. Had this Mission depended 
on your might, it could not have come out victorious in the hard trials at 
Makkah nor in the Battle of Badr when the odds were heavily against you. This is 
because Allah's Power has been helping you, and past experiences have shown you 
how effective that Power is. Rest assured that the same Power will help you to 
succeed in your Mission."<br><br>The Battle of Hunain had taken place in the 
valley of Hunain between Ta'if and Makkah in the month of Shawwal A.H. 8, a year 
or so before the Revelation of this discourse. This was the first battle in 
which the Muslim army consisted of 12,000 fighters and this far outnumbered the 
army of the disbelievers. But in spite of this the archers of the Hawazin clan 
wrought havoc among the Muslim army and put them to rout. The Holy Prophet and a 
few of his bravest Companions, however, firmly stood their ground and rallied 
the routed army, and ultimately won the victory. It was because of their 
perseverance that the army reassembled and the Muslims ultimately won the 
victory; otherwise they would have lost much more at Hunain than they had gained 
by the conquest of Makkah. <br><br>24".....Allah enables .....to repent" refers 
to the large number of the disbelievers who embraced Islam after the victory at 
Hunain as a result of the kind and generous treatment they received from the 
Holy Prophet, in spite of their former antagonism. This was mentioned to allay 
the anxiety of those new Muslims who feared that, as a result of the 
Declaration, all of their mushrik relatives would be put to death. (E.N. 16). 
They have been told to expect, in the light of the previous experiences, that 
the mushriks would be obliged to accept Islam, when they realize that neither 
any hope of the revival of the order of 'ignorance' was Ieft nor of any props to 
support it. <br><br>25This prohibition was meant to root out all the vestiges of 
shirk and ' ignorance' . For the mushriks were prohibited not only from the 
performance of Haj and attendance at the Masjid-i-Haram but also from entering 
into its sacred precincts .<br><br>They are "unclean" in their creeds, in their 
morals, in their deeds, and in their ways of `ignorance', and not in their 
physical bodies by themselves. That is the reason why they have been prohibited 
from entering the sacred precincts of the Holy Place.<br><br>This prohibition 
has been interpreted in different ways. Imam Abu Hanifah is of the view that it 
prohibits them only from the performance of Haj and Umrah, and from the 
observance of the rites of `ignorance' in the Holy Precincts. But Imam Shafi`i 
is of the opinion that they have been forbidden even to enter the Masjid-i-Haram 
for any purpose whatsoever. Imam Malik is of the opinion that they are forbidden 
not only to enter Masjid-i-Haram but any mosque at all. It is, however, obvious 
that the last opinion is not correct, as the Holy Prophet himself permitted 
mushriks to enter the Prophet's Mosque at Al-Madinah. <br><br>26Though the 
people of the Book professed to believe in Allah and the Hereafter, in fact they 
believed in neither. For only that person really believes in Allah who 
acknowledges Him as the only One God and the only One Lord, and does not 
associate with Him any other, whatsoever, in His Being, in His characteristics, 
in His rights and in His powers and authority. But according to this definition 
of shirk both the Christians and the Jews were guilty of shirk as has been made 
plain in the verses that follow: therefore their profession of belief in Allah 
was meaningless. Likewise they did not really believe in the Hereafter, in spite 
of the fact that they believed in Resurrection. For it is not enough: one must 
also believe that on that Day absolute justice will be done on the basis of 
one's belief and actions. One should also believe that no ransom and no 
expiation and no 'spiritual' relationships with any 'saint' shall be of any 
avail on that Day. It is absolutely meaningless to believe in the Hereafter 
without this. And the Jews and the Christians had polluted their faiths because 
they believed that such things would protect them against justice on that Day.<br>
<br>27The second reason why Jihad should be waged against them is drat they did 
not adopt the Law sent down by Allah through His Messenger. <br><br>28This is 
the aim of Jihad with the Jews and the Christians and it is not to force them to 
become Muslims and adopt the `Islamic Way of Life.' They should be forced to pay 
Jizyah in order to put an end to their independence and supremacy so that they 
should not remain rulers and sovereigns in the land. These powers should be 
wrested from them by the followers of the true Faith, who should assume the 
sovereignty and lead others towards the Right Way, while they should become 
their subjects and pay jizyah. jizyah is paid by those non-Muslims who live as 
Zimmis (proteges) in an Islamic State, in exchange for the security and 
protection granted to them by it. This is also symbolical of the fact that they 
themselves agree to live in it as its subjects. This is the significance of 
"..... they Pay jizyah with their own hands," that is, "with full consent so 
that they willingly become the subjects of the Believers, who perform the duty 
of the vicegerents of Allah on the earth. "<br><br>At first this Command applied 
only to the Jews and the Christians. Then the Holy Prophet himself extended it 
to the Zoroastrians also. After his death, his Companions unanimously applied 
this rule to all the non-Muslim nations outside Arabia.<br><br>This is jizyah " 
of which the Muslims have been feeling apologetic during the last two centuries 
of their degeneration and there are still some people who continue to apologize 
for it. But the Way of Allah is straight and clear and does not stand in need of 
any apology to the rebels against Allah. Instead of offering apologies on behalf 
of Islam for the measure that guarantees security of life, property and faith to 
those who choose to live under its protection, the Muslims should feel proud of 
such a humane law as that of jizyah. For it is obvious that the maximum freedom 
that can be allowed to those who do not adopt the Way of Allah but choose to 
tread the ways of error is that they should be tolerated to lead the life they 
like. That is why the Islamic State offers them protection, if they agree to 
live as its Zimmis by paying jizyah, but it cannot allow that they should remain 
supreme rulers in any place and establish wrong ways and impose them on others. 
As this state of things inevitably produces chaos and disorder, it is the duty 
of the true Muslims to exert their utmost to bring to an end their wicked rule 
and bring them under a righteous order.<br><br>As regards the question, "What do 
the non-Muslims get in return for Jizyah " it may suffice to say that it is the 
price of the freedom which the Islamic State allows them in following their 
erroneous ways, while living in the jurisdiction of Islam and enjoying its 
protection. The money thus collected is spent in maintaining the righteous 
administration that gives them the freedom and protects their rights. This also 
serves as a yearly reminder to them that they have been deprived of the honor of 
paying Zakat in the Way of Allah, and forced to pay jizyah instead as a price of 
following the ways of error. <br><br>29Uzair (Ezra) lived during the period 
around 450 B.C. The Jews regarded him with great reverence as the revivalist of 
their Scriptures which had beat lost during their captivity in Babylon after the 
death of Prophet Solomon. So much so that they had lost all the knowledge of 
their Law, their traditions and of Hebrew, their national language. Then it was 
Ezra who re-wrote the Old Testament and revived the Law. That is why they used 
very exaggerated language in his reverence which misled some of the Jewish sects 
to make him 'the son of God'. The Qur'an, however, does not assert that all the 
Jews were unanimous in declaring Ezra as 'the son of God'. What it intends to 
say is that the perversion in the articles of faith of the Jews concerning Allah 
had degenerated to such an extent that there were some amongst them who 
considered Ezra as the son of God. <br><br>30"Those who were involved in Kufr 
before them" were the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Persians, etc. The 
Jews and the Christians were so influenced by their philosophies, their 
superstitions and fancies that they also invented erroneous creeds like theirs. 
(For details sec E.N. 101 of Al-Maidah). <br><br>31"They have taken their 
scholars and monks as their Lords the Holy Prophet himself explained its true 
significance. According to a Tradition, when Hadrat `Adi bin Hatim, who was 
formerly a Christian, came to the Holy Prophet with the intention of 
understanding Islam, he asked several questions in order to remove his doubts. 
One of these was: "This verse accuses us of taking our scholars and monks as our 
lords. What is its real meaning, sir? For we do not take them as our fords."<br>
<br>As a reply to this, the Holy Prophet put him a counter-question: "Is it not 
a fact that you accept as unlawful what they declare to be unlawful, and lawful 
what they declare to be lawful?" 'Adi confessed, "Yes, sir, it is so." The Holy 
Prophet replied, "This amounts to making them your lords." Incidentally, this 
Tradition shows that those who themselves set limits to the lawful and the 
unlawful without the authority of Allah's Book, assume for themselves the rank 
of Godhead, and those who acknowledge their right of making laws take them as 
their Lords.<br><br>It should be noted that they have been charged with (a) 
attributing sons to Allah, and (b) giving the right of making laws to others 
than Allah. These are to prove that their claim, that they believed in Allah, is 
false, even though they should believe in his existence. But such a wrong 
conception of Allah makes their belief in Allah meaningless. <br><br>32The 
Arabic word ad-din has been translated into 'ways'. For the word din, as has 
already been explained in E.N. 204, :Al-Baqarah, is used for the 'way of life' 
or the 'system of life', which is followed in obedience to the supreme 
authority.<br><br>Now let us try to understand the significance of this verse. 
The object of the Mission of the Messenger is to make the Guidance and the Right 
Way he has brought from Allah dominant over all the other ways and systems of 
life. In other words, the Messenger is not sent to allow Allah's Way to remain 
subordinate to other ways in order to enjoy concessions from them. He is sent by 
the Sovereign of the earth and the heavens to make His Way dominant over all 
other ways. And if a wrong way is at all allowed to remain on the earth, it 
should be tolerated only under its own protection by the payment of Jizyah under 
the limits conferred by the Divine System as in the cast of the system of life 
of the Zimmis who pay Jizyah. <br><br>33These religious leaders are guilty of 
two sins. First, they devour the wealth of the common people by selling false 
decrees, and by taking bribes, gifts and presents on different pretexts. They 
invent religious regulations and rituals as tempt people to buy their salvations 
and fortunes in life from them and make deaths and marriages dependent on the 
payment of due `price' to these "monopolists" of Paradise. To add to this 
another sin, they debar the people from the Way of Allah by involving them into 
different sorts of deviations and by obstructing the way of every Righteous 
Mission with the obstacles of `learned' doubts and `pious' suspicions.<br><br>
34This means that ever since Allah created the sun, the moon and the earth, the 
new moon takes place only once in a month; thus the year has always been of 
twelve months.<br><br>This has been mentioned to refute the practice of nasi (v. 
37) whereby the pagan Arabs increased the number of the months of a year to 13 
or 14 to enable them to interpose in the calendar the forbidden month which had 
been made lawful by them. (For fuller explanation see E.N. 37). <br><br>
35"....do not wrong yourselves ....": "Do not let go waste the good things for 
which fighting has been made unlawful during these months by creating disorder 
in them that will ultimately be harmful to you also" . The four forbidden months 
are . . Zil-Q`adah, Zil-Hajjah and Muharram for Haj and Rajab for ' Umrah.<br>
<br>36That is, ''If the mushriks do not desist from fighting during these 
months, you should also fight them and present a united front against them, just 
as they put up a united front against you". This verse has been explained by v. 
194 of Al-Baqarah. <br><br>37The pagan Arabs practiced nasi in two ways. 
Whenever it suited them, they would declare a prohibited month to be an ordinary 
month in which fighting, robbery and murder in retaliation were lawful for them. 
Then they would declare an ordinary month to be a prohibited month instead of 
this month in order to make up for the deficiency caused in the number of the 
prohibited months.<br><br>The other way of nasi was the addition of a month in 
order to harmonize the lunar with the solar year so that the Haj should always 
fall in the same season and they should be saved from the bother and 
inconvenience that are experienced by its observance according to the lunar 
year. In this way Haj was observed for 36 years on dates other than the actual 
dates. Then in the thirty seventh year it was again observed on the 9th and 10th 
of Zil-Hajjah, as they should have actually fallen according to the lunar 
calendar. It so happened that on the occasion when the Holy Prophet performed 
Hajja-tul-Wida'a (his Last Haj). these dates by rotation coincided with the 
actual dates of Haj according to the lunar calendar. So he declared during the 
course of his historic address at `Arafat: "This year the dates of Haj have 
again occurred exactly at their natural and proper time after a long period of 
circulation. " Accordingly, since that `Last Haj' of A.H. 9, it is being 
observed up to this day according to the correct dates of the lunar year.<br>
<br>By making nasi unlawful and forbidding it, the Law declared that the two 
objects for which it was practiced were also sinful. First, they not only made 
lawful what Allah had made unlawful but also tried to practice deception on 
Allah by the seeming observance of the Law. As regards the second object of 
making the season of Haj fixed permanently according to the solar calendar, this 
too, was in fact the worst kind of rebellion against the Divine Law, although it 
appeared to be a harmless thing done for public good. But it defeated the very 
object of the Divine Law which prescribed the lunar calendar instead of the 
solar calendar for the observance of obligatory duties. Allah did this to ensure 
many good things for the Muslims, one of which is that His servants should be so 
trained as to obey His Commandments at all times of the year and under all 
circumstances. For instance, the month of Ramadan circulates among all the 
seasons of the year and the Muslims get used to obeying His Commandments whether 
it be summer or winter, dry or rainy season. This gives them that excellent 
moral training which is the real object of all the obligatory duties imposed by 
the Divine Law. Likewise, the dates of Haj according to the lunar calendar, fall 
during different seasons: therefore the servants of Allah have to travel during 
all the seasons, favorable and unfavorable. Thus they come out successful in the 
Divine test under all the circumstances and learn to be steadfast in their 
obedience.<br><br>It is obvious that such a training will stand them in good 
stead in many other fields in which one has to fight the battle of the Truth.<br>
<br>Now it would have become quite clear why nasi was made unlawful and 
forbidden. It was designed to fix the season of Haj in order to suit their own 
conveniences though it defeated the Divine purpose of Haj and of the forbidden 
months. It meant that they had rebelled against Allah and become independent of 
Him; this is kufr. Besides this, Islam is a universal religion and for all human 
beings. It is obvious that the periods of fasting and performing Haj cannot 
satisfy all if they be fixed in accordance with the months of the solar year. 
For if they are performed in fixed months according to the solar year, the one 
and the same month will not equally suit all for the simple reason that it will 
fall during the same seasons in different places-summer or winter or very hot or 
very cold or rainy or dry or harvesting or sowing-year after year.<br><br>In 
this connection it may also be kept in view that the proclamation about the 
prohibition of "nasi " was made on the occasion of Haj in A. H . 9 and next 
year,the Haj was performed on right dates which were in accordance with the 
lunar year. Since that time Haj is being performed according to exact dates.<br>
<br>38From here begins the discourse (vv. 38-72) which was sent down at the time 
when the Holy Prophet was engaged in making preparations for the Campaign to 
Tabuk. <br><br>39".... you should know that the goods ... Hereafter" may imply 
two meanings. First: "When you will find that the life in the Hereafter is 
eternal and see that the good things and the provisions of enjoyment are 
countless, you will realize that the potential and the actual enjoyments of the 
temporary life of this world were nothing as compared with the blessings of that 
great Kingdom. At that time you will regret why you deprived yourselves of this 
everlasting happiness and bliss for the sake of the little-very 
little-sort-lived enjoyments of the mortal life of this world. " Second: "The 
goods of this worldly life are of no value in the Hereafter, howsoever abundant 
they might be. You shall have to give up each and everything as soon as you 
breathe your last, for nothing of this world can go with you to the Next World. 
Of course, you will get credit for what you sacrificed for the pleasure and love 
of Allah, and love of Islam." <br><br>40A general rule of the Islamic conduct 
has been derived from "If you .... chastisement. " When the Muslims are 
commanded to go to Jihad by a public proclamation from their leader, it becomes 
an obligatory duty for those who are called upon to do Jihad, whether they 
belong to any particular group or region. So much so that the Faith of those who 
do not go for Jihad without a genuine excuse becomes doubtful. But even in cases 
where the Muslims are called upon to go forth for Jihad and there is no command 
for the compulsory enrollment of every able-bodied Muslim of a particular group 
or region, it is a religious duty (though not obligatory), and it shall be 
considered to have been performed even if only some Muslims go forth for it. <br>
<br>41That is, "Allah's work does not depend on you and will be accomplished 
only if you do it. It is Allah's grace and bounty that He is affording you the 
golden opportunity of serving the cause of His Way. Therefore if you miss this 
opportunity because of any foolish assumption, Allah will raise another people 
and bestow on them the opportunity and capability of doing His work, and you 
will be losers". <br><br>42This refers to the occasion when the disbelievers had 
decided to assassinate the Holy Prophet, and the very night fixed for his 
assassination he had left Makkah for Al-Madinah. By that time most of the 
Muslims had migrated to Al-Madinah in twos and threes and only a few helpless 
ones had remained behind in Makkah. As he was sure that he would be pursued, he 
took only Hadrat Abu Bakr with him and went southward instead of following the 
northern route to Al-Madinah and remained hidden in the Thaur Cave for three 
days. In the meantime the blood thirsty enemies had begun to make a thorough 
search for him all around Makkah and some of them reached the very mouth of the 
Cave where he was hidden. On this critical occasion Hadrat Abu Bakr naturally 
felt alarmed lest they should peep into the Cave, and see them. But the Holy 
Prophet remained as calm as before and reassured his Companion, saying, "Be not 
distressed: indeed Allah is with us." <br><br>43The words ".... whether you are 
light or heavy ..." have a very comprehensive meaning: "When it is enjoined to 
march forth for Jihad, you must go forth anyhow, whether you like it or not: 
whether you are in a state of prosperity or indigence: whether you are 
well-equipped or ill-equipped: whether the circumstances are favorable or 
adverse: whether you are young and healthy or old and weak. " <br><br>44They 
felt the journey to Tabuk to be hard because they had to fight with the army of 
the great and powerful Roman Empire: because they had to journey in the 
scorching heat of the summer season of the desert: because there was a famine in 
the country and the new harvest on which they had pinned their hopes, was ready 
for reaping.<br><br>45Allah did not approve of the exemption which the Holy 
Prophet had granted to the hypocrites who had put forward lame excuses. Though 
he knew it well that they were inventing false excuses, he gave them leave to 
stay behind because of his inherent kindness. But Allah warned him that such a 
leniency was not well placed as he gave them an opportunity of hiding their 
hypocrisy. Had they remained behind without getting an exemption, the false 
profession of their faith would have been exposed. <br><br>46This verse shows 
clearly that the conflict between Islam and kufr is the criterion to distinguish 
between a true Believer and a hypocrite. The one who supports Islam in this 
conflict with the whole of his heart and expends all of his energies and 
resources in order to make it victorious and does not hesitate in the least to 
make any sacrifices for this purpose, is a true Believer. On the contrary, the 
one who hesitates to support Islam in this conflict and refrains from making 
sacrifices in its Way, when he confronts the threat of the victory of kufr, is a 
hypocrite, for such an attitude is itself a proof of the fact that there is no 
faith in his heart.<br><br>47Allah held them back for He did not like that they 
should join Jihad unwillingly without any sincere intention for it. As they had 
no mind to make sacrifices to exalt the cause of Islam, and, therefore, would 
have taken part in it. half-heartedly to escape the taunts of the Muslims or to 
create mischief, this would have resulted in a greater evil, as has been stated 
explicitly in the next verse (48). <br><br>48Some of the hypocrites, who were 
requesting the Holy Prophet to give them leave to stay behind on one pretext or 
the other, were so impudent that they were inventing excuses of a religious or 
moral nature for refraining from jihad in the Way of Allah. One of these was Jad-bin-Qais, 
who, according to traditions came to the Holy Prophet and said. "I am a lover of 
beauty and my people know that I am very weak in regard to women: therefore I am 
afraid to go forth lest the beauty of the Roman women should beguile me into 
sin. Therefore ".... do not expose me to temptations." <br><br>49Though they 
wanted exemption, they had already fallen a prey to the temptations of telling 
lies, of double dealings and hypocrisy. They deluded themselves that they would 
be considered pious people, if they would put forward the fear of temptations to 
avoid Jihad, when, in fact; they had already fallen into the greatest possible 
temptation of refraining from Jihad in the conflict between Islam and kufr.<br>
<br>50That is, "Such a show of piety has not taken them away from Hell; nay, on 
the other hand, the same thing has caused them to be entangled in the clutches 
of Hell."<br><br>51In this passage a demarcation has been made between the 
attitudes of a man of the world and of a man of God. Whatever the man of the 
world does, he does it to please his own self. He exults if he attains some 
worldly ends but feels utterly dejected if he fails to attain them. Besides, he 
depends entirely on his material resources for his success and feels encouraged 
if these are favorable, but loses heart if these are unfavorable.<br><br>In 
contrast to the man of the world, whatever the man of God does, he does it to 
please Him and trusts in Him and not in his own powers nor in material 
resources. Therefore he is neither exultant over his success in the cause of 
Allah nor loses heart by failure, for he believes that it is the Will of God 
that is working in both the cases. Therefore he is neither disheartened by 
disasters nor is filled with conceit by successes. This is because he believes 
that both prosperity and adversity are from Allah and are nothing but a trial 
from Him. Therefore his only worry is to do his best to come out successful in 
His test. Besides, as there are no worldly ends before him, he does not measure 
his success or failure by the achievement or failure of his ends. On the other 
hand, the only object before him is to sacrifice his life and wealth in the Way 
of Allah, and he measures the success or failure of his efforts by the standard 
he achieves in the performance of this duty. Therefore if he is satisfied that 
he has done his best to perform this duty, he believes that he has come out 
successful by the grace of God, though he might not have been able to accomplish 
anything from the worldly point of view; for he believes that his Allah in Whose 
cause he has expended his life and wealth will not let go waste the reward of 
his efforts. As he does not depend on the material resources only, he is neither 
grieved if they are unfavorable, nor feels exultant when these are favorable. 
His entire trust is in God Who is the controller of all the resources; therefore 
he goes on doing his duty even under the most unfavorable circumstances with the 
same courage and perseverance that is shown by the worldly people unfavorable 
circumstances alone. That is why Allah asked the Holy Prophet to say to the 
hypocrites, "There is a basic difference between you and us in regard to the 
conduct of affairs. We believe that both the good and the bad are from Allah: 
therefore the apparent result does not make us happy or sad. Moreover, we depend 
on Allah in our affairs and you depend on material resources: so we are content 
and happy in all circumstances." <br><br>52This is the answer to those who, as 
usual, were not taking any part in the conflict between Islam and kufr, but were 
very "wisely" watching it from a distance to see whether the Holy Prophet and 
his Companions would return victorious from Tabuk or would be totally destroyed 
by the powerful Roman army. They were told that either of the two results they 
were awaiting, would be good for the Muslims. For it was obvious that it would 
be a good thing if they won victory. But even if they were killed in the Way of 
Allah, it would be a success froth their point of view, though not in the sight 
of the world, as the Muslims' standard of measurement is different from that of 
the hypocrites and the like. A Believer considers it his success if he 
sacrifices his life and wealth in the Way of Allah, irrespective of whether he 
succeeds in conquering some country or in establishing a government or not. 
According to him the criterion of success or failure is whether he has extended 
or not all the powers of his body and soul, his head and his heart to elevate 
the Word of Allah, though from the worldly point of view the result of his 
efforts might be nothing at all."<br><br>53V. 53 is a sharp retort to those 
hypocrites who desired exemption froth Jihad but, at the same time, wanted to 
make some monetary contributions in order to avoid the exposure of their 
hypocrisy, They said, "Please grant us leave from military service because we 
are unable to do this, but we are ready to make monetary contributions towards 
it." To this Allah retorted, saying, "Whatever you may contribute, it shall not 
be accepted".<br><br>54"Allah wills to chastise them by means of these things in 
this world", because of their great love for their children and wealth as these 
misled them to adopt the hypocritical attitude which, in turn, degraded them in 
the Muslim society. Consequently, in the Islamic System they would lose the 
respect, tire reputation and the prestige they enjoyed in the pre-lslamic 
society. On the contrary, even the Muslim slaves and the sons of slaves, the 
farmers and the shepherds, who proved the sincerity of their Faith would win 
honor in the new system, and the big hereditary chiefs, who refrained from this 
because of their love of the world, would lose their fame, honor and prestige.<br>
<br>In order to illustrate the above we cite an incident that happened during 
the Caliphate of Hadrat `Umar. Once some big chiefs of the Quraish including 
Suhail-bin-`Amr and Harith-bin-Hisham, went to see Caliph Umar and took their 
seats near him. Soon after this some humble people from among the Muhajirin and 
the Ansar came there. The Caliph asked those chiefs to make room for them, and 
seated these humble people near his own seat. This went on for some time till 
these chiefs reached the remotest corner in the assembly. When they came out, 
Harith-bin-Hisham said to his companions, "You have noticed what a humiliating 
treatment has been meted out to us today!" Suhail-bin-`Amr replied, "It is no 
fault of `Umar but it is our own fault. When we were invited to Islam, we turned 
away from it, but these humble people accepted it and made sacrifices for it. " 
Then both of them returned to the meeting and said "Today we have noticed your 
treatment and we feel that it is all due to our own shortcomings, but tell us if 
there is a way for us to make atonements for our past failures" . The Caliph did 
not make any reply but merely pointed towards the Roman territory, which meant 
that the only way of regaining their prestige was to expend their lives and 
wealths in doing Jihad there. <br><br>55"They would die in a state of unbelief" 
because of their hypocrisy, which would not let them attain sincere Faith till 
they die. Thus after ruining their moral and spiritual lives in this world, they 
would leave it in the state of unbelief, which will ruin their lives in the 
Hereafter in a far worse way. <br><br>56This was the condition of the hypocrites 
of Al-Madinah, the majority of whore were rich and old. We find from a list of 
the hypocrites, cited by Ibn Kathir in Al-Badayah-wan-Nihayah, that only one of 
them was young and none was poor. These people had large properties and 
flourishing businesses in Al Madinah. They were worldly-wise and their wide 
experience had taught them expediency, but their sense of self-interest had put 
them into a dilemma. When Islam reached Al-Madinah and a large majority of the 
population embraced it sincerely and enthusiastically, they found themselves in 
a very perplexing situation. They could not reject it outright for the majority 
of their own people, nay, their own sons and daughters, were filled with 
enthusiasm for Islam. If they had remained unbelievers, they would have lost 
their high position, their prestige and reputation and run the risk of a 
rebellion by the Muslims of their own household. On the other hand, if they 
sincerely embraced Islam, they would incur the danger of war, not only with the 
whole of Arabia but also with the adjoining nations and empires. Above all, 
self-interest had so blinded them that, in resolving the dilemma, they would not 
consider the problem from the point of view of truth and righteousness which by 
themselves are worthy of every sacrifice. Therefore they decided that the best 
thing for them was to profess Islam outwardly in order to make their positions, 
properties and businesses secure, but to adopt a hypocritical attitude towards 
it so that they might be able to avoid the losses and perils inherent in the 
sincere acceptance of Islam.<br><br>This verse (57) depicts the dilemma of the 
hypocrites, as if to say, "In reality these people are not Muslims, though they 
swear that they are Muslims like you; they profess Islam simply because they are 
afraid of losses they might incur, if they reject it outright. Then they dare 
not stay at AI-Madinah as non-Muslims for they would lose the high positions 
they enjoyed and might even have to cut off their connection with their wives 
and children; and if they decided to emigrate from AI-Madinah, they would have 
to abandon their properties and business. But they are not prepared for these 
sacrifices for they have no sincere attachment even to kufr. Therefore they are 
compelled against their beliefs by the force of circumstances to remain in AI-Madinah: 
they offer their Salat but regard this as forced labor: they pay the Zakat dues 
but as a penalty, for they are in their heart of hearts averse to these things. 
To add to their `calamities' they are asked every now and then to make 
sacrifices of their lives and their wealth and to go forth for Jihad and to 
fight with one enemy or the other. They are so much afraid of these `calamities' 
that, in order to escape from them, they would run in frantic haste to take 
refuge in any hole, if they hoped that it would provide immunity against these 
'calamities' .<br><br>57The people referred to were the hypocrites, who felt 
depressed on every occasion of the distribution of the Zakat collections, for 
they thought that they were not being given their due share. Then they would 
taunt the Holy Prophet with making unfair distributions. This happened when the 
payment of Zakat was made an obligatory duty on all those Muslims whose 
possessions exceeded the prescribed limits. They were required to contribute 
from their agricultural products, animals, commercial commodities, minerals dug 
out of mines and the gold and silver they possessed, at different rates, varying 
from 2½% to 20%,and all these were collected and spent in a systematic way from 
a central place.<br><br>As a result of this so much wealth flowed into the hands 
of a single person, the Holy Prophet, that it had no parallel in the whole 
territory of Arabia. Naturally the materialists looked at these things with 
greedy eyes and wanted to grab as much as possible out of this wealth. But their 
greed could not be satisfied, for the Holy Prophet, who had made the use of 
Zakat Fund unlawful for his own person and for his own relatives, could not be 
expected to give anything out of it to anyone who did not deserve it. It is thus 
obvious that they found fault with the Holy Prophet not because he was unfair in 
the distribution of the Zakat collections but because he did not allow the 
hypocrites to grab anything from these without any right to them. They, however, 
very cunningly hid their real grievance, and accused the Holy Prophet of showing 
partiality and injustice in the distribution of the Zakat collection <br><br>
58That is, it would have been much better for them if they had been content with 
their share of the spoils which the Holy Prophet gave them and what they earned 
by the grace of Allah and with the prosperity Allah had bestowed on them.<br>
<br>59It would have been good for. them to adopt this attitude: "Allah suffices 
us....bounty," for they ought to have known that they would receive their due 
shares besides the Zakat collections out of the wealth that would come to the 
State treasury, just as they were receiving their shares previously.<br><br>
60"We look to Allah alone" means "We give ow attention to Allah and His grace 
and not to the world and its worthless riches and we desire to do His Will: we 
direct ow expectations and hopes to Him and we are content with what He bestows 
on us."<br><br>61According to the Arabic usage (fuqara: the needy) are all those 
people who depend on others for the necessities of life. The Arabic word fuqara'. 
is a general word for all those who are needy because of some physical defects, 
or old age, or temporarily, and can become self-supporting if they are helped. 
e.g. orphans, widows, the unemployed, etc. , etc.<br><br>62According to the 
Arabic usage( masakin) are those indigent people who are in greater distress 
than the needy people usually are. The Holy Prophet especially enjoined the 
Muslims to help such people as are unable to find the necessary means to satisfy 
their wants and are in very straitened circumstances, but are so self-respecting 
that they would not beg for anything nor would others judge from their outward 
appearance that they were deserving people. According to a Tradition "Miskin is 
one who cannot make both ends meet, though his appearance does not show that he 
needs help nor does he beg for help." In short, he is a self-respecting man who 
has become needy.<br><br>63"....who are employed to collect them...." are those 
who collect Zakat dues, supervise the collections and keep accounts, and help in 
their distribution, irrespective of the fact whether or not they are needy or 
indigent; their remunerations shall be paid out of the Zakat Funds. In this 
connection it should be noted well that the Holy Prophet had declared the Zakat 
Funds to be unlawful for himself and for the members of his own family (Bani 
Hashim). Accordingly, he never received any remuneration for collecting or 
distributing Zakat Funds. As regards the other members of Bani Hashim, they were 
allowed to do this service without receiving any remuneration, but otherwise it 
is unlawful for them. On the contrary, the payment of the Zakat dues was 
obligatory on Bani Hashim if their possessions warranted this under the 
prescribed limits, but under no circumstances whatsoever were they allowed to 
accept anything out of zakat collected from others.<br><br>There is, however, a 
difference of opinion as to whether they should accept anything out of the 
collections made from their own family or not. Imam Abu Yusuf opines that they 
are allowed to accept these when they are needy or poor or wayfarers, but the 
majority of the Jurists regard this also unlawful. <br><br>64A portion of Zakat 
Funds may also be given to win over to Islam those who might be engaged in anti-lslamic 
activities or to those in the camp of the unbelievers who might be brought to 
help the Muslims or to those newly converted Muslims, who might be inclined to 
revert to kufr if no monetary help was extended to them. It is permissible to 
award pensions to them or give them lump sums of money to make them helpers of 
Islam or submissive to it or at least to render them into harmless enemies. A 
portion of the spoils or other incomes may be spent on them and, if need be, 
also a portion of Zakat Funds. In such cases, the condition of being needy or 
indigent or on a journey etc., is also waived; nay, they might be even rich 
people or chiefs who are otherwise not eligible for anything from Zakat Funds.<br>
<br>All are agreed that during the time of the Holy Prophet pensions and gifts 
were given under the head of 'winning over people', but there is a difference of 
opinion whether this head of expenditure was abolished or not after his death. 
Imam Abu Hanifah and his followers are of the opinion that it was abolished 
during the Caliphate of Hadrat `Umar, and `now it is not lawful to spend 
anything under this head'. Imam Shafi`i is of the opinion that something tray be 
given to j sinful Muslims under this head from Zakat Funds but not to 
unbelievers, while other Jurists arc of the opinion that expenses under this 
head are lawful even now, if a need arises for them.<br><br>The Hanafis base 
their opinion on an incident that happened after the death of the Holy Prophet. 
`Uyainah bin Hisan and Aqra`a bin Habis came to Hadrat Abu Bakr and asked him to 
allot to them a certain piece of land. So he gave them a written order for this. 
They took it to some other highly placed Companions for further confirmation and 
some of them endorsed this order. But when they took it to Hadrat `Umar, he tore 
the paper into pieces before their very eyes, saying, "It is true that the Holy 
Prophet used to give something to win over your hearts because Islam was weak at 
that time, but now Allah has made Islam so strong that it does not stand in need 
of people like you. " At this they went to Hadrat Abu Bakr and complained to him 
about it and taunted him, saying, "Are you the Caliph or `Umar?" But he took no 
notice of this nor did any of the Companions differ with Hadrat `Umar's opinion. 
The Hanafis conclude from this incident that when the number and power of 
Muslims increased by the grace of Allah and they no longer stood in need of any 
support from such people; the reason for which expenses under this head were 
permitted in the first instance remained no longer there. Therefore the 
Companions unanimously abolished expenditure under this head.<br><br>Imam 
Shafi'i says that there is nothing to prove that the Holy Prophet ever spent 
anything out of Zakat Funds under this head. All the incidents mentioned in the 
traditions show that whatever he spent for the purpose of winning over hearts to 
Islam, was spent out of the spoils of war and not out of Zakat funds.<br><br>In 
my opinion there is nothing to show that the expenses for winning over hearts 
have been made unlawful for ever up to the Last Day. There is no doubt that the 
action taken by Hadrat `Umar was absolutely right, for if and when the Islamic 
State does not consider it necessary to spend anything under this head, Islam 
does not make it obligatory to spend something for `winning hearts'. On the 
other hand, if need for this arises at any time, it is authorized to incur 
expenses under this head for Allah has kept a provision for this. Hadrat `Umar 
and the other Companions agreed only on this that there was no need to give 
anything for this purpose at that time because the circumstances did not warrant 
it. But there is no reason to conclude from this that the Companions disallowed 
for ever the expenses that were permitted by the Qur'an under certain 
circumstances for the good of Islam.<br><br>As regards the opinion of Imam 
Shafi`i, it appears to be correct in so far as it is not lawful to spend 
anything under this head out of Zakat Funds, if these expenses can be met out of 
other funds. But if it is necessitated that something should be spent under this 
head out of Zakat Funds, there is no reason why a differentiation should be made 
in this regard between sinful Muslims and unbelievers. For the Qur'an has not 
allocated the share because of the faith of the prospective recipients but 
because Islam required to win their hearts for its own good and because this 
could not be achieved except by giving them a portion of wealth. Therefore the 
Qur'an allows the Amir of the Believers to spend a part of the Zakat Funds to 
achieve this end, if, when and where the required conditions exist. The fact 
that the Holy Prophet did not spend anything from the Zakat Funds on unbelievers 
for this purpose does not mean that it is unlawful to do so, for he did not 
spend from this fund because there was enough money in other funds for this 
purpose. Had it been unlawful to spend anything from Zakat Funds on unbelievers, 
he would have explicitly forbidden it. <br><br>65A portion of Zakat Funds may be 
spent for the ransoming of slaves in two ways. First, help may be given to a 
slave for the payment of the ransom money, if he enters into an agreement with 
his master that he will set him free, if the slave pays him a certain amount of 
money. The second way is that the Islamic government may itself pay the price of 
Iris freedom and set him at liberty. There is a consensus of opinion about the 
first way, but there is difference of opinion about the second way. Hadrat 'Ali, 
Said bin Jubair, Laith Thauri, Ibrahim Nakh`i, Sha'abi; and Muhammad bin Sirin, 
Hanafis and Shafi'' is consider this as unlawful while Ibn, 'Abbas, Hasan Basri, 
Malik, Ahmad and Abu Thaur consider this as lawful expenditure from this Fund.<br>
<br>66Help may be given out of Zakat Funds to such debtors as would be reduced 
to a state of poverty, if they paid off all their debts out of their own 
possessions, irrespective of the fact whether they are earning any money or not, 
whether they are indigent in the general sense or well off. According to some 
Jurists, the only exceptions to this are those debtors who are spendthrifts or 
involve themselves in debts by spending money on wicked deeds. Help may be given 
to them only if and when they repeat. <br><br>67"The Way of Allah" is a general 
term which unplies all those good works which please Allah. That is why some 
Jurists are of the opinion that Zakat Funds may be spent on every kind of good 
work. But the fact is, and the majority of the earliest Muslim scholars have 
opined, that here the 'Way of Allah' stands for Jihad in the Way of Allah, that 
is, the struggle to eradicate the systems based on kufr and to establish the 
Islamic system in their stead. Therefore the Zakat Fund may be utilised to meet 
the expenses of the journeys the people make, or for procuring means of 
conveyance, equipment, weapons and other articles needed for Jihad, irrespective 
of the fact whether they are so well off or not as to need any help fur personal 
requirements. Likewise help of a temporary or permanent nature may also be given 
to those people who devote the whole of their time and energies, temporarily or 
permanently, for this work<br><br>It should also be noted that there has arisen 
a misunderstanding regarding the "Way of Allah," for the early scholars usually 
use for Jihad the Arabic word as (ghazyah) which is synonymous with "fight". 
They, therefore, are of the opinion that Zakat Fund may only be used for the 
purpose of fighting. But Jihad in the Way of Allah is a much more comprehensive 
term than mere fighting in the Way of Allah. Jihad applies to all those efforts 
that are made to degrade the word of kufr and to exalt the Word of Allah and to 
establish the Islamic System of life, whether by propagating the Message of 
Allah in the initial stage or by fighting in the final stage of the struggle.<br>
<br>68Help from Zakat Fund may be given to a wayfarer on a journey even though 
he might be quite well off at home.<br><br>Some of the Jurists are of the 
opinion that according to this verse only that wayfarer who does not undertake a 
journey for a sinful purpose may be helped out of Zakat Funds. But no such 
condition has been laid down in the Qur'an or the Hadith to this effect. Besides 
this, we learn from the fundamental principles of Islam that the sins of a needy 
person would in no way prevent us from helping him As a matter of fact such a 
help may prove very useful in reforming sinful and depraved persons. For if they 
get a support in the tithe of need, it may reasonably be expected that they 
would turn towards purifying their souls.<br><br>69This was one of the charges 
which the hypocrites leveled against the Holy Prophet. As he used to listen to 
everyone and let him say freely whatever he had to say, they would find fault 
with him, saying, "He is a credulous person. Everyone can approach him freely 
and may say whatever he pleases, and he readily believes whatever he hears!" 
Though it was a good thing that he heard everyone, the hypocrites intentionally 
spread it as a vice, so that the poor and humble Muslims should be kept away 
from coming near the Holy Prophet. The hypocrites did not like that these true 
Believers should inform the Holy Prophet about their plots, mischiefs and 
hostile talks. They resented it very much that the Holy Prophet listened to and 
believed in the talk of these humble people against such "respectable" people as 
they.<br><br>70The answer to this charge implies two things. First, "Though the 
Prophet listens to everything, he attends only to that which is good and is for 
the welfare of the Community, for he is not the one who would listen to or 
encourage mischievous things." Secondly, "It is good for yourselves that he 
listens patently to everyone; otherwise he would not have allowed you to put 
forward lame excuses for your negligence from the struggle in the Way of Allah. 
Had he not been forbearing, he would not have paid attention to your false 
professions of faith and hypocritical expressions of good wishes for Islam, but 
would have taken you to task for your mischiefs and made it difficult for you to 
live at Al-Madinah. It is thus obvious that it is good for you that he listens 
to everyone." <br><br>71That is, "You are wrong that he listens to everyone. He 
puts his trust only in the true Believers. Accordingly, he believed only in 
those things about you that were conveyed to him by good and trustworthy people, 
who were neither liars nor tale-bearers. Therefore, whatever they said about you 
was true and should leave been taken as true."<br><br>72The hypocrites were 
afraid that their secret plans would be disclosed in the Qur'an to their great 
discomfort. Though they did not believe that the Holy Prophet was a Messenger of 
Allah, they were convinced from their experience of the last nine years or so 
that he possessed some supernatural powers by which he learned their hidden 
secrets, and revealed these through the Qur'an (which according to them was 
written by himself). <br><br>73This refers to the hypocrites who used to make 
fun of the Holy Prophet and the true Muslims in their secret meetings when they 
were making preparations for the expedition to Tabuk. In this way, they used to 
discourage those Muslims who sincerely and honestly intended to go forth for 
Jihad. We learn many things in this connection from the traditions. For 
instance, in one of their meetings, when the hypocrites were having a gossip, 
one of them remarked, "I say! Do you think that the Romans are no better than 
the Arabs ? You will see that in the near future these "brave" men will be bound 
with ropes." Another responded to this, "What a fun it would be if after this 
each one of them is lashed with a hundred stripes! " Still another, ridiculing 
the preparations by the Prophet for the expedition, remarked, "Look at this man, 
and his preparations! He intends to go forth to conquer the forts in Syria and 
the Roman Empire."<br><br>74That is, "Those foolish buffoons, who take interest 
in such conversations and mock even at serious things because there is nothing 
serious in the world for them, may be pardoned. But there are others who mock at 
these serious things deliberately with evil intentions, because they consider 
the Messenger and the Way taught by him as ridiculous in spite of their 
professions of Faith. As their real object is to discourage the believers from 
making preparations for Jihad, they are criminals and not buffoons; therefore 
they shall not be pardoned at all."<br><br>75These are the common 
characteristics of all hypocrites. All of them are interested in evil and 
inimical to good. If some one undertakes to do an evil thing, they would 
dedicate all their sympathies, counsels encouragements contributions. good 
wishes, praises and their approvals to such a one. They would join hands co 
accomplish that evil thing and persuade others to take part in it and encourage 
tire doer in every way. Moreover, they would show in every way their hearty 
pleasure if they perceived that that evil thing was progressing satisfactorily. 
On the other hand, if someone undertakes to do a good thing, they are shocked to 
Bear the very news of it for it pains their hearts; nay, they do not even like 
that such a thing should be undertaken at all. Then if they see some one coming 
forward to help it, they feel very uncomfortable and try their worst to hinder 
him from it and if he does not give it up, they would wish that he should fail 
in it. Then all of them have this common characteristic that they do not spend 
anything at all for good ends irrespective of the fact whether they be otherwise 
parsimonious or generous. At any rate, their wealth is either for hoarding or 
for evil deeds. As a matter of fact, they would spend large sums on evil works 
generously but would not be willing to spend a farthing for good things.<br><br>
76In the preceding verse, they were being mentioned in the third person, but 
here they are being addressed directly in the second person.<br><br>77Again they 
are being mentioned in the third person.<br><br>78These were the people of Lot.<br>
<br>79"They wronged themselves" for they were themselves responsible for their 
destruction. Allah had no enmity with them and had no desire to destroy them. As 
a matter of fact, they themselves adopted the way of life that led to 
destruction, whereas Allah had sent His Messengers to them and afforded them the 
opportunities of thinking, understanding and reforming. His Messengers 
admonished and warned them of the consequences of treading wrong paths, and 
presented very clearly before there the Way that leads to success, and also the 
ways that lead to destruction. But when they did not benefit from the 
opportunities that were offered to them to mend their ways, and persisted in 
treading the ways that led to destruction, they inevitably met with the end for 
which they were heading. And this horrible end was not due to Allah's will to be 
unjust to theta but due to their own evil doings."<br><br>80The contrast between 
the characteristics of the hypocrites (v. 67) and of the true Believers (v. 71) 
clearly shows that the two are entirely different from each other, in spite of 
their outwardly similar profession of faith in Islam and obedience to it. The 
difference lies in their morals, conducts, habits, attitudes and ways of 
thinking. On the one hand are the hypocrites whose tongues are never tired of 
professing faith in Islam, but who are void of sincere faith, and whose whole 
conduct belies their professions. They are, as it were, like bottles which have 
labels of "musk", but contain cow-dung which may easily be recognized from its 
appearance and unpleasant odor. On the other hand are the true Believers, who 
are like those bottles which contain musk which may be tested in any way-by its 
appearance, its smell and other characteristics-to be musk. Likewise, though the 
outward label of Islam apparently makes both of them one community of Muslims, 
the real characteristics of the hypocritical Muslims are so different from those 
of the true Muslims that they have, in fact, become two different communities. 
The hypocritical Muslims, men and women, form a separate community with those 
who have similar characteristics. They all are neglectful of Allah, take 
interest in evil things and deviate from all that is good and never co-operate 
with tare Believers and, in short, they are allies to one another and 
practically dissociate themselves from true Believers and form a group of their 
own. In contrast to them, the true Believers, men and women, have practically 
become one community. All of them take interest in what is good, and abhor what 
is evil: they remember Allah day and night and cannot think of life without the 
constant remembrance of Allah; they are very generous in spending in the Way of 
Allah, and obey Him and His Messenger without any mental reservations. These 
common characteristics have dissociated them from the hypocrites and united them 
in one Community and trade them allies to one another."<br><br>81From here 
begins !he third discourse that was sent down after the expedition to Tabuk.<br>
<br>82This Command enunciated the change of policy towards the hypocrites. Up to 
this time, leniency was being shown to them for two reasons. First, the Muslims 
had not as yet become so powerful as to take the risk of an internal conflict in 
addition to the one with the external enemies. The other reason was to give 
trough respite to those people who were involved in doubts and suspicions so 
that they could get sufficient time for attaining to faith and belief. But now 
the time had come far a change of policy. The whole of Arabia had been subdued 
and a bitter conflict with the external enemies was about to start; therefore it 
was required that these internal enemies should be crushed down so that they 
should not be able to conspire with the external enemies to stir up any internal 
danger to the Muslims. And now it had become possible to crush them. As regards 
!he second reason, these hypocrites had been given respite for a period of nine 
years to observe, to consider and test the Right Way, and they could have 
availed of it, if they had any good in them. So there was no reason why any more 
leniency should be shown to them. Therefore, Allah enjoined the Muslims to treat 
the hypocrites on one and the same level with the disbelievers and start Jihad 
against them, and to give up the policy of leniency Grey had adopted towards 
them and adopt a fine and stern policy instead.<br><br>In this connection, it 
should also be noted that this verse does not enjoin the Muslims to fight with 
the hypocrites. It merely meant to end the policy of leniency that had hitherto 
been adopted towards them. This verse enjoined that they were no more to be 
considered a part and parcel of the Muslim community nor were they to be allowed 
to take part in the management of its affairs nor consulted about any matter, so 
that they might not be able to spread the poison of hypocrisy. This changed 
policy required that the true Believers should expose all those, who adopted a 
hypocritical attitude and conduct and showed in any way that they were not 
sincere allies to Allah, His Messenger and the true Muslims. Each and every one 
of such hypocrites should be openly criticized and reproved so that there should 
remain for them no more place of honor and trust in the Muslim society: they 
should be socially boycotted and kept away from the consultations of the 
Community: their evidence in the courts of law should be regarded as 
untrustworthy: the doors of offices and positrons of trust should be closed 
against them and they should be held in contempt in the social meetings. In 
short; every Muslim should show by his behavior to such a one that there was no 
place of honor or respect or trust for a hypocrite in the Muslim society. 
Besides this, if any one of them was found to be guilty of treachery, there 
should be no connivance at his crime, nor should he be pardoned but openly tried 
in a court of law and should be duly punished.<br><br>This Command was urgently 
needed at the time it came. It was obvious that in order to save the Muslim 
Community from fall and degradation, it was essential to purge it of all the 
internal dangers to its solidarity, because a Community, which nourishes 
hypocrites and traitors and allows the internal enemies to flourish with honor 
and security, wall inevitably be doomed to moral degradation and ultimate 
destruction. Hypocrisy is a plague and a hypocrite is the rat that carries and 
spreads its germs. Therefore to allow him the freedom of movement in the society 
is to expose the whole population to the danger of hypocrisy. Likewise, to give 
a place of honor and prestige to a hypocrite is to encourage many others in 
hypocrisy and treachery, for this shows that it is not sincerity, true faith and 
its welfare that count in it. One may flourish and prosper in it even if one 
verbally professes ;o be a Muslim and at the same time indulges in dishonesty 
and treachery. The Holy Prophet has expressed the same thing in a pithy saying. 
He said, "Whoso honors and respects the inventor of new practices which are 
un-Islamic, indeed helps to demolish the very structure of Islam." <br><br>83We 
cannot say with certainty what that "word of unbelief" was which they had 
uttered. There are, however, traditions that mention several things of unbelief 
which were uttered by the hypocrites during that time. For instance, it is 
related that a hypocrite, while he was talking to a young Muslim, a near 
relative of his, said, "If all that this man (referring to the Holy Prophet) is 
saying be true, then we are worse than donkeys." Another tradition relates that 
when, during the expedition to Tabuk, one of the she-camels of the Holy Prophet 
went astray and the Muslims were moving about in search of it, a party of the 
hypocrites made a good deal of fun of this, saying to one another, "(Just 
consider the Prophethood of this man! ) He tells news of heavens but cannot tell 
where his she-camel is!'<br><br>84This is a reference to the plots which the 
hypocrites had made during the Tabuk expedition. On the return journey they 
conspired to pus!' the Holy Prophet down into some ravine, while he would be 
passing over some hill at night. The Holy Prophet got wind of the plot and 
ordered that the army should take the longer route through the valley round the 
hills, while he himself along with 'Ammar-bin-Yasir and Huzaifah-bin-Yaman would 
make the short-cut over the hi" . While they were on the way, suddenly they 
discovered that a dozen of the hypocrites, with covered faces, were following 
them. At this Hadrat Huzaifah tented towards them so that he may drive away 
their camels but they were terrified when they saw him coming towards them and 
took to flight lest they should be recognized.<br><br>The other plot was to 
declare `Abdullah bin Ubayy as king at Al-Madinah as soon as they should hear 
some 'bad news' about the Muslim army, because according to their expectations, 
the Holy Prophet and his faithful Companions could never fare well against tire 
armies of the Great Roman Empire. <br><br>85This is an insinuation to put to 
shame by an indirect suggestion the hypocrites of AI-Madinah. This refereed to 
the prosperity of Al-Madinah and its peoples, for Al-Madinah was a small town 
before the migration of the Holy Prophet to it, and its two clans-Aus and 
Khazraj-did not hold any high position in regard to wealth or prestige. But 
within the short period of nine years or so, this small town became the capital 
of Arabia because of the residence of the Holy Prophet and the sacrifices of the 
Ansar, the true Muslims. As a result of this, the former peasants-Aus and 
Khazraj of AI-Madinah became the `Great Ones' of the Islamic State and wealth 
began to flow into this central city on account of spoils of war and increased 
commercial activity. The hypocrites were rebuked in this verse that, instead of 
being grateful to the Holy Prophet, they showed anger and spite against him for 
no other "sin" than that he had brought forth prosperity among them.<br><br>
86This is an instance of their ingratitude for which the hypocrites were rebuked 
in v. 74.<br><br>They broke their covenant with Allah which enjoined them to 
spend money in charity, if Allah enriched Them by His bounty. This shows that 
they were confirmed criminals and they did not care in the least for the 
agreements they made, and were niggardly and had no moral code to observe. <br>
<br>87This refers to the mean conduct which the hypocrites evinced on the 
occasion of the appeal of the Holy Prophet for contributions towards the Tabuk 
expedition. The well-to-do hypocrites did not themselves make any contributions, 
but when the sincere Muslims came forward with generous contributions according 
to their means, they began to deride them. If a well-to-do Muslim made a 
handsome contribution, they would at once accuse him to be guilty of a 'showoff 
. On the other hand, if a poor Muslim contributed a paltry sum which he could 
hardly spare after sacrificing some of the barest necessities of his family or 
contributing the small earnings obtained by hard work, they would at once 
ridicule, saying, `Lo! Here is the farthing that will help conquer the forts of 
the Roman Empire!" <br><br>88This verse was sent down to prevent the Holy 
Prophet from saying funeral prayers for 'Abdullah bin Ubayy, the ringleader of 
the hypocrites, who died a short while after the Tabuk Expedition. His son 
'Abdullah who was a sincere Muslim called on the Holy Prophet and requested him 
to give his shirt for his father's shroud. The Holy Prophet very generously 
granted his request. Then he begged the Holy Prophet to lead his father's 
funeral prayer. The Holy Prophet agreed to this also but Hadrat 'Umar very 
respectfully requested him repeatedly not to do so, saying, "O Prophet of Allah! 
will you say funeral prayer for a person who was guilty of such and such crimes 
and sins"? The Holy Prophet, who was a blessing both for friends and for foes, 
got ready to say funeral prayer even for that man who was a deadly enemy of 
Islam. At last when he stood up to lead the funeral prayer, this verse was sent 
down to prevent him from this by a direct Command from God, in accordance with 
the changed policy declared in v. 73 which forbade to do anything that might 
encourage the hypocrites among the Muslims.<br><br>The above incident led to the 
formulation of the regulation that the leaders and prominent people from among 
the Muslims should neither lead nor offer the funeral prayers of the sinners 
against Islam or for those notorious for their disobedience to Islam. After 
this, whenever a request was made to the Holy Prophet for a funeral prayer, he 
would first inquire about the conduct of the deceased person. If he came to know 
that he was a bad person, he would say to his people, "You may perform his 
burial just as you like".<br><br>89"...they do not understand anything now," for 
they deliberately and intentionally chose the shameful way of staying at home 
with women, when they were required to go forth for Jihad, though they were 
healthy, physically fit and well-to-do, and professed Islam. Therefore, 
according to the Divine Law of Nature. a seal was set upon their hearts and they 
were bereft of those noble feelings which make one feel ashamed of adopting such 
a disgraceful conduct. <br><br>90Here the word "Bedouins" refers to those Arabs 
who lived in the desert near Al-Madinah.<br><br>91The hypocritical profession of 
Islam has been called the way of unbelief, because that profession of faith 
which lacks practical proof, surrender, sincerity and obedience, is, in fact, 
unbelief. As such persons prefer their own interests and worldly desires to 
Allah and His Way, they shall be dealt with by Allah as unbelievers and rebels, 
even if they could not be legally treated as such in this world but were 
considered Muslims due to their profession of faith. This is because in the life 
of this world, the Islamic Law treats as unbelievers only such hypocrites as are 
guilty of open unbelief, rebellion, treachery or infidelity. That is why there 
are many cases of hypocrisy that do not come under kufr in the Islamic Shari'ah. 
However, this does not mean that if one escaped the penalty according to the 
Islamic Code, one will escape punishment According to the Divine Judgment also.
<br><br>92This implies that even those people who are otherwise excusable 
because of disability, sickness or indigence will be pardoned only if they are 
sincerely and truly faithful to Allah and His Messenger. Without this fidelity, 
no one shall be pardoned merely because he was sick or indigent at the time when 
he was called upon to go forth for Jihad. For Allah does not judge merely by 
appearances and treat alike and forgive all those who present "medical 
certificates" of their disability because of sickness, old age or some other 
physical defect. On the Day of Judgment, He will examine minutely the heart of 
each and everyone, and take into account his whole conduct, open and hidden, and 
will consider whether his excuse was of a faithful servant or of a traitor and 
rebel. It is obvious that each and every case, in spite of apparent similarity, 
requires a separate and different judgment. For instance, let us take the case 
of two men who suddenly fell ill on the eve of Jihad. One of them thanked his 
lucky stars for the timely disease, as if to say, "How lucky it is that I have 
fallen ill on the opportune moment! Otherwise, this calamity of Jihad could not 
have been avoided and I would have had to suffer it anyhow." On the contrary, 
the other man was filled with sorrow at his illness, and he cried in anguish, 
"Ah! what a bad luck! I have been attacked by this sudden disease at the time 
when I ought to have been in the battle-field instead of lying down here in 
bed!" One of them made his illness not only an excuse for exemption from Jihad 
but also tried to dissuade others from it. On the contrary, the other one, 
though lying in the sick-bed, went on urging his own dear relatives, friends and 
others to go forth to Jihad; nay, he entreated even those who were attending 
him, saying, "Leave me in the care of the Real Master, and go forth to Jihad. I 
am sure that the arrangements for my nursing will be made somehow or other: 
therefore you should not waste your precious chance for my sake but go forth and 
serve the Right Way." But the other, who stayed at home, spent all this time in 
spreading discontent and bad news and in damaging war efforts and in disrupting 
the affairs of the families of the fighters. The other man in similar 
circumstances did his very best to make the home front as strong as he could. 
Though these two men had similar excuses for exemption, they cannot be 
considered as equal in the sight of Allah: the second one only may expect 
Allah's pardon, and not the first man who was a traitor and rebel against Allah, 
though he might have had a genuine excuse for exemption.<br><br>93Such people as 
felt a strong urge for Jihad but could not join it because of some really 
genuine excuse, will be counted by Allah among those who actually took part in 
it, even though they could not join it in person and do anything practically for 
it. This is because they were sincerely grieved at their absence from Jihad for 
no fault of theirs, just as a man of the world would be grieved if he were 
deprived of some lucrative business or of some high profit. Allah considers such 
a one as on duty, because his heart was serving in the Way of Allah, though he 
had been deprived of active service on account of some genuine excuse. The Holy 
Prophet, while returning from Tabuk, stated the same thing like this: "There are 
some people at Al-Madinah (at this time) who have been traveling and marching 
all along with you through every valley. Naturally the Companions to whom he was 
speaking were wonder struck at this. So they asked, "While staying at 
Al-Madinah?" He replied, "Yes, while staying at AI-Madinah! This is because they 
were compelled by the circumstances to stay behind at AI-Madinah: otherwise they 
would certainly have accompanied you. "<br><br>94The Arabic words and are of the 
same root but have different senses in the two sentences in which they occur. In 
the first sentence it means, "... so that you may turn away from them and 
forbear them and may not take them to task ...." In the second sentence it 
means, "... so turn away from them and break off all connections with them and 
have nothing to do with them, as if you had broken off completely with them,, 
and they with you.''<br><br>95As has already been stated in E.N. 90, the 
"Bedouins" here refers to those rustic Arabs of the desert who had settled in 
the suburbs of Al-Madinah.<br><br>The background which may help one to 
comprehend the meanings of the verse is this. Though these people had outwardly 
embraced Islam, they had not done so from conviction. When they saw the rising 
of the organized power of Islam in Al-Madinah, they were so overawed by it that 
they could not ignore it. So at first they adopted the attitude of the 
opportunists towards the conflict between Islam and kufr. But when the power of 
the Islamic Government spread over the major portions of Hijaz and Najd, and the 
power of its enemy clans began to decline, they thought it expedient to enter 
the fold of Islam. But there were very few among them who had sincerely accepted 
Islam from the conviction that it was the Right Way. That is why they did not 
make any sincere efforts to fulfill the implications of the true Faith, and 
observe the obligatory duties imposed by Islam. On the contrary, the majority of 
them had accepted Islam just because it was the best policy for them. They 
merely desired to take advantages of being "Muslims" in order to gain those 
benefits to which they were entitled as members of the ruling party, without 
performing those duties which became obligatory on them by the very acceptance 
of Islam. Therefore they were utterly averse to saying the prescribed Prayers, 
observing the Fast, paying the Zakat dues from their date palm gardens and their 
herds of cattle. Moreover, they smarted under the discipline of the Islamic 
State and resented being subdued by any power for the first time in history. 
Above all, it was against their very nature to make sacrifices of their lives 
and wealth in the Way of Allah, as was being demanded by Islam, for they were 
accustomed to fight only for plunder and spoils. That is why they always 
invented one excuse or the other for exemption from the restrictions and 
obligations that were being imposed on them. For they had no interest in the 
Truth or the welfare of humanity; their only concern was their camels and their 
goats, that is, the narrow world around their tents. As regards anything higher 
than these, the only thing which they could believe in was irrational reverence 
for those who would guarantee their worldly welfare and protect them from 
calamities and give them amulets to safeguard them against haram and evil, and 
say prayers for them as a recompense for their offerings to them. Hut they were 
not prepared to accept any faith or belief that would bring under its moral and 
legal discipline every aspect of their cultural, social and economic life, and 
demand from them the sacrifices of lives and wealth for the cause of a universal 
reform.<br><br>In this verse, the above-mentioned mental and moral condition of 
the Bedouins has been described like this: "These Bedouins are more hypocritical 
than the urban Arabs and are more stubborn and obdurate in their denial of the 
Truth. This is because the urban people make use of the opportunities of meeting 
the learned and pious people and thus learn the laws and regulations of the Way. 
On the other hand, in all probability, the Bedouins will learn little about the 
Divine Way, because they get few opportunities for this. Moreover, they lead 
lives of "economic animals" rather than of human beings having moral and 
spiritual values; therefore they do not think of higher things than their animal 
urges.<br><br>It should also be noted that the main cause of the subsequent 
storm of rebellion and apostasy during the caliphate of Hadrat Abu Bakr two 
years after the revelation of these verses (97-99) was the same that has been 
mentioned therein.<br><br>96This means that they regarded the payment of Zakat 
dues as a fine and the expenditure on hospitality, an Islamic duty, a penalty. 
Likewise, if they had to make any contributions towards Jihad, they did so to 
show that they were loyal to the Islamic State and not because they wanted to 
please Allah by giving sincere monetary help for His cause.<br><br>97They had 
become so expert in the art of hiding their hypocrisy that even the Holy Prophet 
could not recognize them, though he possessed immense sagacity and insight into 
human nature; so Allah informed him about them. <br><br>98This double 
chastisement will be the loss of their worldly advantages and the victory of the 
Islamic Mission in the teeth of their opposition. Thus one chastisement shall be 
the loss of their worldly benefits for which they practiced deceptions and 
adopted hypocritical attitudes, and instead of gaining wealth, honor and 
prestige they shall meet with disgrace and utter failure. The second 
chastisement will be in the shape of the victory of the Islamic Mission to 
defeat which they exerted their utmost by their machinations and plots. But the 
Islamic Mission will come out successful in the teeth of their evil wishes, 
desires, intentions and vicious efforts and they themselves shall witness its 
victory to their utter despair, regret, grief and sorrow. <br><br>99In this 
passage a clear line of demarcation has been drawn between the hypocritical 
"Muslims" and the true Muslims, and instructions have been given regarding the 
treatment that should be meted out to the hypocrites. Therefore, the one who 
claims to be a Muslim but dots not sincerely devote himself to Allah, His Way 
and the Islamic Community, should be severely dealt with, if there is a clear 
proof, from his conduct, that he lacks sincerity; or if he offers anything in 
the Way of Allah, it should be rejected forthwith: or when he dies the Muslims 
should neither join his funeral prayer nor beg God's pardon for him, even though 
he be one's father or brother. In contrast to this, if a believer is guilty of 
some sin and confesses it, he should be pardoned, and his offerings should be 
accepted and prayers should be said for his forgiveness.<br><br>As regards the 
criterion by which it will be judged whether one is or is not a hypocrite, 
though one might have been guilty of an act of insincerity, three things have 
been implied in this passage:<br><br>(1) A sincere follower will openly and 
clearly confess his sin without offering any lame excuses and giving false 
explanations and interpretations of his offense.<br><br>(2) It will be judged 
from his previous conduct whether he was a habitual offender or he committed the 
sin on the spur of the moment because of some weakness. If he had been behaving 
like a righteous Muslim and if his record showed sincere services, sacrifices 
and good deeds to his credit, it will be reasonably concluded that he was not a 
hypocrite.<br><br>(3) His future conduct will be watched to see whether his 
confession was verbal or there had really been a change of heart. If he 
sincerely feels sorry for his sin and is anxious to compensate for it and his 
whole conduct shows that he intends to eradicate the root cause of the weakness 
in his Faith that misled him into the sin, it will be concluded that he 
sincerely feels sorry for his sin and that he was not a hypocrite but a sinful 
believer.<br><br>The event that is connected with the occasion on which this 
passage was sent down, makes this subject quite clear. It is related by the 
scholars of Traditions that these verses were revealed in regard to Abu Lubabah 
bin `Abdul Manzar and his Companions. Hadrat Abu Lubabah was one of those people 
who had embraced Islam on the occasion of the Oath of Allegiance at `Aqabah 
before the migration of the Holy Prophet to Al-Madinah. He had taken part in the 
battles of Badr, Uhd and other campaigns. But on the occasion of the Tabuk 
Expedition, he succumbed to some inner weakness and stayed at home without any 
genuine and lawful excuse. The same was the case of the other six Companions, 
who were sincere Muslims. When the Holy Prophet returned from Tabuk and they 
came to know that Allah and His Messenger had a very bad opinion of those who 
had stayed behind, they were filled with shame and regret. Therefore they tied 
themselves to a pillar even before they were called upon to explain their 
conduct. Then they declared, "We will neither eat anything nor sleep unless we 
are pardoned or die in the same condition." After some days they fell down in an 
unconscious condition because of hunger and sleeplessness. When at last they 
were informed that Allah and His Messenger had pardoned them, they went to see 
the Holy Prophet and said, `Sir, we request you to accept from us as 
propitiatory offerings our houses and the whole of our possessions. As these 
were responsible for our sin of omission, we desire to give them away in the Way 
of Allah. "But the Holy Prophet replied, "There is no need to give the whole of 
your property for only one-third of it will suffice."<br><br>A deep 
consideration of this event clearly brings out the kind of weaknesses that are 
pardonable. All of these people were not habitual offenders and defaulters. 
Their whole past conduct showed that they were sincere Muslims: none of them 
invented false explanations to excuse themselves but confessed their sin. By 
offering the whole of their properties as. propitiatory offerings, they proved 
that they were really sorry for their conduct and wanted to atone for their sin.<br>
<br>In this connection, another important lesson should also be learned from 
these verses. In order to atone for one's sins, one should give a practical 
proof along with the verbal confession and heartfelt regret. One way of this is 
to give charity in the Way of Allah for this helps to cleanse the filth which 
was being nourished in the heart and which was responsible for the sin. This not 
only eradicates the hidden evil but also increases the capacity for good works. 
For the confession of one's sin is like the feeling of one who has fallen into a 
pit. He at once realizes that he is in a critical situation in a pit, where he 
does not like to abide, and is troubled over it. Therefore he thinks out plans 
for getting out of it and makes practical efforts for this. Likewise the one who 
confesses his sin and feels ashamed of it and takes practical steps to atone for 
it by making offerings and doing other good works, intends to come out of the 
pit of sin.<br><br>100"... then you shall return to Allah ...." Who is the 
ultimate judge of everything and from Whom nothing can be concealed. Therefore 
even if one succeeds in hiding one's hypocrisy in this world or is judged to be 
up to the standard in one's Faith and sincerity, it does not mean in any way 
that such a one will succeed in escaping chastisement for hypocrisy in the 
Hereafter also.<br><br>101The case of these people had been deferred because it 
could not yet be legally decided whether they were sinners or hypocrites and not 
because their case was doubtful in the sight of Allah. This was because the 
symptoms of their diseases had not as yet come to the surface to indicate 
clearly which of the two they were. For Islam teaches the Muslims not to pass 
judgment on a person or a party unless they possess definite knowledge based on 
conscious reasoning and not on intuition and the like to support it. <br><br>
102" . . the one in conflict . . . Messenger" was Abu `Amir who belonged to the 
clan of Aus of Al-Madinah. He had become Christian monk during the period of 
`ignorance' before the migration of the Holy Prophet and was well-known as a 
scholar of the Scriptures and was held in great reverence as a pious monk. But 
his scholarship and asceticism, instead of leading him to the Truth, became 
hindrance in the way. That was why he not only rejected Islam but also became a 
bitter enemy of the Holy Prophet and his Mission, for he took the Prophet for a 
rival in the "holy business" of priesthood. At first he ignored the Holy Prophet 
and his Mission in the hope that the power of the Quraish would suffice to crush 
him and his Mission. But when the Quraish suffered an utter defeat in the battle 
of Badr, he could no longer ignore it, so he started a vigorous vicious campaign 
against the Islamic Movement. Accordingly he left Al-Madinah and visited . 
different clans, in order to incite them against Islam, and was one of those who 
brought about the battle of Uhd. It is said that he had got some pits dug in the 
battle-field of Uhd, and that the Holy Prophet fell into one of these and 
received injuries. Then he played an important role in organizing the armies 
which came to invade Al-Madinah in the battle of Ahzab. Likewise this Christian 
Monk took a very active part in giving support to the mushriks against Islam in 
all the subsequent battles up to the battle of Hunain, At last when he realized 
that no power in Arabia could withstand the onslaught of Islam. he left Arabia 
and went to the Roman Caesar in order to warn him of the rising "danger" from 
AI-Madinah. It was because of his efforts that the Caesar began to make 
preparations for invading Arabia, to counteract which the Holy Prophet went 
forth on the expedition to Tabuk.<br><br>Now let us consider the background of 
the building of the `mosque' that was built to harm the Righteous Mission.<br>
<br>A section of the hypocrites of AI-Madinah collaborated wholeheartedly with 
Abu `Amir in all the above-mentioned hostile activities against Islam. They also 
fully agreed with him that he should use his "spiritual" influence to obtain 
military help from the Roman Caesar and the Christian states of northern Arabia. 
Accordingly, when he was preparing to go to the Roman Caesar to urge him to 
invade Arabia. they devised a plan of making a `mosque' of their own to serve as 
a safe meeting place for organizing themselves into a separate party because 
none would suspect that they were carrying on evil activities under the garb of 
religion. Moreover. this `mosque' would serve as an ambush for the agents of Abu 
`Amir who could stay in it as travelers and mendicants without raising any 
suspicion that they were spies of the enemy.<br><br>As there were already two 
mosques in Al-Madinah-one at Quba and the other, Masjid-i-Nabavi, in the city 
obviously there was no need for a third one. The hypocrite's themselves 
understood this: therefore they began to invent "reasons" to show that there was 
really a need for a third mosque. Accordingly, they went to the Holy Prophet and 
said, "We need another `mosque' because it is very difficult for the people of 
this area, especially the old, the sick and the disabled, to offer the five 
prescribed Prayers in either of the two Mosques, during the winter season and 
the rainfall. Therefore we intend to build a new `mosque' only for the 
convenience of those who live at a distance from the two Mosques but are 
desirous of saying their prayers in congregation."<br><br>With such professedly 
pure motives, these mischief makers built the 'mosque' and then went to the Holy 
Prophet with the request, "Sir, please stand in this new 'mosque' and lead the 
congregation in one of the prescribed prayers so as to perform its opening 
ceremony." But the Holy Prophet postponed the matter, saying, "At this time I am 
wholly engaged in making preparations for the expedition to Tabuk. I shall 
consider the matter on my return home. " After this he went forth to Tabuk, and 
they started their nefarious activities. They went on organizing themselves and 
conspiring against Islam in the `mosque' and decided to crown Abdullah-bin-Ubayy 
as their king, as soon as the Muslims would meet with reverses and be utterly 
crushed down by the Romans, as they had expected. But their expectations were 
all frustrated by what happened at Tabuk. Then on the revelation of these verses 
during the return journey at a place, Zi Avan, near AI-Madinah, the Holy Prophet 
dispatched some men to demolish the mosque' before his entry into the city. <br>
<br>103In order to comprehend fully the implications of this simile, let us 
first consider the significance of the Arabic word ~~ (Juruf). This applies to 
the brink of that piece of land which has been undermined by a river or a 
stream, leaving its surface without any support. In this meaningful simile the 
construction of the structure of life on the Godless foundations has been 
compared to that building which is built on the river brink, which has been 
undermined by its water. It is obvious that the ignorant man who builds a 
structure on the surface of such a piece of land, merely because it is a piece 
of land, will not only lose the building but will also lose his own life, for it 
will inevitably fall down into the river along with him because it has nothing 
to support it. Likewise, the one who lays the foundation of the structure of the 
system of his life on the surface of worldly things, without any regard to God's 
fear or His favor which are the only permanent supports of human life, is like 
the man who builds his structure on the surface undermined by the river. For 
such a man himself undermines the structure of his life by his wrong deeds which 
inevitably follow if there is no bed-rock of God's fear and His favor. Therefore 
the surface on which he had built his life would one day inevitably tumble down 
into the abyss of Hell along with the earnings of his whole life. <br><br>
104"The Right Way" that leads to man's real success.<br><br>105That is, these 
hypocrites have deprived their hearts of the capability of receiving and 
accepting faith by the commission of the most heinous sin of building a `mosque' 
to do harm to that very Islam for the propagation of which mosques are built. 
This crime has set the desire of disbelief so deep in their hearts that it will 
remain there as long as they are alive and will leave them only at the time of 
death when their hearts will cease to beat in their breasts. Obviously, the case 
of such people is quite different from that of those unbelievers, who openly 
build idol-temples or openly make preparations for war against God. For it is 
possible that such a one may get Guidance just because he is honest, sincere and 
bold. Moreover, his open antagonism shows that he has the courage of his 
convictions and may, therefore, accept Islam, when he would be convinced of its 
Truth. But there is no hope for that cowardly lying and cunning man who builds a 
'mosque' for the service of kufr and puts on the garb of God-worship for 
fighting against Allah's Way. This is because a conduct like this kills all the 
noble sentiments within him and renders him utterly incapable of understanding 
and accepting Islam.<br><br>106In this verse that aspect of the Islamic Faith 
which determines the nature of the relationship between Allah and His servants 
has been called a transaction. This means that Faith is not merely a 
metaphysical conception but is, in fact, a contract by which the servant sells 
his life and possessions to Allah and in return for this accepts His promise 
that He would give him the Garden in the Life-after-death. In order to 
comprehend the full implications of this transaction, let us first understand 
its nature.<br><br>We should note it well at the outset that, in reality, this 
transaction is not in regard to the actual selling of the life and possessions 
of the servant to Allah in the literal sense, for Allah is in fact the real 
Owner of man's life and possessions. Allah alone has the right o ownership 
because He is the Creator of man and of everything he possesses and uses. 
Therefore there is no question at all of selling and buying in the worldly 
sense; for man possesses nothing of his own to sell, and Allah has no need to 
buy anything because everything already belongs to Him. However, there is one 
thing which has entirely been entrusted to man by Allah, that is, the freedom of 
will and the freedom of choice, and the transaction concerns that thing.<br><br>
Of course, it is true that this freedom does not make any change in the real 
position of man with regard to the right of ownership to his own life and his 
possessions. They belong to Allah Who has delegated to him only the authority to 
use or abuse these things as he wills, without any coercion or compulsion from 
Him. This means that man has been given the freedom to acknowledge or not to 
acknowledge that Allah is the owner of his life and property. The transaction 
mentioned in v. 111 is concerning the voluntary surrender of this freedom to 
Allah's Will. In other words, Allah wills to test man whether he acknowledges 
the ownership of Allah over his life and property, in spite of that freedom, and 
considers himself to be their trustee only, or behaves as if he were their owner 
and so could do whatever he liked with them.<br><br>Thus, the terms of this 
transaction from Allah's side arc these: "If you voluntarily (and not by 
compulsion or coercion) agree to acknowledge that your life, your property and 
everything in this world, which in fact belong to Me, are Mine, and consider 
yourself only as their trustee, and voluntarily surrender the freedom I have 
given you to behave, if you so like, in a dishonest way and yourself become 
their master and owner, I will give you, in return, Gardens in the eternal life 
of the Next World". The one who makes this bargain with Allah is a Believer, for 
Faith is in fact the other name for making this bargain. On the other hand, the 
one who refuses to make this bargain, or after making it adopts the attitude of 
the one who has not made the bargain, is a kafir for, technically, kufr is the 
term applied to the refusal to make this bargain.<br><br>The following are the 
implications of making this transaction:<br><br>(1) Allah has put man to two 
very hard tests in this matter. The first is whether he acknowledges the real 
Owner as owner, in spite of the freedom of choice given to him, or he refuses 
this and becomes ungrateful, treacherous and rebellious. The second test is 
whether he puts his trust in his God or not, and surrenders his freedom and 
sacrifices his desires and wishes in this present world in return for His 
promise of the Gardens and eternal bliss in the Next World, even though the 
world were to proclaim: "A bird in hand is worth two in the bush".<br><br>(2) 
This matter helps to draw a clear line of demarcation between the legal 
conception of the Islamic Faith and the higher and spiritual one according to 
which Allah will judge one in the Hereafter.<br><br>According to its legal 
conception, the mere verbal profession of the articles of the Faith is a 
sufficient proof that one is legally a Muslim and after this no Jurist is 
authorized to declare such a one to be a disbeliever or to expel one from the 
fold of the Islamic Community, unless there is a definite and clear proof that 
the one made a false profession of the Faith. But this is not so with Allah: 
Allah considers the Faith of only that person to be true, who makes this bargain 
with Him and sells his freedom of thought and action to Him and gives up his 
entire claim to ownership in His favor. That is why a man might profess the 
articles of the Faith and observe the prescribed obligatory duties, but if he 
considered himself alone to be the master and owner of his body and soul, his 
heart and brain and his other faculties, his property and his resources and 
other things in his possession, and reserved to himself the right of expending 
them as he willed, he shall be regarded a disbeliever in the sight of Allah, 
even though he should be regarded a believer in the sight of the world. This is 
because such a man has not made that bargain with God which is the essence of 
the Faith according to the Qur'an. The very fact that a man does not expend his 
life and property in the way Allah approves of, or expends these in the way He 
disapproves, shows that the one who claimed to profess the Faith either did not 
sell these to Allah or after having made the transaction still regarded himself 
to be their master and owner.<br><br>(3) The above conception of the Islamic 
Faith draws a clear line of demarcation between the attitude of a Muslim and 
that of a disbeliever towards life. The Muslim, who sincerely believes in Allah, 
surrenders himself completely to Allah's Will, and does nothing whatsoever which 
may show that he is independent in his attitude, except when he temporarily 
forgets the terms of the bargain he has made with Him. Likewise no community of 
the Muslims can collectively adopt an independent attitude in political, 
cultural, economic, social and international matters and still remain Muslim. 
And if sometimes it temporarily forgets its subordinate position and its 
voluntary surrender of its freedom, it will give up the attitude of independence 
and readopt the attitude of surrender, as soon as it becomes aware of its error. 
In contrast to this, if one adopts the attitude of independence towards Allah 
and makes decisions about all the affairs of life in accordance with ones own 
wishes, whims and caprices, one shall be regarded to have adopted the attitude 
of disbelief, even though one was a `Muslim' or a non-Muslim.<br><br>(4) It 
should also be noted well that the Will of God to which a man is required to 
surrender himself is that which is specified by Allah Himself and not the one 
which the man himself declares to be the will of God. For in the latter case one 
does not' follow God's Will but one's own will, which is utterly against the 
terms of the transaction. Only that person (or community) who adopts the 
attitude that conforms to the teachings of His Book and His Messenger, shall be 
deemed to have fulfilled the terms of the transaction.<br><br>From the above 
implications of this transaction, it also becomes clear why the fulfillment of 
the terms by Allah has been deferred to the Next World after the termination of 
the life of this world. It is obvious that the Garden is not the return for the 
mere profession that the buyer has sold his life and property to Allah "but it 
is the actual surrender of these things in the worldly life and their disposal 
by him as a trustee of Allah according to His Will." Thus, this transaction will 
be completed only when the life of the buyer comes to an end in this world and 
it is proved that after making the bargain, he went on fulfilling the terms of 
the agreement up to his last breath. For then and then alone, he will be 
entitled to the recompense in accordance with the terms of the transaction.<br>
<br>It will also be worthwhile to understand the context in which this matter 
has been placed here. In the preceding passage, there was the mention of those 
people who failed in the test of their Faith and did not make the sacrifice of 
their time, money, life and interests for the sake of Allah and His Way, in 
spite of their professions, because of their negligence or lack of sincerity or 
absolute hypocrisy. Therefore after criticizing the attitudes of different 
persons and sections, they have been told in clear words the implications of the 
Faith they had accepted: "This is not the mere verbal profession that there is 
God and He is One, but the acceptance of the fact that He is the Owner and the 
Master of your lives and possessions. Therefore, if you are not ready and 
willing to sacrifice these in obedience to the Command of Allah, but expend 
these and your energies and resources against the Will of Allah, it is a clear 
proof that you were false in your profession of the Faith. For the true 
Believers are those who have truly sold their persons and possessions to Allah, 
and consider Him to be their Owner and Master, and expend their energies and 
possessions without any reservations, where He commands them to expend, and do 
not expend the least of these where He forbids them to expend."<br><br>107Some 
critics say that the statement "this promise is contained in the Torah and the 
Gospel" is not confirmed by these Books. Their objection in regard to the Gospel 
is obviously wrong for even in the existing Gospels there are sayings of Prophet 
Jesus that confirm this verse. For instance:<br><br>"Blessed are they which are 
persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." (MAT. 
5: 10).<br><br>"He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his 
life for my sake shall find it." (MAT. 10: 39).<br><br>"And every one that hath 
forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or 
children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold and shall 
inherit everlasting life." (MAT. 19: 29).<br><br>It is, however, true that the 
matter of this transaction is not confirmed in its entirety by the existing 
Torah. For instance, there is a mention of the first part of the bargain at 
several places in one forth or the other:<br><br>. . .is not he thy father that 
hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?" (DEUT. 32: 6).<br>
<br>"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord 
thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. " 
(DEUT. 6: 4-5).<br><br>But as regards the other part of the bargain, that is, 
the promise of the Gardens, they applied it to the land of Palestine:<br><br>
"Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, 
and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised 
thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey." (DEUT. 6: 3).<br><br>This 
is because the Torah does not give any conception of the Life-after-death, the 
Day of Judgment, Rewards and Punishments in the Here-after, though this creed 
has always been an inseparable part of the Right Way. This does not, however, 
mean that the Torah did not originally contain this creed. The fact is that the 
Jews had become so materialistic during the period of their degeneration that 
they had no other idea of a reward from God than the well-being and prosperity 
in this world. Therefore they perverted all the promises made by God in return 
for man's service and obedience to Him and applied those to the land of 
Palestine.<br><br>In this connection, it should also be noted that the 
above-mentioned changes became possible because the original Torah had been 
tampered with in several ways. Some portions were taken away from it and others 
were added to it. Thus, the Torah in the existing form is not purely the Word of 
God but also contains the comments, etc. , of the Jewish scholars mixed up with 
it. So much so that at some places it becomes difficult to distinguish the Word 
of God from the Jewish traditions, their racial prejudices, their superstitions, 
their ambitions and ,wishes, their legal interpretations, etc., all of which 
have got mixed with the Word of God. (For further details please see E.N. 2 of 
Al-i-Imran).<br><br>108The Arabic word (atta-i-bun) literally means "those who 
repent" . But in the context it occurs it implies "those who possess repentance 
as their permanent characteristic", that is, they repent over and over again. 
Moreover, the literal meaning of (taubah) is "to turn to" or "to turn back" . 
Therefore its explanatory translation will be "....those who turn back to Allah 
over and over again" . This is the first and foremost characteristic of a true 
Believer because even a true Believer is liable to forget the bargain he makes 
with Allah by which he sells his life and property to Him. As this matter does 
not concern his sense organs but pertains to his mind and heart, he is liable to 
forget that these things are not really his property but they belong to Allah. 
Therefore, even the true believer occasionally forgets the bargain, and behaves 
in a way as if he were their owner. But as soon as he becomes conscious of this 
transitory lapse and realizes that he had violated the terms of his agreement, 
he feels sorry and ashamed of his conduct and turns to his God, begs His pardon 
and renews the terms of the bargain with Him, and pledges his allegiance to Him 
after every slip of its violation. This kind of repentance alone is the 
guarantee that one will always come back to one's Faith: otherwise it is not 
possible for man because of the inherent human weaknesses, to observe strictly 
and deliberately the terms of the bargain without ever falling a prey to 
negligence and error. That is why Allah says in praise of the true Believer that 
".....he turns back to Allah over and over again" and not that "he never slips 
into error after making the bargain of obedience and service to Him" . And this 
is the greatest excellence that man can accomplish. Let us now consider the 
wisdom of placing this characteristics first in the list of the characteristics 
of the true Believers. It is to admonish those who had been guilty of crimes 
after the profession of their Faith, They have been told in v. III that the true 
Believers are those who sell their lives and property to Allah. After this they 
are being told that if they sincerely intend to become true Believers they 
should first of all create in themselves this characteristic and at once turn to 
Allah without showing any obduracy so that they should not deviate further into 
error.<br><br>109Some commentators are of the opinion that here (Assn `ihun) 
means " . . . those who observe fast" . As this is not the lexical meaning of 
the word but only its figurative sense, which has been based on an unauthentic 
tradition attributed to the Holy Prophet, we are of the opinion that there is no 
need to depart from its lexical meanings, that is,".....move about in the land 
(for His sake...,... "). For here the Arabic word does not mean merely to 
"...move about in the land" but "move about in the land for the sake of noble 
and high aims, e.g. to propagate Islam, to do Jihad, to emigrate from those 
places where the unbelievers are in power, and to reform the people, to seek 
True Knowledge, to earn a lawful livelihood and the like" . This characteristic 
of the Believers has been especially mentioned here to reprove those who had not 
gone forth to Jihad, in spite of their claim that they were "Believers" . They 
have been admonished that a true Believer is the one who goes forth into the 
land to raise high His Word, and exerts his utmost to fulfill the implications 
of his Faith, and not the one who stays behind when he is called upon to move 
about in the land.<br><br>110That is those who "strictly observe the limits 
prescribed by Allah . . . . . " in regard to the Articles of the Faith, 
worship-morality, social behavior, culture, economics, politics, judiciary, 
peace and war- in short, in all the aspects of their individual and collective 
lives. They neither transgress these limits in order to follow their lusts nor 
invent laws nor replace the Divine Law by other laws. They establish these 
limits and prevent their violations. Hence, the true Believers are those who not 
only strictly observe the limits prescribed by Allah, but also do their very 
best to establish them and safeguard them so as to prevent their violation to 
the best of their powers and capabilities.<br><br>111"It does not behoove . . . 
to pray for the mushriks . . . " implies two things. First, we love them and 
sympathize with them. Secondly, we consider their crime to be pardonable. There 
is no harm to cherish these things for the one who is loyal, though a sinner, 
but it is absolutely wrong in principle to love and sympathize with a person who 
is an open rebel and to consider his case as pardonable as it renders our own 
loyalty doubtful. Besides, it adds to the intensity of the crime, if we pray for 
the forgiveness of a mushrik, who is our near relative. For it means that we 
consider our relationships to be more valuable than the fulfillment of the 
implications of our loyalty to Allah and that our love with Allah. and His Way 
is not wholly unalloyed and that we desire that Allah should also be influenced 
by the love we have with His rebels and pardon our criminal kinsmen, even though 
He should throw the other criminals into the fire of Hell. Obviously, all such 
things are wrong and are against loyalty and sincerity and the Faith demands 
that our love with Allah and His Way should be absolutely unalloyed and that His 
friend should be our friend and His enemy our enemy. That is why Allah has not 
said, "Do not pray for the forgiveness of the mushriks ", but has instead 
warned, It does not behoove the Prophet and those who have believed to pray for 
the forgiveness of the mushriks", which implies this: "The right thing for you 
is that you yourselves should regard it as improper to Show sympathy with Our 
rebels and consider their crime as pardonable: nay, you should not wait for any 
Command from Us about this."<br><br>In this connection, it should also be noted 
well that it is forbidden to show sympathy with the mushriks only in matters of 
Faith. As regards the human relationships that demand the observance of the 
rights of one's own relatives, of showing love, sympathy and kindness, and 
cherishing fellow-feelings with them it is not forbidden at all but it is 
considered to be a virtue. We must fulfill the worldly rights of a relative 
whether he be a believer or a disbeliever: we should help him in affliction and 
give support ,to the needy ones and the orphans and show all possible 'sympathy 
with a sick or wounded person, irrespective of whether he is a Muslim or a 
non-Muslim. <br><br>112The reference is to what Prophet Abraham said when he 
broke off all connections with his father:<br><br>(1).....Peace be upon you. I 
will pray to my Lord to forgive you: for He is very kind to me" . (XIX: 47).<br>
<br>(2) "And forgive my father: indeed he is of those who have gone astray. And 
disgrace me not on the Day, when mankind shall be brought back to life; when 
neither riches nor children shall avail anyone, and none shall obtain salvation 
except the one who comes before his Lord with a sound and pure heart". (XXVI: 
86-89).<br><br>(3). . . . .I will pray for your forgiveness, but I have no power 
to rescue you from Allah . . . . . " (LX: 4).<br><br>In the first place it 
should be noted that even the wording and the tone of the prayer for his father 
were very guarded, but when Prophet Abraham realized that the person for whom he 
was praying was an open rebel against Allah and a bitter enemy of His Way, he 
refrained himself from saying even such a guarded prayer for him and declared in 
clear words that he would have nothing to do with him in future, even though the 
rebel was his father who had brought him up with love and care.<br><br>113The 
words (swab) and (hatim) which the Qur'an uses for Prophet Abraham are very 
comprehensive in meaning. Avvah is the one who is lamenting, humble, weeping, 
grief-stricken and God fearing. And hatim is the one who can keep control over 
himself under all circumstances, and is neither beside himself in anger and 
enmity nor transgresses the proper limits in his affections, friendships and 
relationships. Here both the words have been used in their comprehensive senses. 
Prophet Abraham prayed for his father because he was tender-hearted and lamented 
for him that he would become the fuel for the fire of Hell. As he had full 
control over himself, and was very forbearing, he prayed even for that father 
who had persecuted him cruelly in order to hinder him from the Way of Islam. 
Lastly, he was God fearing and did not want to go beyond the limits in his love 
for his father; so he broke off all his relations with his father when he 
realized that he was an enemy of Allah. <br><br>114"He makes plain to the 
people. . . . " beforehand that they should avoid such and such thoughts, deeds 
and ways. But if they take no heed, and persist in wrong thinking and 
wrongdoing, Allah withholds His guidance from them and lets them follow the 
wrong way they themselves choose to follow.<br><br>This is the general formula 
that helps understand those passages of the Qur'an in which Allah ascribes to 
Himself the guidance and the deviation of the people. Allah's guidance is that 
He makes plain to them the Right Way through His Prophets and Books. Then He 
enables those who have the intention, to follow the Right Way. On the other 
hand, He does not force and compel them to follow the Right Way, if they 
themselves intend to persist in the wrong ways in spite of the fact that the 
Right Way has been made quite clear to them; He rather enables them to follow 
the way they themselves intend to follow.<br><br>As regards the context in which 
this occurs here, it is plain that it is meant to warn those people who have 
been mentioned in the preceding passage, and to introduce those who are .going 
to be mentioned in the succeeding passage. <br><br>115Allah forgave the Prophet 
and his Companions for those inadvertent lapses that had been made in connection 
with the Tabuk expedition, in view of their excellent services. The inadvertent 
lapse made by the Holy Prophet was that he had given leave to stay behind to 
those people who were able to take part in the Jihad. (v. 43).<br><br>116This 
refers to those sincere Companions who were at first somewhat unwilling to go to 
war on that critical occasion, but at last overcame their weakness, for they had 
true Faith in their hearts and loved the Right Way.<br><br>117That is, Allah 
will not take them to account for their wrong inclinations. for He does not 
punish a man for that weakness which he himself has overcome and corrected.<br>
<br>118These Three were among those who came to the Holy Prophet to present 
their excuses for staying behind. More than eighty of them were hypocrites, who 
put forward lame excuses and the Holy Prophet accepted these and let them go. 
Then came the turn of these Three, who were true Believers, and they confessed 
their fault plainly. Therefore the Holy Prophet postponed the decision of their 
case and ordered the Muslims not to have any social relations with them till the 
decision of their cast came from Allah. This verse was sent down to decide their 
case.<br><br>In this connection it should be kept in mind that the case of these 
Three was different from the case of the seven mentioned in E.N. 99. They had 
inflicted the punishment on themselves before they were called to account for 
their fault. <br><br>119The Three whose condition has been described in this 
verse, were Ka`ab bin Malik, Hilal bin Umayyah and Murarah bin Rubai. They were 
sincere Believers, as has been stated above, and had made many sacrifices and 
given proofs of their sincerity before this. The last two had taken part in the 
battle of Badr also, and therefore their Faith was above every kind of 
suspicion. Though Ka'ab had not taken part in the battle of Badr, he had 
accompanied the Holy Prophet in every other expedition. But in spite of all 
these services, they were severely punished for the negligence they had shown on 
the critical occasion of the Tabuk Expedition, when all the able-bodied Muslims 
were commanded to go forth to Jihad.<br><br>When the . Holy Prophet came back 
from Tabuk, he ordered the Muslims to break away completely from them; so much 
so that they should not even respond to their greetings. After forty days of 
this boycott their wives also were ordered to have nothing to do with them. In 
short, they were reduced at AI-Madinah to the same sad plight which has been 
described in this verse. At last, after a boycott of fifty days, this verse was 
sent down to announce their forgiveness.<br><br>The story of the above-mentioned 
boycott has been described in detail by Ka`ab bin Malik, who was one of the 
Three. When he became old and blind, he himself told his story to his son, ' 
Abdullah, who used to accompany him everywhere. As this story is an excellent 
lesson for all, it is given below in Ka`ab's own words:<br><br>"When the Holy 
Prophet urged upon the people to get ready for Jihad, I made up my mind to make 
preparations for this. But when I went home, I became negligent, saying to 
myself, `There is .no hurry: when the time comes I will readily make 
preparations and start forthwith'. In this way I went on putting off my 
preparations till the time came when the army was going to start on the 
Expedition. As I had made no preparations for the journey, I said to myself, `It 
does not matter: 1 will be able to join the army in a couple of days during the 
journey' . But again the same negligence prevented me from putting my intention 
into practice. At last no occasion was left for me to join the army. To add to 
my misery my conscience pricked me over and over again that the people with whom 
I had stayed behind in AI-Madinah were either the hypocrites or those Muslims 
who were old or otherwise unfit for Jihad.<br><br>"When the Holy Prophet came 
back from Tabuk, he, as usual, said two rak'ats of prayer in the Mosque. Then he 
sat there to meet the people. At first, the hypocrites, whose number was a 
little more than eighty, came to him and offered lathe excuses on solemn oaths. 
The Holy Prophet listened to the false story of each of them and accepted their 
apparent excuses and left the decision about their hearts to Allah, saying, `May 
Allah forgive you' . Then it was my turn to put forward my excuse. I went 
forward and uttered my salutations. He smiled and said, `Well, what kept you 
behind?' (I hesitated for a moment.) By God, I would have invented one excuse or 
the other to satisfy any man of the world, for I am well versed in the art of 
conversation. But here was the Holy Prophet who was demanding an explanation 
from me. I believed that even if I succeeded in satisfying him by making a false 
excuse, Allah will inform him of the truth of the case and I shall again incur 
his displeasure. On the other hand, if I told the truth, I expected that Allah 
would forgive me, even though I were to incur his displeasure for the time 
being. So I replied, `Sir, I have no excuse for staying behind. I was in every 
way able to go forth (to Tabuk)' . At this the Holy Prophet remarked, `This is 
the man who has told the truth'. Then turning to me, he said, `Go and wait till 
Allah decides your case'<br><br>"I rose from there and took my seat among the 
people of my own clan. They at once began to tease and reprove me because I had 
made no excuse. At this, I was tempted to go and make some false excuse. But 
when I came to know that there were also two good people (Murarah bin Rubai and 
Hilal bin Umayyah), who had told the same thing that I had, I felt satisfied and 
stuck to the truth.<br><br>"After this the Holy Prophet issued a general order 
that no one should have any kind of talk with us. The other two confined 
themselves to their houses but I used to go out of my house and say my prayers 
in congregation and walk through the bazaars. As nobody spoke to me, it appeared 
to me that I was a foreigner in some strange city where I had no acquaintances. 
When I attended the mosque, I would utter the usual salutations and wait in vain 
for a response from the Holy Prophet. I would turn stealthy looks at him to read 
his thoughts in regard to me, but he would turn his eyes away from me, though he 
had been looking at me while I was engaged in prayer. As this condition became 
intolerable for me, one day I went to see Abu Qatadah who was a cousin of mine 
and a friend from childhood. I climbed over the wall of his garden and uttered 
my salutations, but even he did not make any response to it. Then I said, `O Abu 
Qatadah ! I ask you to tell me on oath whether I love or do not love Allah and 
His Messenger' . But he remained silent. Again I repeated the question but he 
kept silent. I asked him on oath to answer my question. Then he merely replied, 
`Allah and His Messenger know best' . At this my eyes were filled with tears, 
and I came back.<br><br>"Another incident happened during, those days. Once I 
was passing through the bazaar, when a Syrian came to me and gave me a letter 
wrapped in silk. This was from the king of Ghassan and read like this: `We have 
come to know that your Leader is persecuting you these days. As you are not an 
ignoble person, we will not leave you to rot there. Therefore come to us and we 
will honor you (as you deserve)' I said to myself, `Here is another hard trial 
for me' . Then I threw the letter into the burning oven.<br><br>"The boycott 
continued for forty days, when a man brought this message from the Holy Prophet 
that I should separate from my wife. I asked whether I should divorce her but 
was told that I should only separate from her. Accordingly I said to my wife, 
'Go to your parental home and wait till a decision comes from Allah. '<br><br>
"On the fiftieth day, when after the morning prayers, I was sitting in a state 
of utter despair on the top of my house, all of a sudden some one cried aloud, 
`O Ka`ab bin Malik! Please accept my congratulations.' Hearing this, I fell 
prostrate to the ground before Allah, for I understood that the Command of my 
forgiveness had come After this, people began to pour in, each trying to 
forestall the other in congratulating me on the acceptance of my repentance. I 
rose and went directly to the Mosque. I noticed that the face of the Holy 
Prophet was glowing with happiness and in response to my salutations, he said, 
`I congratulate you on this: it is the best day of your life.' I said, `Is this 
forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He replied, `It is from Allah.' Then he 
recited these verses (117-118). I asked, `O Messenger of Allah! Does my 
repentance require that I should give the whole of my property in charity?' He 
replied, `Keep a part of it, for it will be better for you.' Accordingly, I kept 
my property at Khaibar for myself and gave all the rest in charity. Then I 
solemnly pledged that I would stick to the truth throughout the rest of my life, 
for Allah had forgiven me in return for the truth I had told. That is why I have 
never uttered a word against reality intentionally up to this time and hope and 
expect that Allah will protect me from lies in future as well. "<br><br>This 
story contains many lessons, and every Believer should impress these on his mind 
and heart.<br><br>The first and foremost lesson we learn from this story is that 
the matter of the conflict between Islam and kufr is so important and delicate 
that we should take the greatest possible care to be on our guard in regard to 
this. Not to mention the case of one who takes active part on the side of kufr, 
if a Muslim shows the least negligence even inadvertently in taking part on the 
side of Islam once in his life; and that, too, not with any evil intention, he 
is liable to lose all the lifelong services and devotions rendered by him in the 
cause of Islam. That was why such a severe action was taken even against those 
worthy people who had done great deeds of valor in the battles of Badr, Uhd, 
Ahzab and Hunain, and whose sincerity and Faith were absolutely above suspicion.<br>
<br>The second thing, which is as important as the first, is that one should 
never consider lightly any negligence in the performance of a duty, for this 
often misleads one to commit an offense that is counted among heinous sins. The 
fact that ore did not commit the offense with any evil intention cannot save one 
from punishment.<br><br>Lastly, this story presents the true spirit of the 
society that had been evolved out under the leadership of the Holy Prophet. On 
the one side there were the hypocrites whose treacherous deeds were quite well 
known to all. They offered lame excuses which were accepted without demur for 
nothing better could be expected from them. On the other side, let us take the 
case of Ka`ab bin Malik, who was a tried Believer, and whose sacrifices were 
above every kind of suspicion. He did not invent any false story to justify 
himself but confessed his fault quite plainly and clearly. But in contrast to 
the hypocrites, a severe chastisement was inflicted on him, not because there 
was any suspicion about his Faith but because a sincere Believer like him had 
behaved in a way in which only a hypocrite could behave. Thus the chastisement 
was meant to remind them: "You are the salt of the earth. But if you, too, 
become tasteless, from where will then salt be obtained?"<br><br>There is 
another noteworthy side of the matter. The part played by the Leader and the 
Follower and the Muslim Society in this incident is unique. The Leader inflicts 
the most severe punishment but with the feelings of affection and without any 
tinge of anger or hatred in it. It is like the punishment which a father gives 
to his son, It is always understood that the punishment is given for the good of 
the son, who knows that as soon as he mends his ways, he will regain the 
fatherly love. And the Follower sets an excellent example of obedience under 
very trying circumstances. He suffers hard from the severity of the chastisement 
but never thinks of rebelling against the Leader because of any false personal 
or clannish pride; nay, he does not cherish in his heart any complaint against 
his beloved Leader, but begins to love him even more than before. During this 
saddest period of his life the only thing he yearns for is a look of affection 
from his Leader. For he is like a famine-stricken farmer whose only hope is the 
piece of cloud which he sees floating in the sky.<br><br>Now let us have a 
glimpse of the Muslim society, which displayed the greatest discipline and the 
highest moral spirit that had ever been shown by any society. No sooner does the 
Leader order the boycott than the whole community becomes a stranger to the 
follower not only in public but also in private. So much so that his nearest 
relatives and closest friends do not even speak to him; nay, his own wife leaves 
him alone. He implores them on oath to tell him if they suspected his sincerity, 
but even his lifelong companions make a point-blank refusal, saying that he 
should ask Allah and His Messenger for that testimony. But in spite of the show 
of this strict discipline, the moral spirit of the community is so high and so 
pure that not a single person tries to take advantage of the position of the 
fallen brother by adding insult to his injury; nay, every one feels sorry for 
his brother in disgrace, and is important to embrace him as soon as he is 
forgiven. That is why the people run in haste to tell him the good news. to 
build.<br><br>The above is the model of the Righteous community that the Qur'an 
aims<br><br>This background makes it plain why Allah not only forgave them but 
also manifested His Kindness; Gentleness and Compassion in His Forgiveness to 
these people. It was because of their sincerity which they proved during the 
fifty days of their chastisement. Had they shown arrogance after the commission 
of their offense and retaliated by taking angry and hostile actions as does 
every self-worshiper whose pride is wounded: had they behaved during their 
boycott in a manner as if they would break away from the community but never bow 
down before it: had they passed this period in spreading dissatisfaction in the 
community and gathering around them all the disgruntled people in order to 
organize a strong "opposition" against the Leader, then they would have most 
certainly been expelled from the community, as if to say, "Go you now and 
worship the idol of your self, for henceforth you will never be given any 
opportunity for exerting to raise the Word of Allah". But these Three did not 
adopt this way though it was open to them. On the contrary, they took a 
different way, as has been seen, and proved that God-worship had destroyed every 
idol that might have remained hidden in their hearts: that they had dedicated 
themselves entirely to the exertion in the Way of Allah: that while joining the 
Islamic community they had burnt their boats to make it impossible for 
themselves to go back anywhere: that they would put up with every kind of 
treatment but would remain in the community and die as a member of it and would 
scornfully reject any offer of an honorable place outside it; and would rather 
bear disgrace in it. That was why they were again taken in the community with 
the same honor as before. This is the explanation of the kind words of 
forgiveness: "Allah turned to them with kindness so that they should turn to 
Him." In these concise words, the Qur'an has depicted the true picture of the 
matter. The Master had at first turned away His attention from His Three 
servants but when He saw that they had not left His door but had remained there 
with broken hearts, He again turned to them in appreciation of their fidelity so 
as to bring them back into the fold. <br><br>120In order to comprehend the 
meaning of this verse, v. 97 with which it is connected, should be kept in view:<br>
<br>"These Bedouins are most stubborn in unbelief and hypocrisy, and, in all 
probability, will remain ignorant of the laws of the Way which Allah has sent 
down to His Messenger."<br><br>In v. 97, the Qur'an merely diagnosed the disease 
and pointed out its symptoms. The Bedouins were suffering from the disease of 
hypocrisy because of their ignorance of the laws of the Way of Allah. This was 
so because they had not had any connections with the Center of that knowledge. 
Here in this concluding portion of the Surah, the remedy of that disease has 
been prescribed so that they should have an understanding of Islam and its 
implications. It is not necessary that for this purpose all of them should leave 
their homes and come to AI-Madinah to learn that knowledge, but some of them 
should come from each habitation, clan and region to the Centers of the 
Knowledge (AI-Madinah, Makkah and the like) and understand Islam. Then they 
should go back to their own habitations and create its understanding among the 
common people.<br><br>This was a very important instruction that was given at 
the opportune moment to strengthen the Islamic Movement for, at that time, the 
people were entering into the fold of Islam in large numbers without its proper 
understanding. Obviously, this instruction was not needed in the initial stages 
of the Movement, for at that tune everyone who embraced Islam did so with its 
full understanding. No one would think of becoming a Muslim without this as this 
was an invitation to persecution. When the Movement became successful and won 
power in the land, the clans and the habitations began to enter en bloc into the 
fold of Islam. Naturally very few of them understood the full implications of 
the Faith before accepting it, but the majority of them were being carried into 
the fold, as it were, by the strong current that had been generated by the 
Movement. Outwardly this immense increase in numbers appeared to be a source of 
strength to Islam, but in reality such people as had no true understanding of 
Islam and were, therefore, not prepared to fulfill its moral obligations, were 
not only useless for the Islamic System but were actually harmful to it. This 
side of the matter became quite apparent during the preparations for the Tabuk 
expedition. That is why Allah sent down the instruction that necessary steps 
should be taken for the integration of the Islamic Community so that it may keep 
pace with the immense increase in its number. Therefore some people should be 
brought out from every habitation and taught and trained in the requirements of 
Islam and these in their turn should teach and train their own people so that 
the whole Muslim population should understand Islam and obtain the knowledge of 
the limits prescribed by Allah.<br><br>In this connection, it should also be 
clearly understood that the Command about mass education given in this verse is 
not merely about literacy but it had the definite aim of imparting the 
understanding of the Way of Islam among the masses and enabling them to refrain 
from un-Islamic Ways. This is the real and permanent aim of education that has 
been set before the Muslims by Allah Himself. Therefore every system of their 
education shall be judged by this criterion and shall be regarded Islamic only 
to the extent it fulfills this aim. It does not, however, mean that Islam is 
against the spreading of literacy and teaching of the purely mundane subjects to 
the masses, but it simply means that the primary aim of the Islamic Education 
should be the achievement of the objective which has been mentioned above in 
italics. Without this, it does not consider any education to be education at 
all, even if it were to produce Einsteins and Freuds of the age.<br><br>It will 
be worthwhile to consider the true significance of the words used in the 
context, for they created a strange misunderstanding among the people of the 
later period, and produced lasting poisonous effects on the religious education 
of the Muslims, nay, on their whole religious life in general. It is obvious 
that Allah used these words in order to lay down the objective of education 
before the Muslims, which was this: to understand the Islamic Way of life and 
have an insight into its system: to be familiar with its true nature and spirit 
so as to be able to judge and differentiate between the Islamic and the 
un-Islamic ways of thought and conduct in every aspect of life. But later on 
when the knowledge of the Muslim Law was given the technical name of (fiqh), it 
gradually developed into the science of the details of external form (as opposed 
to the spiritual aspect of the Islamic Law). As the word (fiqh) is of the same 
root as used in this verse, a misunderstanding was created that this Command of 
the Qur'an was about acquiring the knowledge of fiqh in the above-mentioned 
sense. It is true that this knowledge is of great importance in the Islamic 
System of life, but it is not all that is required by the Qur'an but only a part 
of the objective. It is not possible to recount here all the damages that the 
Muslim Community has suffered because of this misunderstanding, but suffice it 
to say that this is the thing, which is responsible for reducing the religious 
education of the Muslims to the knowledge and interpretation of the external 
form of Islam without paying any attention to the spirit of Islam. This 
inevitably resulted in making lifeless formalism the ultimate goal of the life 
of the Muslims. <br><br>121From the apparent wording of this verse, it may be 
inferred that only those Muslims have at first been held responsible to fight 
with those enemies of Islam who live near their territory. But if we read this 
verse along with the succeeding passage, it becomes clear that here 
"disbelievers who are near you refers to those hypocrites who were doing great 
harm to to Islamic Society by mixing up with the sincere Muslims. This very 
thing was stated in v. 73 at the beginning of this discourse. The Command has 
been repeated at its end in order to impress on the Muslims the importance of 
the matter and to urge them to do Jihad and crush these internal enemies, 
without paying the Least regard to the racial, family and social relations that 
had been proving a binding force with them. The only difference between the two 
Commands is that in v. 73, the Muslims were asked to do Jihad with them, while 
in this verse stronger words, "fight with them" , have been used, which were 
meant to impress on them that they should crush the hypocrites thoroughly and 
completely. Another difference in the wordings is that in v. 73, two different 
words, "disbelievers and hypocrites", have been used, while in this verse only 
one word, "disbelievers", has been used so that the hypocrites should forfeit 
all their claims as Muslims, for there was room for this concession in the word 
"hypocrite" <br><br>122This is meant to impress that they should not, in future, 
show the lenient treatment they had been meting out to them up to that time. 
This has already been commanded in v. 73: "be firm and stern with them". <br>
<br>123This warning has two-fold meanings and both are implied here. First, "If 
you show any kind of leniency towards them because of your personal or family or 
economic connections with them, you should know that such a thing shall be 
against the fear of God', for the fear of God and friendly relations with the 
enemies of Allah are contradictory things. Therefore, you should give these up, 
if you desire to obtain Allah's help". Secondly, "You should scrupulously 
observe the moral and humane limits in doing Jihad, and in fighting with them. 
For you should always keep yourselves within the prescribed limits in 
everything. If you transgress these in any way, you should know that Allah will 
forsake you for He helps only those who are God fearing. <br><br>124As regards 
the increase and decrease in Faith. disbelief and hypocrisy, please refer to 
E.N.2 of Surah Al-Anfal.<br><br>125That is, during the course of every year such 
circumstances are created as put to test once or twice their claim to the Faith, 
and these disclose that their profession of Islam was like a counterfeit coin. 
For instance, some time their Faith is tested by (a) a Commandment of the Qur'an 
which lays some new restriction on their lust, or by (b) a demand of the Faith 
that hits hard at their self interests, or by (c) an internal dispute which 
discloses their preference for worldly interests and for their personal, family 
and clannish relations to Allah, His Messenger and the Faith, or by (d) a war 
that requires the sacrifice of their lives, wealth, time and energies. All these 
tests help bring to the open that filth of hypocrisy that lay hidden in their 
hearts under the garb of the profession of Islam. Besides, these things increase 
that filth which had already gathered in their hearts because of their 
deviations from the implications of the Faith. <br><br>126This happened when the 
hypocrites had to attend a meeting that was specially hold for the recital of 
some new surah. The Holy Prophet used to recite as an address every new surah 
before the assembly. The true believers would listen to it very attentively and 
respectfully. But the hypocrites, who had to attend the meeting to show that 
they were "Muslims', would sit listlessly in the meeting for they had no 
interest in the recital. But when they would be assured that their "attendance" 
had been marked, they would look for an opportune moment to slip away without 
being seen and noticed.<br><br>127"Allah has turned away their hearts from the 
Qur'an, because they do not understand that it is in their own interest to 
listen to the Qur'an and to act upon its teachings. These foolish people do not 
realize that by ignoring the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet, they in fact, deprive 
themselves of a great blessing. As they are deeply engaged in their own narrow 
interests, they do not see that the great knowledge of the Qur'an and the right 
guidance of the Holy Prophet has the potentiality of making them the leaders of 
this world, and of bringing salvation to them in the Next World. As a result of 
their folly and neglect of the great blessing, Allah has, in accordance with His 
Law, deprived them of the capacity of making use of this blessing and "turned 
away their hearts" from it. That is why these unfortunate, people do not even 
feel the great loss they are suffering, while the blessed people are taking full 
advantage of this great fountainhead of power and strength and are preparing 
themselves for achieving the greatest success that human beings could ever 
achieve.<br></p>
