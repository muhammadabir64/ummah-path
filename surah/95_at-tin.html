                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
                        <p>The Surah has been so named after the very first word at-tin.</p>
                        <p><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>According to Qatadah, this Surah
                          is Madani. Two different views have been reported from Ibn Abbas: first that it
                          is a Makki Surah, and second that it is Madani. But the majority of scholars
                          regard it as a Makki revelation, a manifest symbol of which is the use of the
                          words hadh-al-balad-il-amin (this city of peace) for Makkah. Obviously, if it
                          had been revealed at Madinah, it would not be correct to use the words "this
                          city" for Makkah Besides, a study of the contents of the Surah shows that it
                          belongs to the earliest period of Makkah, for in it there is no sign whatever to
                          indicate that during the period of its revelation any conflict had started
                          between Islam and unbelief. Moreover, it reflects the same style of the earliest
                          revelations of Makkah period in which briefly and succinctly the people have
                          been made to realize that the judgment of the Hereafter is necessary and
                        absolutely rational.</p>
                        <p><strong>Theme and Subject Matter</strong><br><br>Its theme is the rewards and
                          punishments of the Hereafter. For this purpose first swearing an oath by the
                          habitats of some illustrious Prophets, it has been stated that Allah has created
                          man in the most excellent of molds. Although at other places in the Quran, this
                          truth has been expressed in different ways, for example, at some places it has
                          been said: "Allah appointed man His vicegerent on the earth and commanded the
                          angels to bow down to him (Al-Baqarah: 30,34, Al-Anam: 165, Al-Araf: 11, Al-Hijr
                          28,29, An-Naml: 62, Suad 71- 73);" at others that: "Man has become bearer of the
                          Divine trust, which the earth and the heavens and the mountains did not have the
                          power to bear (Al-Ahzab 72);" and at still others that: "We honored the children
                          of Adam and exalted them above many of Our other creatures (Bani Israil 70),"
                          yet here the statement made on oath in particular by the habitats of the
                          Prophets that man has been created in the finest of molds, signifies that
                          mankind has been blessed with such an excellent mold and nature that it gave
                          birth to men capable of attaining to the highest position of Prophethood, a
                          higher position than which has not been attained by any other creature of God.<br>
                          <br>Then, it has been stated that there are two kinds of men. those who in spite
                          of having been created in the finest of molds, become inclined to evil and their
                          moral degeneration causes them to be reduced to the lowest of the low, and those
                          who by adopting the way of faith and righteousness remain secure from the
                          degeneration and consistent with the noble position, which is the necessary
                          demand of their having been created in the best of molds. The existence among
                          mankind of both these kinds of men is such a factual thing which no one can
                          deny, for it is being observed and experienced in society everywhere at all
                          times.<br><br>In conclusion, this factual reality has been used as an argument
                          to prove that when among the people there are these two separate and quite
                          distinct kinds, how can one deny the judgment and retribution for deeds If the
                          morally degraded are not punished and the morally pure and exalted are not
                          rewarded and both end in the dust alike, it would mean that there is no justice
                          in the Kingdom of God; whereas human nature and common sense demand that a judge
                          should do justice. How then can one conceive that Allah, Who is the most just of
                        all judges, would not do justice? <br></p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><br>[1-8] By the fig and the olive,1 and the Mount Sina,2 and this City of
                          peace (Makkah), We have indeed created man in the finest of molds,3 then We
                          reversed him to the lowest of the low,4 except those who believed and did good
                          works. For them there is a reward unending.5 Therefore, (O Prophet,) who can
                          .after this belie you concerning the rewards and punishments?6 Is not Allah the
                          best of all judges?7<br><br>1There has been much difference of opinion among the
                          commentators about the explanation of this verse. Hasan Basri. `Ikrimah, `Ata'
                          bin Abi Rabah, Jabir bin Zaid, Mujahid and Ibrahim Nakha'i (may Allah bless them
                          all) say that the fig implies the same fig which the people eat, and the olive
                          the same which produces oil. Ibn Abi Hatim and Hakim have cited a statement from
                          Ha 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also in support of this. And the commentators who have
                          accepted this explanation have, in view of the uses and virtues of the fig and
                          the olive, expressed the opinion that Allah has sworn by these two fruits
                          because of these very qualities. There is no doubt that the Arabic reader would
                          understand the words do and zayun in the same meaning as are their well known
                          meanings in Arabic, yet there are two reasons for which these meanings cannot be
                          accepted. First, that in the subsequent verses, oaths have been sworn by the
                          Mount Sinai and the City of Makkah, and there seems to be no relevance between
                          the oaths sworn by the two fruits and the oaths by the two places. Second, the
                          theme that follows the oaths is borne out by the Mt. Sinai and the City of
                          Makkah but not by the two fruits. Wherever in the Qur'an Allah has sworn by
                          something, He has not sworn by it because of its glory or its uses and benefits
                          but every oath has relevance to the theme that follows it. Therefore, the
                          virtues and qualities of these two fruits cannot be regarded as the reason for
                          swearing the oath by them.<br><br>Some other commentators have taken tin and
                          zaytun to imply some places. Ka`b Abhar, Qatadah an Ibn Zaid say that tin
                          implies Damascus and zaytun Bait al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). A view of Ibn 'Abbas has
                          been cited by Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Marduyah to the effect that tin
                          implies the mosque of the Prophet Noah, which he built on Mt. Judi, and zaytun
                          implies Bait al-Maqdis, but hearing the words wat-tin waz-zaytin, no ordinary
                          Arab could think of these meanings, nor was it well known among the Arabs, who
                          were the first addressees of the Qur'an that ain and zaytun were names of the
                          places.<br><br>However, there was a practice among the people of Arabia that
                          they generally named a land where a certain fruit was produced in plenty after
                          the name of the fruit itself. Accordingly, the meaning. Of tin and zaytun can be
                          the land where these fruits are grown, and it is the land of Syria and
                          Palestine, for among the Arabs of that period this very land was well known for
                          the production of fig and olive. lbn Taimiyah, Ibn al-Qayyim, zamakhshari and
                          Alusi (may Allah show them mercy) have adopted this very explanation; and
                          although Ibn Jarir also has preferred the first view, yet he has conceded that
                          ain and zaytun may also imply the land where these fruits are grown. Hafiz Ibn
                          Kathir also has regarded this explanation as worthy of consideration. <br><br>
                          2The words in the original are Tur- i-Sinin. Sinin is another name for the Sinai
                          Peninsula. It is called Sama or Sina as well as Sinin. In the Qur'an itself at
                          one place the words Tur-i-Sinin. have been used. Since the land in which Mt.
                          Sinai is located is well known as Sina, we have adopted this well known name in
                          the translation. <br><br>3This is the truth for which the oath has been sworn by
                          the lands of the fig and the olive (i.e. Syria and Palestine) and Mt. Sinai and
                          Makkah, the city of peace. Man's having been created in the most excellent of
                          molds means that he has been given the finest body which no other living being
                          has been given, and he has been blessed with the noblest faculties of thought,
                          knowledge and intellect which no other creature has been blessed with. Then,
                          since the most sublime model these excellencies and . unique merits of mankind's
                          are the Prophets (upon whom be Allah's peace), and no creation can have a higher
                          rank than they, so that Allah may choose it for appointment to the office of
                          Prophethood, an oath has been sworn by the places associated with the Prophets
                          of God to bear testimony to man's having been created in the finest of molds.
                          The land of Syria and Palestine is the land where a large number of Prophets,
                          from the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) to the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon
                          him), were raised. Mt. Tur is the place where the Prophet Moses was blessed with
                          Prophethood. As for Makkah, it was founded by the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael
                          themselves. It was on account of their association with it that ' it became the
                          holiest central place of Arabia. It was the Prophet Abraham who had prayed: "O
                          my Lord, make this city a city of peace and security." (Al-Baqarah: 126); and it
                          was because of this prayer that in the midst of chaos and confusion prevailing
                          everywhere in Arabia only this city continued to remain an island of peace for
                          some 2500 years or more. Thus, the verse means to say: "We created mankind in
                          such an excellent mold that it produced men who attained to the most sublime
                          rank of Prophethood." <br><br>4The commentators in general have given two
                          meanings of this:<br><br>(1) That We reversed him to the miserable state of old
                          age in which he was no longer able to think and understand and work; and<br><br>
                          (2) that We reversed him to the lowest stage of Hell.<br><br>But these two
                          meanings cannot be an argument for the object for the confirmation of which this
                          Surah was revealed. The Surah is meant to reason out the truth of the judgment
                          in the Hereafter. On this, neither has this tact any bearing that some human
                          beings are caused to reach the most miserable state of old age, nor that a
                          section of human beings will be cast into Hell. The first thing cannot be an
                          argument for the judgment because old age comes upon both the good and the bad
                          people, and a person's reaching this age is no punishment which he might suffer
                          in consequence of his deeds. As for the second thing, it will occur in the
                          Hereafter. It cannot be presented as an argument before the people who are being
                          convinced of the meting out of rewards and punishments in the Hereafter itself.
                          Therefore in our opinion the correct meaning of the verse is: After having been
                          created in the finest of molds when man uses the powers of his body and mind in
                          evil ways Allah grants him the power to do only evil and causes him to reach the
                          lowest ebb of degradation. This is a truth which one commonly observes in human
                          society. People become so overwhelmed by greed, selfishness, lustfulness,
                          addiction to intoxicants, meanness, rage and fury and such other traits that
                          morally they are actually reduced to the lowest of the low. Consider only one
                          example: When a nation is blinded by its hostility to another country it
                          surpasses all savage beasts in barbarity. A wild beast preys upon its victim
                          only for the sake of food, it does not resort to a general massacre; but man
                          resorts to massacre of his own kind. The beast only uses its claws and teeth but
                          man who has been created in the best of molds invents the gun, rifle, tank,
                          aircraft, atom and hydrogen bombs and countless other weapons by his intellect
                          so that he can instantly destroy whole populations. The beast only kills or
                          inflicts a wound but man invents such painful methods of torturing men like
                          himself as cannot even be -imagined by a' beast. Then to wreak his vengeance and
                          fury on his enemies he forces the women to march out in naked processions: they
                          are subjected to rape by tens and twenties of men; they are dishonored before
                          the eyes of their fathers, brothers and husbands; children are massacred in
                          front of their parents; mothers are forced to drink their children's blood;
                          human beings are burnt and buried alive. There is no wild species of animals in
                          the world which may equal this human barbarity in any degree. The same is also
                          the case with other evil traits: man proves himself to he the lowest of the low
                          in whichever evil he indulges. So much so that he degrades even religion which
                          is the most sacred thing for man: he worships the trees, animals and mountains,
                          even the sex organs of man and woman; he keeps religious prostitutes in the
                          places of worship to win the goodwill of the gods and commits adultery with them
                          as an act of virtue. In his mythology he attributes such filthy tales to his
                          gods and goddesses which would make the most wretched beast to hang his head in
                          shame. <br><br>5The commentators who have taken asfala safilin to imply the
                          state of extreme old age when man loses his sense and reason, interpret this
                          verse to mean: "But the people who in the prime and strength of their age
                          believed and did righteous deeds would have in this old age too the same
                          righteous deeds credited for them and will be rewarded accordingly. No reduction
                          will be made in their rewards on the ground that they could not perform those
                          righteous deeds in that period of Iife". And the commentators who construe
                          reversal to safilin to imply being cast into the lowest stage of Hell interpret
                          this verse to mean: "the people also believed and did righteous deeds are an
                          exception: they will not be reversed to this stage but they will have a reward
                          unending and unfailing." But, neither of these meanings is relevant to the
                          reasoning made in this Surah to justify the judgment of the Hereafter. In our
                          opinion the verse means: "Just as it is a common observation in human society
                          that the morally degraded are made the lowest of the low, so this also is an
                          observation of every age that those who believed in God, the Hereafter and the
                          Prophethood and who molded their lives after righteousness and piety, remained
                          secure from this degeneration and remained consistent with the best mold and
                          nature that Allah had created them on. Therefore, they are worthy of the
                          unending reward, i.e. the reward which will neither be less than what they
                          deserve, nor will it ever be cut off. " <br><br>6Another translation of this
                          verse can be: "What can after this (O man ) make you deny the judgment ?" In
                          both cases the intention and purpose remains the same. That is when it is a
                          common observation in human society that a section of mankind which has been
                          created in the best of molds and nature, is rendered lowest of the low because
                          of moral degradation, and the other section remains secure by adopting the path
                          of constant faith and righteousness in view of its being created in the best of
                          molds and nature how can judgment be denied after this ? Does common sense
                          require that the end of both these men be the same? Does justice demand that
                          neither those who are reduced to the lowest of the low be punished nor those who
                          strive to adopt a righteous life be rewarded ? The same theme has been expressed
                          at other places in the Qur'an thus: "Shall We then treat the obedient as We
                          treat the culprits? What has happened to you: how ill you judge?" (AI-Qalam: 35,
                          36). "Do those who have committed evil think that We shall hold them and those
                          who have believed and done righteous deeds as equal so that their life and their
                          death should be alike ? Ill are the judgments they pass!" (Al-Jathiyah 21). <br>
                          <br>7That is, "When you want and expect even the petty judges of the world to do
                          justice, punish the culprits and reward the doers of good, what is your opinion
                          about God? Is He not the greatest of all judges? If you think he is the .
                          greatest of all judges, do you think that He will not do any justice? Do you
                          expect that He will treat the good and the evil alike? Will those who commit the
                          vilest of deeds in the world and those who perform righteous deeds, both end in
                          the dust: neither will any be punished for his evil deeds, nor any be rewarded
                          for his good works''<br><br>Imam Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, Ibn al-Mundhir,
                          Baihaqi, Hakim and Ibn Marduyah have related, on the authority of Hadrat Abu
                          Hurairah, that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: "When one of you
                          recites Surah Wat-tin waz-zaytun and reaches Alais-Allah-u bi-ahkam-il-Hakimin
                          he should respond to it, saying: Bata wa ana ala dhalika min-ash-shahidin (Yes,
                          and I am of those who bear witness to it). According to some other traditions,
                          the Holy Prophet responded with Subhanaka fa-bald when he recited this verse.<br>
