<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>The name of this Surah has not been taken from 
any verse but it has been called Al-Anbiyaa because it contains a continuous 
account of many Anbiyaa (Prophets). Nevertheless, it is a symbolic name and not 
a title.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>Both the subject 
matter and the style of the Surah indicate that it was sent down in the third 
stage of the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah.(Sea Introduction to Chapter 
VI).<br><br><strong>Subject and Topics</strong><br><br>This Surah discusses the 
conflict between the Holy Prophet and the chiefs of Makkah, which was rampant at 
the time of its Revelation and answers those objections and doubts which were 
being put forward concerning his Prophethood and the Doctrines of Tauhid and the 
Hereafter. The chiefs of Makkah have also been rebuked for their machinations 
against the Holy Prophet and warned of the evil consequences of their wicked 
activities. They have been admonished to give up their indifference and 
heedlessness that they were showing about the Message. At the end of the Surah, 
they have been told that the person whom they considered to be a "distress and 
affliction" had in reality come to them as a blessing.<br><br><strong>Main Theme</strong>s<br>
<br>In vv. 1-47, the following themes have been discussed in particular :<br>
<br>The objection of the disbelievers that a human being could not be a 
Messenger and therefore they could not accept Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a 
Prophet, has been refuted.<br><br>They have been taken to task for raising 
multifarious and contradictory objections against the Holy Prophet and the 
Qur'an.<br><br>Their wrong conception of life has been proved to be false 
because it was responsible for their indifferent and heedless attitude towards 
the Message of the Holy Prophet. They believed that life was merely a sport and 
pastime and had no purpose behind or before it and there was no accountability 
or reward or punishment.<br><br>The main cause of the conflict between the 
disbelievers and the Holy Prophet was their insistence on the doctrine of shirk 
and antagonism to the Doctrine of Tauhid. So the doctrine of skirk has been 
refuted and the Doctrine of Tauhid reinforced by weighty and impressive though 
brief arguments.<br><br>Arguments and admonitions have been used to remove 
another misunderstanding of theirs. They presumed that Muhammad (peace be upon 
him) was a false prophet and his warnings of a scourge from God were empty 
threats, just because no scourge was visiting them in spite of their persistent 
rejection of the Prophet.<br><br>In vv. 48-91, instances have been cited from 
the important events of the life stories of the Prophets to show that all the 
Prophets, who were sent by God, were human beings and had all the 
characteristics of a man except those which were exclusive to Prophethood. They 
had no share in Godhead and they had to implore Allah to fulfill each and every 
necessity of theirs.<br><br>Along with these two other things have also been 
mentioned:<br><br>All the Prophets had to pass through distress and affliction; 
their opponents did their worst to thwart their mission, but in spite of it they 
came out successful by the extraordinary succor from Allah.<br><br>All the 
Prophets had one and the same "way of life', the same as was being presented by 
Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), and that was the only Right Way of Life 
and all other ways invented and introduced by mischievous people were utterly 
wrong.<br><br>In vv. 92-106, it has been declared that only those who follow the 
Right Way, will come out successful in the final judgment of God and those who 
discard it shall meet with the worst consequences.<br><br>In vv. 107-112, the 
people have been told that it is a great favor of Allah that He has sent His 
Messenger to inform them beforehand of this Reality and that those, who consider 
his coming to be an affliction instead of a blessing, are foolish people.</p>

<p>1"The time....near": the time of Resurrection. This is to warn the people 
that the time of Resurrection when they will have to appear before their Lord to 
render their accounts is not far. This was because the coming of the Holy 
Prophet was a sign and a clear evidence of the fact that mankind had entered the 
last stage of its history. The Holy Prophet himself explained it by holding out 
two of his adjoining fingers and said, "I have been sent at a time which joins 
to the time of Resurrection just as these two fingers adjoin" . By this he meant 
to say, "No other Prophet is coming between me and the Resurrection. Therefore 
mend your ways now, for after me no guide is coming with good news and warning."<br>
<br>2That is, "They do not pay heed to any warning nor reflect on their end nor 
listen to the admonition of the Messenger." <br><br>3"New Revelation": A new 
Surah of the Qur'an.<br><br>4The words of the original Text may also be 
interpreted as: "They do not take life seriously but treat it as a sport and a 
joke".<br><br>5This may also be translated as: "What, are you then being 
ensnared by his magic?"<br><br>The disbelievers, who were the chiefs of Makkah, 
whispered to one another to this effect: "Anyhow this man cannot be a Prophet 
because he is a human being like us and eats and drinks and has wife and 
children like us. We see nothing unusual about him that might distinguish him 
from us and make him worthy of the office of Prophethood. We, however, admit 
that there is some magic in his talk and personality. That is why any one who 
listens to him or goes near Him is charmed. Therefore, the best thing for you is 
not to listen to him at all, nor go near him, for listening to him or going near 
him will only be involving yourselves intentionally in his snare."<br><br>The 
reason why they accused the Holy Prophet of practicing magic was that even his 
antagonists were "charmed" by his personality. when they met him. Muhammad bin 
Ishaq (d. 152 A.H.) says, "Once `Utbah bin Rabi`ah, the father-in-law of Abu 
Sufyan, said to the chiefs that he wanted to see Muhammad and give him counsel. 
They said, `We have full confidence in you; you may go and have a talk with 
him.' Accordingly, he went to the Holy Prophet and said, `Dear nephew, you know 
that you were held in great honor here before this and you belong to a noble 
family. Why have you then brought this affliction to your people? You have 
caused discard among them: you consider your people to be fools: you speak ill 
of their religion and deities, and you declare their deceased forefathers to be 
disbelievers. My dear nephew, if your object is to become a rich man, we can 
give you so much wealth that you will become the richest man among us: if you 
are seeking a high rank, we will make you our chief, even our king, if you so 
like. But if you are suffering from a mental illness which makes you see 
illusions, we will have you treated by the best physicians.' He went on talking 
in this strain and the Holy Prophet remained silent. When he had a long talk, 
the Holy Prophet said, `Abul Walid, have you had your say or do you want to say 
anything more?' He replied that he had said what he had to say. Then the Holy 
Prophet said, `Now listen to me'. And he began to recite Surah Ha Mim Sajdah 
(Chapter XLI) after Bismillah and Utbah listened to him as if he had been 
charmed. When the Holy Prophet came to v. 38, he fell down in prostration. Then 
raising his head, he said, 'O Abul Walid, I have said whatever I had to say, and 
you have heard it. Now I have nothing more to say'. After this `Utbah walked 
back towards the chiefs who perceived him to be a changed man, and remarked, `By 
God ! his face shows that he is not the same man that he was when he went from 
here.' When he came to them, they asked, `What has been the result of your 
mission'? He answered, `By God, today I have heard a thing the like of which I 
had never heard before. By Allah! It is not poetry nor sorcery nor divination. O 
people of Quraish, I advise you to leave him to himself. From what I have heard 
from him, I conclude that his Message is going to bring about a great revolution 
here. If the Arabs overcome him, you will stand absolved from the charge of 
murdering your own brother, and if he over-powers the Arabs, his sovereignty 
will be your own sovereignty and his honor your own honor.' The people answered, 
`By God! you, too, O Abul Walid, have been charmed by him'. To this he replied, 
`I have expressed my opinion. Now it is for you to accept or reject it'." (Ibn 
Hisham, Vol. I, pp. 313-314). Baihaqi, in his narration of the above event, 
makes this addition: "When the Holy Prophet recited v. 13: `If they turn away 
from your Message, say to them, I have warned you of the coming of a thunderbolt 
like the thunderbolt that visited the `Ad and the Thamud', `Utbah placed his 
hand on the mouth of the Holy Prophet, saying, `For God's sake, have mercy on 
your own people'."<br><br>In this connection, ibn Ishaq has cited another event. 
Once a man from the clan of Arash came to Makkah with some camels and Abu Jahl 
bought them. When he demanded their price, he put him off by lame excuses. At 
last the man came to the Sanctuary of the Ka`bah and began to bewail publicly 
the dishonesty of Abu Jahl. The Holy Prophet was also sitting in a corner of the 
Sanctuary. The chiefs of the Quraish said to the man, "We cannot help you in any 
way in this matter; look, there is a man sitting: go to him and he will get you 
your money." Accordingly the Arashi went towards the Holy Prophet and the chiefs 
began to whisper jokingly, "Today there will be great fun!" When the man 
expressed his complaint before the Holy Prophet, he at once stood up and 
accompanied him to the house of Abu Jahl, followed by an informer of the chiefs. 
The Holy Prophet knocked at Abu Jahl's door, who asked from inside, "Who is 
there"? He answered, "Muhammad". Hearing this, he at once came out and the Holy 
Prophet said to him, "Pay this man his dues." Accordingly, Abu Jahl went in 
without uttering a word, brought the price of the camels and paid the man. At 
this the informer ran back to the Quraish and told them the whole story and 
said, "By God, today I have seen something which I had never seen before. When 
Abu Jahl came out, Muhammad asked him to pay the dues, and he obeyed him as if 
he were spell bound." (Ibn Hisham, Vol. II, pp. 29-30).<br><br>It was this 
"charm" of the personality, character and words of the Holy Prophet which these 
people considered to be the effects of "charm" and warned the people not to go 
near him for fear of his "magic."<br><br>6This was the answer of the Prophet to 
their false propaganda and whispering campaign. Instead of giving a `tit for 
tat' answer, he said, "My Lord will deal with you for He hears everything and 
knows everything."<br><br>7The background of this verse is this: "When the 
message of the Holy Prophet started gaining adherents, the chiefs of Makkah 
decided among themselves to start a propaganda campaign to counteract it. For 
this purpose they decided that every visitor to Makkah for pilgrimage should be 
approached and his mind so poisoned against the Holy Prophet that he dces not 
even go near and listen to him. Though this campaign continued throughout the 
year, in the pilgrimage season specially a large number of men were deputed to 
go to the tents of the pilgrims to warn them to beware of the Holy Prophet. 
Different sorts of things were said against the Holy Prophet during these talks. 
Sometimes it was said that he was a sorcerer, or that he had fabricated the 
Qur'an himself but attributed it to Allah. Some would say that his `Revelations' 
were the words of an insane person and a bundle of incoherent ideas. Others 
would say that these were ordinary poetic ideas which were being dubbed as the 
words of Allah. All they wanted to do was to poison the minds of the visitors 
irrespective of the correctness of their own versions. They had no considered 
and definite opinion in the matter.<br><br>This false propaganda, however, had 
just the opposite effect. The name of the Holy Prophet became known throughout 
the length and breadth of the country through the nefarious activities of the 
chiefs of Makkah. A positive kind of approach from the Muslims would not have 
achieved the same publicity in years as was achieved so rapidly through this 
negative campaign of the Quraish. It set everybody thinking: "After all, who is 
this man against whom such a campaign of vilification has been started?" The 
serious type among them rather came to the conclusion that they must hear the 
Holy Prophet himself and said to themselves: "After all we are not children who 
can be easily enticed away".<br><br>For instance, Ibn Ishaq has related in 
detail the story of Tufail-bin-'Amr Dausi in his own words: "I was a poet of the 
clan of Daus. Once I went to Makkah and was, on my arrival there, surrounded by 
some people of the Quraish who told me all sorts of things against the Holy 
Prophet. So I grew suspicious and tried to avoid him as far as possible. The 
very next day, when I went to visit the Sanctuary, I saw him saying his prayer. 
By chance, I heard a few sentences and felt that what he was reciting were 
excellent words. I said to myself, `I am a poet and a sensible young man and no 
child who cannot discriminate between the right and the wrong. Why should I not 
therefore meet him and inquire what he is reciting?' Accordingly, 1 followed him 
to his house and said, `The people had so mch poisoned me against you that I had 
actually put cotton into my ears lest I should hear. your voice, but what I have 
heard today from you by chance was so appealing that I feel urged to inquire 
into your Message rather in detail. At this the Holy Prophet recited a passage 
of the Qur'an, as a result of which I embraced Islam there and then. On my 
return home I induced my father and wife to become Muslims, which they did, and 
then invited the people of my clan to embrace Islam with the result that till 
the Battle of the Trench as many as eighty families from my clan had entered the 
fold of Islam." (Ibn Hisham, Vol. II, pp. 22-24).<br><br>According to another 
tradition cited by Ibn Ishaq, the chiefs of the Quraish confessed in their 
private meetings that all their charges against the Holy Prophet were false. 
According to him, addressing a meeting, Nadr bin Harith once said, "You cannot 
overcome Muhammad by the methods you are adopting against him. When he was a 
young man you regarded him as your best-mannered person and looked upon him as 
your most truthful and honest man. Now that he has attained advanced age, you 
say, He is a sorcerer: he is a sooth-sayer: he is a poet: he is insane.' By God, 
he is not a sorcerer, for we very well know what kind of people the sorcerers 
are and what kind of tricks they resort to. By God, he is not a soothsayer, for 
we are fully aware of the guess-works of the sooth-sayers. By God, he is not a 
poet for we know what poetry is and can judge that his words cannot be 
classified under poetry in any sense. By God, he is not insane, for we all know 
what nonsensical things the insane people utter. Therefore, O chiefs of the 
Quraish, let us think of some other plan to defeat him". After this, he himself 
proposed that stories from Persia like dose of Rustam and Asfandyar should be 
given publicity to divert the people's attention from the Qur'an. Accordingly, 
they put this scheme into practice and Nadr himself began to relate such stories 
before the people. (Ibn Hisham, Vol. l, pp. 320-321).<br><br>8This contains a 
concise answer to the demand for a sign to the effect<br><br>(1) You ask for 
Signs like the ones which were shown by the former Messengers but you forget 
that those obdurate people did not believe in spite of the Signs shown to them.<br>
<br>(2) While demanding a Sign, you fail to realize that the people, who 
disbelieved even after seeing a Sign, were inevitably destroyed.<br><br>(3) It 
is indeed a favor of Allah that He is not showing the Sign as demanded by you. 
Therefore, the best course for you would be to believe without seeing a Sign. 
Otherwise, you will meet the same doom that the former communities met, when 
they did not believe even after seeing the Signs.<br><br>9This is the answer to 
their objection: "This man is no more than a human being like yourselves", and 
therefore, cannot be a Messenger of God. They have been told that the former 
Prophets, too, whom you also recognize as Prophets, were human beings and were 
blessed with Revelations from Allah.<br><br>10That is, "You may have it 
testified by the Jews, who are the enemies of Islam like you, and are teaching 
you the ways to oppose it, that all the Messengers including Prophet Moses were 
human beings."<br><br>11History not only tells us that the former Messengers 
were human beings but it also contains a lesson that they all received Allah's 
succor as promised by Him and their enemies were completely destroyed. Therefore 
you should seriously consider the goal for which you are heading.<br><br>12This 
is a comprehensive answer to the various objections which were being raised in 
desperation by the disbelievers of Makkah against the Qur'an and the Holy 
Prophet, as if to say:"What is there in this Book that you cannot understand? 
Why don't you consider it in the right spirit? There is nothing contradictory in 
it: it discusses you and your own problems and affairs of life; it describes 
your own nature, origin and end; it discriminates between good and evil and 
presents high moral qualities which your own consciences endorse and confirm. 
Why don't you, then, use your minds to understand this simple and easy thing?"<br>
<br>13That is, “When they realized that Allah's scourge was actually coming”<br>
<br>14This is a very meaningful sentence. It may mean:<br><br>(1) "Examine this 
scourge minutely so that if someone asks you about it, you may be able to give 
an accurate account of it."<br><br>(2) "Hold your grand meetings as usual: 
perhaps your servants may come with folded hands before you to receive orders."<br>
<br>(3) "Hold your councils as before, perhaps people may still come to ask for 
your wise counsels."<br><br>15This was to refute their entire conception of life 
which was based on the assumption that man was free to do whatever he liked, and 
there was none to call him to account or take him to task: that there was no 
life in the Hereafter where one's good deeds would be rewarded and evil deeds 
punished. In other words, this meant that the whole universe had been created 
without any serious purpose and therefore there was no need to pay any heed to 
the Message of the Prophet.<br><br>16That is, "This world has been created with 
a definite purpose and not as a plaything; for, if he had wanted to enjoy a 
sport, We would have done so without creating a sentient, rational and 
responsible creature like you. Far be it from Us to put man to trial and 
conflict for the sake of mere fun."<br><br>17That is, "The object for which this 
world has been created is to stage a conflict between the Truth and falsehood. 
And you yourselves know that in this conflict falsehood has always been defeated 
and destroyed: You should, therefore, consider this reality seriously, for, if 
you build the system of your life on the false presumption that it is mere fun, 
you will meet with the same consequences as the former people did, who presumed 
that the world was a mere show and pastime. Therefore you should reconsider your 
whole attitude towards the Message which has come to you. Instead of making fun 
of it and scoffing at the Messenger, you should take a warning from the fate of 
the former peoples."<br><br>18From here begins the discourse on the confirmation 
of Tauhid and the refutation of shirk for these were the actual bases of the 
conflict between the Holy Prophet and the disbelievers of Makkah. The line of 
argument is this: The whole system of the universe is a clear proof that there 
is One Allah Who is its Creator, Sovereign, Ruler, and Lord and it is a 
falsehood that there are many gods who are partners in His Kingdom and 
Sovereignty, or that there is a Supreme God Who has under Him some minor gods to 
conduct the affairs of His Kingdom. This proof is also based on the preceding 
verses in which it has been stated that the universe has not been created as a 
pastime or a plaything, but for a serious purpose and that there has always been 
a conflict between the Truth and falsehood, and falsehood has always been 
defeated and destroyed. <br><br>19That is, the angels whom the mushriks of 
Arabia believed to be the children of God and worshiped them as partners in 
Godhead.<br><br>20That is, "They are engaged in His service day and night 
without grumbling or ever feeling wearied."<br><br>21This question has been 
posed to bring home to the disbelievers that when they themselves believed that 
there is no being other than Allah who can give life to inanimate matter, why do 
they then acknowledge other deities besides Allah?<br><br>22This concise 
sentence contains two arguments:<br><br>(1) The obviously simple argument is 
that no institution, no household, not to speak of the vast universe containing 
multitudes of countless distant stars, can function smoothly and properly, if it 
has two masters.<br><br>(2) The deeper argument is that the system of the whole 
universe, including that of the earth, is functioning according to a universal 
law. It could not work so even for a moment, if there had been no proper 
proportion, balance, harmony and coordination between the different powers and 
countless things. This is a clear proof that there is a universal and 
all-powerful law and system which binds and forces these powers and things to 
co-operate and coordinate between themselves with a perfect proportion and 
harmony and this could not have happened if there had been different independent 
rulers. The existence of such a system is itself a clear proof that there must 
be One All-Powerful Manager and Administrator governing and ruling the whole 
universe. For further details, please see E. N. 47 of Bani Isra'il (XVII).<br>
<br>23That is, "The Sovereign of the whole universe."<br><br>24The first two 
were rational arguments and this is a historical one. This means that the study 
of all the former Scriptures shows that the Creator of the universe is One Allah 
and He alone is worthy of service and worship, while "Your religion is neither 
supported by rational arguments nor by historical evidence."<br><br>25It is 
their lack of the knowledge of the Reality which has created this indifference 
towards the Message of the Prophet, and the same has made them heedless of the 
Message.<br><br>26"Offspring" here refers to the angels as is clear from v. 28. 
The disbelievers of Arabia believed that the angels were the daughters of God.<br>
<br>27These two verses refute the two reasons for which the mushriks had made 
the angels their deities:<br><br>(1) They took them for the offspring of Allah.<br>
<br>(2) They thought that if they worshiped the angels, they would be so pleased 
that they would intercede with Allah on their behalf. (See X:18; XXXIX:3).<br>
<br>In this connection, it should also be noted that the Qur'an refutes the 
doctrine of intercession of the mushriks, saying, that their so-called 
intercessors are not qualified to intercede for anyone. This is so' because they 
have no knowledge of the hidden things, whereas Allah knows all that is hidden 
from or open to them. Therefore, the angels or Prophets or saints shall be 
allowed intercession only with the prior permission of Allah. As Allah alone has 
the power to hear or accept intercession, none else is entitled to divine 
worship or rights. For further details, please sec Ta Ha (XX): E. N.'s 85-86.<br>
<br>28From the wording of the Text, it appears that at first the whole universe 
was a single mass of matter; then it was split into different parts and the 
earth and the other heavenly bodies were formed. For fuller details, please see 
Ha Mim (XLI):E.N.'s 13-15<br><br>29From the wording of the Text, it appears that 
Allah made water the cause and origin of life. See also An-Nur (XXIV): 45.<br>
<br>30For explanation, see E. N. 12 of An-Nahl (XVI).<br><br>31"Open paths" are 
the passes between high mountains and the valleys and ravines made by the rivers 
in the mountainous regions and other natural ways that connect different regions 
on the earth.<br><br>32This is a very meaningful sentence. It may mean that the 
people may find paths for traveling on the earth, and it may also mean that the 
wisdom that underlies the skill and the system of their creation may guide them 
to the Reality.<br><br>33For explanation, see Al-Hijr (XV): E. N's 8 and 10-12.<br>
<br>34That is, "Those signs which are in the sky"<br><br>35The use of the words 
kullun (all) and yasbahun (float) in the plural (for more than two) indicates 
that not only the sun and the moon but all the heavenly bodies are floating in 
their own separate orbits and none of them is fixed or stationary. These verses 
(30-33) are capable of being interpreted in the modern scientific terms in 
accordance with the present day conceptions of Physics, Biology and Astronomy.<br>
<br>Here it should also be noted that vv. 19-23 refute shirk while vv. 30-33 
present positive proofs of Tauhid. They imply that the creation and regular 
functioning of the universe clearly show that it is the work of One All-Powerful 
Creator, and no sensible person can say that it has been created as a there 
pastime for the sake of fun. When the fact is this and you see proofs of the 
Doctrine of Tauhid all around yourself, in the earth and heavens, why do you 
reject the Message of the Prophet and demand other Signs from him?”<br><br>
36From here the same theme of the conflict between the Holy Prophet and the 
disbelievers, that was interrupted by vv. 19-33, has been resumed.<br><br>37This 
is a brief answer to all those warnings and curses with which the Holy Prophet 
was being threatened and the conspiracies which the Quraish were hatching 
against him day and night. On the one hand, the women of the Quraish cursed him 
because according to them he had ruined their home life by enticing away their 
kith and kits; while on the other, the chiefs of the Quraish threatened hits 
with horrible consequences for the propagation of Islam. After the emigration to 
Habash especially, which almost affected every home of Makkah, these curses and 
threats increased all the more. This verse is meant to comfort and console the 
Holy Prophet as well so that he should continue his mission without any fear of 
their threats.<br><br>38That is, Allah is always putting human beings to test 
and trial both through adversity and affluence. This is to judge whether 
prosperity makes them proud, cruel and slaves of their lusts or they become 
grateful to Allah. On the other hand, He inflicts adversity upon them in order 
to see whether they remain within the prescribed and lawful limits or become 
low-spirited and down-hearted. A sensible person therefore should not be deluded 
by prosperity and adversity, but should keep their trial element in view and try 
to pass through it gracefully.<br><br>39It should be noted that this sentence 
contains only the reason why they scoffed at him, but does not refer to the 
expression of "scoff" itself. Obviously, the disbelievers must have been using 
some other words or expressions of derision to avenge themselves on the Holy 
Prophet for his rejecting their self-made deities.<br><br>40This is to rebuke 
the disbelieves, as if to say, "You cherish so much love of your self-made idols 
and false gods that you cannot tolerate anything against them; so much so that 
you scoff at the Messenger of Allah, but, as for you, you are not ashamed that 
you are stung to the quick when you hear the name of the Merciful and discard 
His mention with disdain."<br><br>41This is not the literal translation of the 
Text; its purport according to the Arabic usage is: "Man is a hasty and 
impatient creature by his very nature." The same thing has been stated in 
XVII:11: "Man is very hasty and impatient."<br><br>42From the succeeding 
sentences it is obvious that "Signs" here stands for the things that have been 
mentioned therein-the "threat" of the scourge of Allah, Resurrection and Hell. 
They made fun of these, as if to say: "This man threatens us with the scourge of 
Allah and the torment of the Day of Resurrection if we deny him and that we 
shall become fuel of Hell; but nothing of the sort has befallen us. We are as 
strong as ever and nothing seems to be happening".<br><br>43That is to say, "Who 
is there to protect and save you from the scourge of Allah if you are suddenly 
visited by it any time during the night or day?"<br><br>44In other words it 
means: "These people have been deluded by Our favor and Our provisions. They 
think they are enjoying prosperity and good life as their personal right and 
there is none to take it away from them. They have forgotten that there is God 
above them Who is able to make or mar their fortune".<br><br>45In this 
connection, see Ar-Ra`d (XIII): 41 and E. N. 60 thereof. Here it bears an 
additional meaning also: "Do they not see that an All-Powerful Being is showing 
His Signs every now and then everywhere on the earth in the form of famines, 
epidemics, floods, earthquakes and other calamities; millions of people are 
killed, habitations and harvests are destroyed and other damages are caused, 
which frustrate all human designs?"<br><br>46It means: "When they know that all 
the resources and provisions of life are in Our hands and that We can increase 
or decrease them as We will, have they the power and strength to defend 
themselves against Our punishment? Can they not see from these "Signs" that 
their power, prosperity and luxury are not everlasting and that there is an 
All-Powerful Allah to seize and punish them?"<br><br>47That is, "The same 
scourge which they are demanding to be hastened and of which they are making 
fun."<br><br>48See also vv. 8-9 and E.N.'s 8-9 of Al-A'araf (Vll). It is 
difficult for us to understand the exact nature of the "Balance". Anyhow it is 
clear that the "Balance" will weigh accurately all the human moral deeds instead 
of material things, and will help judge whether a man is virtuous or wicked and 
how much. The Qur'an has used this word to make mankind understand that every 
deed, good or bad, will be weighed and judged according to merit.<br><br>49From 
here begin the stories of the Prophets. If we consider these stories in the 
context in which they occur, it becomes plain that these have been related to 
impress the following themes:<br><br>(1) All the former Prophets were human 
beings: therefore there is nothing strange or unusual that a human being like 
Muhammad has been sent as a Messenger (Allah's peace be upon him).<br><br>(2) 
The Mission and teachings of this Prophet are the same as of those who were sent 
before him.<br><br>(3) All the Prophets had been granted a privileged position 
by Allah, Who blessed them with special favors. For instance, though they were 
made to suffer from hardships and persecutions for years, ultimately Allah heard 
their prayers and helped them in miraculous ways against their enemies and 
persecutors.<br><br>(4) In spite of Allah's special favors on them they were no 
more than His humble servants and human beings and had no share whatever in 
Godhead; so much so that sometimes they committed errors of judgment, fell ill, 
were put to trials and even committed faults, for which they were called to 
account by Allah.<br><br>50All the three words have been used in praise of the 
Torah: (1) A Criterion which distinguished the Truth from falsehood. (2) A Light 
which showed the Right Way of life, and (3) An Admonition, which reminded the 
erring descendants of Adam to remember the lesson they had forgotten.<br><br>
51Though it was sent for the good of all human beings, only the pious people, 
having these characteristics, could benefit from it.<br><br>52The Hour of 
"Resurrection".<br><br>53The Arabic word (rushd) is very comprehensive and means 
righteousness as well.<br><br>"We had blessed Abraham with discretion;" "The 
discretion he showed in discriminating between the right and the wrong etc. was 
not of his own acquirement but had been bestowed on him by Us." AI-Anbiyaa'<br>
<br>"We knew him well": "We knew that he was worthy of Prophethood; therefore We 
appointed him as such". According to VI:124: " .... Allah knows best whom to 
entrust with His Mission ...."It contains a subtle answer to the objection 
raised by the chiefs of the Quraish: "Why has Allah appointed this man (the Holy 
Prophet) to the office of Prophethood, when he is in no way superior to us?" 
This objection has been answered, as if to say, "The same objection might even 
have been raised against Prophet Abraham by his people, but We knew his 
capabilities. Therefore We selected him for Prophethood."<br><br>In this 
connection, please also see II: 124141, 258-260; VI: 74-84; IX: 114; XI: 69-76; 
XIV: 35-41; XV: 51-58 and XVI: 120-122 and the E.N's thereof.<br><br>54Before 
proceeding further it should be kept in mind that the incident from the history 
of Prophet Abraham has been cited here to refute the erroneous creeds of the 
Quraish. This was meant to hit them hard for they were the descendants of 
Prophet Abraham and were proud of their relationship with him. It was he who had 
built the Ka`abah which had become the center of the whole of Arabia and they, 
being its keepers, were its most important clan. Therefore, they could not 
remain indifferent to this answer.<br><br>55The literal translation will be: 
"Are you presenting the Truth before us, or just playing with us?" They were so 
sure of the truth of their creed that they could never imagine that anyone could 
be serious in declaring it to be false.<br><br>56That is, "If you do not 
understand this by argument, I will present a practical proof that these idols 
are helpless and have no powers. Therefore, it is wrong to make them your 
deities."<br><br>57This was that practical proof. In the absence of the priests 
and attendants, Prophet Abraham entered their central Temple and broke all the 
idols to pieces.<br><br>58The pronoun in the original Text may be translated 
into "it" or "him". In the former case, it will refer to the chief idol and in 
the latter to Prophet Abraham. In the first case, it will imply a subtle sarcasm 
in order to make them realize that their creed of idol-worship was foolish, for 
obviously the chief idol could not break the minor idols. In the second case, it 
will refer to Prophet Abraham, who thought that they might turn to him about the 
"incident" and he might get an opportunity to have a frank talk with them about 
their absurd creed.<br><br>59This was exactly what Prophet Abraham expected to 
happen. He wished that the matter should not remain confined to the priests and 
the attendants but the common people also should be present there to witness 
that their deities were helpless and their priests were deluding them about 
their powers. The priests committed the same folly as was later committed by 
Pharaoh when he arranged an encounter between Prophet Moses and the magicians in 
the open in front of the multitudes of the common people, and the former got an 
opportunity to show publicly the miracle of the staff which shattered the 
illusory, magical tricks of the magicians.<br><br>60The very sentence, "You may 
ask them, if they can speak", is a clear proof that it was not a lie when 
Prophet Abraham said, "All this has been done by their chief." What he intended 
by this was to make them realize and confess that their idols were helpless 
because they could do nothing to protect themselves, and could not even speak. 
It is clear that when a person poses an unreal question for the sake of argument 
in order to bring home the fact that the position taken by the other party is 
untenable, it cannot be considered as a lie; firstly, because the speaker 
himself never intended it to be a lie, and secondly, because the addressees also 
knew that it was not a lie.<br><br>The foregoing remarks have been necessitated 
because of a "tradition" that Prophet Abraham told three "lies" in his life, of 
which one is the above mentioned event. The second "lie" is contained in XXXVII: 
89: "I am indisposed", and the third "lie" is not contained in the Qur'an but in 
the Bible that he declared his wife to be his sister. (Gen. 12:12,13, 18;19). It 
is a pity that this "tradition" has given rise to two divergent opinions. The 
orthodox traditionalists actually believe that Prophet Abraham told these lies 
just because an "authentic tradition" says so. They do not consider that it is 
far better to discard the "tradition" according to which a Prophet is accused of 
being a "liar". On the other hand, those who are against the Traditions, discard 
all of them just because this solitary tradition, which has been reported as 
authentic by Bukhari and Muslim, is unreliable on the very face of it. Obviously 
it needs no elaborate arguments to prove that all the traditions cannot be 
discarded just because one or a few of them are unreliable. As regards the 
upholders of the first opinion, they have gone to the other extreme and think 
that a tradition can be discarded in spite of the authenticity of its reporters 
for cogent reasons. They do this without reference to the contents of the 
tradition itself. But if the text of the tradition itself clearly shows that 
such a thing could not have been said by the Holy Prophet, there is no reason to 
insist that it should be accepted as authentic merely because its reporters are 
authentic.<br><br>This, tradition is unreliable for other reasons also. As has 
already been shown, the first "lie" is no lie at all. As regards the second 
"lie", ("I am indisposed"); it cannot be considered as a lie unless it is proved 
beyond doubt that Prophet Abraham was perfectly healthy at that time, and the 
text does not testify this. As regards the third "lie", the event stated in the 
Bible in chapter 12 of Genesis is absurd on the face of it. When Prophet Abraham 
went to Egypt with his wife Sarah, he was, according to the Bible itself, 75 
years old and his wife was 65. Therefore the very age of Sarah is a clear proof 
that she could not be a "fair woman to look upon" to force Prophet Abraham to 
pose that she was his sister in order to save his life. The tradition under 
discussion, which accuses Prophet Abraham to be guilty of telling a lie, has 
accordingly no basis at all and cannot be taken as reliable in spite of its 
authentic reporters. <br><br>61Literally the original Text means: "They were 
turned down upon their heads." Some commentators have interpreted it to mean: 
"They hung down their heads with shame". But this does not fit in the context 
and the wording of the Text. The right interpretation would be: "When they 
considered the answer of Prophet Abraham, they realized that they themselves 
were in the wrong, because they had set up helpless idols as deities, which 
could not even speak a word as to who had broken them. But soon after this, they 
were overpowered by obduracy and ignorance which perverted their minds and they 
again relapsed into crookedness."<br><br>62Though this is one of those miracles 
which have been clearly stated in the Qur'an, there are people who try to 
"prove" that there was no such miracle at all. According to this passage (vv. 
68-70), Prophet Abraham was actually threatened to be burnt alive and he was 
accordingly thrown into the burning fire; but Allah ordered the fire to become 
cool and harmless for him. In the face of the clear words of the Qur'an, these 
people deny this miracle because according to them it is impossible even for 
Allah to go beyond the routine of the physical laws. They say that miracles 
cannot appeal to the rationalists of the modern age, and therefore these should 
be interpreted in accordance with physical laws. They forget that according to 
the Qur'an, Allah is able to do everything, and He does extraordinary and 
unusual things which cannot be explained by "science". Therefore they should 
accept the Qur'an as it is or discard it, but they should not twist it to suit 
their so-called rationalism.<br><br>63According to the Bible, Prophet Abraham 
had two brothers, Nahor and Haran; Prophet Lot was the son of Haran (Gen. 
11:26), and he was the only person to believe in Prophet Abraham. (XXIX: 26).<br>
<br>64The "blessed land" refers to Syria and Palestine, which contains both 
material and spiritual blessings. It is one of the most fertile regions in the 
world; moreover, it was blessed for two thousand years with more Prophets than 
any other region of the world.<br><br>65That is, "We made his son a Prophet and 
his grandson too".<br><br>66This important event of the life of Prophet Abraham 
has found no mention whatever in the Bible. In fact nothing about his life in 
`Iraq -his conflict with Nimrod, his father and the community at large, his 
efforts to eradicate idolatry, the incident of his being cast into the fire, 
which ultimately led to his forced exile from the country-is mentioned anywhere 
in the Bible. The Bible merely mentions his migration, and that too, in a manner 
as if a family was migrating from one country to another in search of 
livelihood. There is another interesting difference between the Qur'an and the 
Bible. According to the Qur'an, the father of Abraham, who was a mushrik, was 
foremost in tyrannizing over his son, but the Bible gives a different account, 
which is as follows:<br><br>"Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat 
Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. And Haran died before his father 
Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. And Abram and Nahor 
took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's 
wife, Milcah the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of 
Iscah. But Sarai was barren; she had no child. And Terah took Abram 'his son, 
and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son 
Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into 
the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and settled there. And the days of 
Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran." (Gen. 
11:27-32).<br><br>"Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy 
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I 
will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, 
and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And 1 will bless them 
that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families 
of the earth be blessed." (Gen. 12: 1-3).<br><br>The Talmud, however, gives 
quite a few details about the life of Prophet Abraham about the period of his 
stay in `Iraq, which are generally the same as given in the Qur'an, but there is 
a glaring discrepancy in some of the important events. In fact, one can clearly 
feel that the account given in the Talmud is full of heterogeneous and 
hypothetical things while the one given in the Qur'an is most clear and contains 
nothing unworthy of Prophet Abraham. We reproduce below the account as given in 
the Talmud so that the reader may know the difference between the Quranic and 
Jewish versions. This will also remove the misunderstanding of those who think 
that the Qur'an has borrowed stories from the Bible or Jewish literature.<br>
<br>According to the Talmud, "The wise men saw a large star in the sky on the 
night Abram was born and they advised Nimrod to kill the child born in the house 
of Terah. The King decided to kill the child but Terah hid his child and had a 
servant's son killed in exchange. Terah thereupon hid his wife and child in a 
cave where they lived for ten years. In the 11th year Abram was taken by Terah 
to Noah, where he lived under the guidance of Noah and his son Shem for 39 
years. During the same period Abram married his niece Sarai, who was 42 years 
his junior. (The Bible does not mention that Sarai was the niece of Abram; 
moreover, the difference in their ages is mentioned as ten years). (Gen. 11: 29, 
17: 17).<br><br>The Talmud then says, "Abram left Noah at the age of 50 and came 
back to his father. Here he found that his father was an idolatry and had twelve 
idols in the house according to the twelve months of the year. He tried to 
preach to his father against idolatry but when the latter did not listen to him, 
Abram one day broke all the idols in the house. Seeing this Terah went straight 
to Nimrod and complained that the son who was born in his house 50 years ago had 
misbehaved and broken the idols. He wanted the King's verdict on this. Nimrod 
sununoned Abram for interrogation, but the replies given by Abram were straight, 
terse and clear. Nimrod sent him to jail and then referred the matter to the 
Council for a decision. The Council decided that Abram should be burnt to death. 
A fire was accordingly prepared and Abram was cast into it. His brother and 
father-in-law Haran was also similarly cast into the fire. Haran was punished 
because Nimrod enquired of Terah as to why he had another child killed in place 
of Abram when he wanted to kill Abram on the day of his birth. Terah replied 
that this was done at the instigation of Haran. Nimrod accordingly let off Terah 
but threw Haran into the fire along with Abram. Haran was burnt to death 
instantly but people saw that Abram was walking unhurt through the flames. When 
Nimrod was informed of it, he witnessed it with his own eyes and cried out: `O 
man of the God of Heaven, come out of the fire and stand before me'. Thereupon, 
Abram came out and Nimrod became one of his .believers and gave him many costly 
presents. After this, according to the Talmud, Abram stayed in `Iraq for two 
more years when Nimrod saw a dreadful dream and the astrologers told him that 
the destruction of his empire .would come through Abram and that he should, 
therefore, put him to death. Nimrod sent people to kill Abram but Abram came to 
know of the plot before-hand through Eleazar, a slave presented to him by Nimrod 
himself. Abram accordingly fled and took refuge with Noah where Terah also met 
him off and on secretly. The father and the son at last decided to leave the 
country and Noah and his son Shem also approved of their plan. Accordingly, 
Terah along with his son Abram and his grandson Lot and his grand-daughter and 
son's wife Sarai, left U: and went to Haran." (H. Polano: The Talmud Selections, 
London, pp. 30-42).<br><br>Can a reasonable person after reading this account of 
the Talmud ever imagine that this could be a source book for the story as given 
in the Qur'an?<br><br>67The original Arabic word hukm is very comprehensive. It 
means judgment, wisdom and discretion, and authority from Allah. `Ilm stands for 
the revealed knowledge of the Truth. Thus, "We bestowed hukm and `ilm on Lot": 
"We appointed Lot as a Prophet". (For the story of Lot, see VII: 80-84; Xl: 
7083; XV: 57-74 and the E.N.'s there of).<br><br>68This refers to Prophet Noah's 
prayer which he at last made after having tried his utmost to reform his people: 
"Lord, help me for I have been overpowered". (LIV: 10), and "Lord, do not leave 
even a single disbeliever on the earth." (LXXIX 26).<br><br>69"Great calamity" 
may either refer to living a miserable life among the wicked people, or to the 
Flood. (For the story of Prophet Noah, see VII: 59-64; X: 72-74; X1: 25-48, and 
XVII: 3 and the E.N.'s thereof).<br><br>70There is no mention of this event in 
the Bible nor in the Jewish literature. According to the Muslim commentators, it 
happened like this: The goats of one person entered into the field of another 
person at night. The latter brought his complaint to Prophet David who decided 
that the strayed goats should be given to the owner of the field. Prophet 
Solomon, however, differed with this and opined that the goats should remain 
with the owner of the field up to the time that the former tilled and prepared 
the field as before. In regard to this Allah says, "We led Solomon to the right 
decision". As regards the legal aspect of the matter we cannot say with 
certainty what is the Islamic law in such a case nor is there any Tradition of 
the Holy Prophet to explain or support it. That is why the jurists have differed 
about it.<br><br>It should, however, be noted that in this context, the incident 
has been cited to show that the Prophets were after all human beings in spite of 
their God given powers and abilities. In this case, Prophet David committed an 
error of judgment because he was not guided by Allah as was Prophet Solomon, 
though both of them were Prophets. In the succeeding passage the wonderful 
powers of both have been mentioned to show that they were God-given and did not 
snake anyone a god.<br><br>Incidentally, we learn froth this verse that if two 
judges give different decisions about one and the same case, both of them will 
be regarded as righteous, though the decision of only one of them will be 
correct, provided that both are duly qualified for sitting in judgment on the 
case. The Holy Prophet has stated the same principle more elaborately. In a 
Tradition of Bukhari, he is reported by 'Amar bin 'As to have said, "If a judge 
does his very best to arrive at the right decision, he will get a double reward 
in case of a right judgment and a single reward if his judgment is wrong." 
According to another Tradition, cited by Abu Da'ud and Ibn Majah, on the 
authority of Buraidah, he is reported to have said, "Judges are of three kinds 
and only one of them will go to Paradise: the one who recognizes the Truth and 
decides according to it. On the other hand, the one who recognizes the Truth but 
gives his decision against it, will go to Hell, and he too, who sits in judgment 
on a case without the necessary knowledge (and competence). "<br><br>71From the 
wording of the Text, it is clear that "the mountains and the birds" were not 
subjected to Prophet David but were joined with him in glorifying Allah. This is 
also supported by XXXVIII:I9: "We had subdued the mountains by Our Command so 
that they praised Us with him (David) in the morning and evening, and the birds 
too, which gathered together and repeated Our praise with him". And, according 
to XXXIV: 10: "We commanded the mountains to repeat Our praise with him and also 
the birds to do the same. " We are of the opinion that it means this: "When 
Prophet David sang hymns of Allah's praise and glory, in his rich and sweet 
voice, the mountains echoed back his melodies and the birds gathered round him 
and the whole scene became charming." Our interpretation is supported by this 
Tradition:<br><br>"Once when Hadrat Abu Musa Ash`ari, who had an extremely sweet 
voice, was reciting the Holy Qur'an, the Holy Prophet, who was passing by, stood 
and listened to him for a long time. When he finished the recital, the Holy 
Prophet remarked: 'This man has been granted a portion of the melody of David'."<br>
<br>72According to XXXIV: 10-11, it was like this: "....And We made the iron 
soft for him (and commanded him): `Make coats of mail complete in every way, and 
arrange the plates properly...."'. This shows that Allah had made Prophet David 
an expert in the use of iron, and had especially taught him the art of an 
armorer for defense purposes. This fact is confirmed by archaeological and 
historical researches, for according to these the iron-age in the world started 
between 1200 and 1000 BC and this was precisely the period of Prophet David. At 
tirst the Hittites in Syria and Asia Minor, who flourished between 2000 and 1200 
BC, discovered a method of melting and molding iron, but they guarded it as a 
close secret from the world, and it could not be put to common use. Later on, 
the Philistines came to know of it, but they too guarded it as a secret. The 
incessant defeats suffered by the Israelites at the hands of the Hittites and 
the Philistines before King Saul, were due mainly to the use of chariots of iron 
in their wars by the latter. (Joshua, 17:16; Judges, 1: 19, 4: 2-3). In 1020 BC 
when Saul became ruler over the Israelites by Allah's Command, he subdued the 
Canaanites and recaptured most of Palestine. After him Prophet David (1004-965 
BC) not only annexed the whole of Palestine and Jordan to the Israeli kingdom 
but a major portion of Syria as well. This was the time when the secret of armor 
making closely guarded by the Hittites and the Philistines, became well known 
and cheaper articles of daily use began to be made. The recent archaeological 
excavations conducted in Edom, to the south of Palestine, which is rich in iron 
ore, have brought to light furnaces for melting and molding iron. The furnace 
excavated near Ezion-geber, a port on the Gulf of `Aqabah, in the time of 
Prophet Solomon, seems to have been built on the principles which are used in 
the modern blast furnaces. It is therefore natural that Prophet David must have 
first of all utilized this discovery for war purposes, because a little earlier 
the hostile Canaanites around his kingdom had made life really difficult for his 
people. The Bible also says that Prophet David was an expert in the art of 
melting and using iron for war purposes. (See Joshua, 17: 16; Judges, 1:19 and 
4: 2-3).<br><br>73For further details about Prophet David, please see II:251 and 
XVII: 55 and the E.N.'s thereof.<br><br>74This is also explained in XXXIV: 12: 
"And for Solomon We had subjected the wind which covered a month's journey in 
the morning and a month's journey in the evening", and in XXXVIII: 36: "So We 
subjected the wind to him. It blew softly at his bidding whither-soever he 
wanted it to blow." Thus it is clear that the wind was so subjected to Prophet 
Solomon that the voyages to places at one month's sea journey could be performed 
conveniently, because a favorable wind was always blowing for his ships to and 
from those places.<br><br>It is confirmed by the Bible that Prophet Solomon had 
developed sea trade on a large scale. ( I Kings, 10: 22). On the one side, his 
trade ships sailed from Ezion-geber, through the Red Sea, towards Yaman and 
other southern and eastern lands, and on the other, his naval fleet called Thar-shish, 
sailed on the Mediterranean to the western countries. The great furnace which he 
had built at Ezion-geber for melting and molding ores extracted from the copper 
and iron mines in the `Arabah in Edom, has been confirmed by modem 
archaeological researches as well. This molten iron and copper was used in 
building ships besides being put to other uses. The Qur'an refers to this when 
it says: "....and We made a fountain of molten copper to flow for him 
(Solomon)...." (XXXIV:12).<br><br>As ,regards the subjection of the wind, it may 
mean that Allah, by His special favor, had so arranged that the wind-and sea 
voyages in those days depended entirely on wind-was always favorable for Prophet 
Solomon's fleet. But if we take the literal meaning of v. 81: "it sped at his 
bidding", there will be no harm, for Allah is able to give such powers to any of 
His servants He pleases. <br><br>75The subjection of "satans" has been explained 
in XXXIV:12-13. Incidentally, these verses of the Qur'an clearly show that the 
satans and jinns who worked for Prophet Solomon belonged to quite a different 
genus from human beings. Therefore, it is wrong to pervert the Qur'an to prove 
that "they were human beings" as some modernist commentators have tried to do. 
It is obvious from the wording of the Qur'an and the context in which the story 
of the jinns has been related, that they were not human beings. Had they been so 
this would have been no special favor to Solomon, because human beings had 
already built the gigantic monuments like the pyramids of Egypt.<br><br>76There 
is a wide divergence of opinion concerning the personality, period and 
nationality of Prophet Job. Some commentators opine that he was an Israelite, 
while others think that he was an Egyptian or an Arab who lived before Prophet 
Moses, or during the time of Prophets David and Solomon. As all these 
conjectures are based on the Book of Job, which is self-contradictory and 
against the Qur'an, nothing can be said about him with certainty, but in the 
light of the Book of Isaiah (8th century BC) and the Book of Ezekiel (6th 
century BC), which are more trustworthy works, he lived in the 9th century BC or 
even earlier. As regards his nationality, the context in which his name occurs 
in IV: 163 and VI: 84, it may be assumed that he was an Israelite. According to 
a saying of Hadrat Wahb bin Munabbih, he might have been from the offspring of 
Esau, a son of Prophet Isaac.<br><br>77The words of the prayer are note-worthy. 
Prophet Job mentions his distress but does not say anything more to his Lord 
except: "Thou art most Merciful" This is a great proof of his fortitude, noble 
and contented nature.<br><br>78How his disease was cured has been explained in 
XXXVIII: 42: "Stamp the ground with your foot: here is cool water for you to 
wash with and to drink." From this it appears that no sooner did he stamp the 
ground than a spring gushed forth. He took bath and drank the water and was 
cured of his disease. The nature of the treatment hints that he was suffering 
from a skin disease. This is confirmed by the Bible as well. "Satan smote Job 
with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. "- (Job, 2:7). <br>
<br>79It will be worth-while to compare the high character of Prophet Job as 
given in the Qur'an with that in the Book of Job in the Bible. The Qur'an 
presents him as a veritable picture of patience and fortitude and an-excellent 
model for the worshippers of Allah, but his general picture presented in the 
Book of Job is that of a man who is full of grievance against God: "Let the day 
perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man 
child conceived .... Let them curse (the night) that curse the day, .....Because 
it shut not the doors of my mother's womb, nor did sorrow from mine eyes. Why 
died I not from the womb?^ (Chapter 3)..... "Oh that my grief were thoroughly 
weighed, and my calamity laid in the balance together.....the arrows of the 
Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of 
God do set themselves in array against me." (Chapter 6).... "I have sinned; what 
shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark 
against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? And why dost thou not pardon my 
transgressions, and take away my iniquity? (Chapter 7: 20-21).<br><br>His three 
friends try to console him and counsel patience, but in vain. He says, "My soul 
is weary of my life....l will speak in the bitterness of my soul" (10:1).... "I 
have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all." (16: .... "So 
these three men ceased to answer Job ..... Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu.... 
against Job.... because he justified himself rather than God." (32:1-3), but he 
also failed to console him....Then the Lord himself came down and condemned the 
three friends and Elihu and rebuked Job and then forgave him, accepted him and 
blessed him." (Chapters 41, 42). It should be noted that in the first two 
chapters of this Book, Prophet Job is presented as a perfect and upright man who 
feared God, but in the following chapters he becomes an embodiment of grievance 
against God, as though the estimate of Satan about him was correct and that of 
God incorrect. Thus this Book itself is a clear evidence that it is neither the 
Word of God nor of Prophet lob but had been written afterwards by some literary 
man and incorporated in the Bible as a scripture.<br><br>80For explanation, see 
Surah Maryam (XIX): E. N. 33.<br><br>81Zul-Kifl is not the name but the title of 
a righteous man, which literally means 'a man of luck'. Here it does not refer 
to worldly prosperity but to his high character and ranks in the Hereafter. He 
has also been mentioned by this title in XXXVIII: 48. There are different 
opinions about his identity and nationality: some have regarded him as Zacharias 
(but this is not correct because Zacharias has been mentioned separately in v. 
89); others say he was Elias, or Joshua, son of Nun, or Elisha, but this again 
is incorrect, because in Surah Sad (XXXVIII: '49) Elisha and Zul-Kifl have been 
mentioned as separate personalities; some others say that he was Prophet Job's 
son, named Bishr, who succeeded him as Prophet.<br><br>Allamah Alusi says, "The 
Jews claim that he was Ezekiel who was appointed to Prophethood during the 
captivity (597 BC) of the Israelites and he performed his mission in a 
habitation by the side of the Chebar canal."<br><br>These conflicting opinions 
indeed confirm nothing. The modern commentators, however, are inclined to 
believe that he was Ezekiel, though there is no convincing argument about it. 
This opinion is sound because his description in this verse "that he was a 
patient and righteous man and was blessed by God" is fully confirmed by the Book 
of Ezekiel. He was one of those people who had been taken prisoner by 
Nebuchadnezzer at the downfall of Jerusalem, who settled the Israeli exiles at 
Tel-abib by the river Chebar in Iraq. Here, in 594 BC, Ezekiel was raised to 
Prophethood when he was hardly 30, and he continued preaching the message of God 
to the exiled Israelites as well as to the iniquitous people and rulers of 
Jerusalem for full 22 years. In the 9th year of his mission, his wife whom he 
called "the desire of his eyes" died, but when the people came to mourn her 
death, he warned them of the wrath of God and the impending disaster. (Chapter 
24: I5-21). The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel in the Bible is one of those 
scriptures which appear to be genuine and divinely' inspired.<br><br>82That is, 
Jonah. Literally Zun-Nun means “the man of the fish." He was called so because 
he was devoured by a fish by the Command of Allah. (Also See XXXV11:142 and X:98 
and its E.N.'s 98-100).<br><br>83Prophet Jonah left his people before he 
received Allah's Command for migration.<br><br>84He presumed that he should 
leave, the place which was going to be visited by the scourge of Allah. This was 
not by itself an offence but it was an offence for a Prophet to leave the place 
of his Mission without the permission of Allah.<br><br>85"....darkness": the 
darkness in the belly of the fish and the darkness of the sea over and above 
it."<br><br>86"Made his wife fit": "We cured his wife of sterility." As "Thou 
alone art the best Inheritor", I shall have no grief even if Thou dost not give 
the any child. (For further details, please see III:37-41 and XIX: 2-14 and the 
E.N.'s thereof).<br><br>87It will be worth while to reiterate the reasons why 
the stories of the Prophets have been cited in this surah.<br><br>(1) The story 
of Prophet Zacharias has been cited to impress on the minds that all the 
Prophets were human beings and servants of Allah and had no tinge of Godhead in 
them. They had no power to bestow children upon others because they themselves 
had to pray to Allah for children for themselves.<br><br>(2) The story of 
Prophet Jonah has been cited to show that even a great Prophet like him did not 
go unnoticed when he committed an error in regard to Allah's Message. But when 
he repented, Allah, by His grace, delivered him alive from the belly of the 
fish.<br><br>(3) The mention of Prophet Job has been made to show that even 
Prophets were put to hard trials and afflictions and even they had to beg Allah 
to restore them to health, not to speak of curing others of diseases.<br><br>
Along with these, the other important thing which is meant to be impressed is 
that all the Prophets believed in the doctrine of Tauhid. That is why they 
begged and prayed to One Allah alone to fulfill their needs and requirements. 
Though they met with trials, Allah helped them and granted their prayers in 
supernatural and miraculous ways.<br><br>88That is, "Mary (Allah's peace be upon 
her)".<br><br>89It should be noted that the incident of the birth of Prophet 
Jesus was not different from that of Prophet Adam, because the wording of the 
Arabic Text in the two cases is almost identical: (See XXXVIII: 71-72). Besides 
this in verse 91 , almost similar words have beets used in regard to the birth 
of Jesus Christ. (See also IV: l71 and LXVI:12). Allah Himself has stated that 
the birth of Prophet Jesus was just like the birth of Prophet Adam: "In the 
sight of Allah, the case of the birth of Jesus is like that of Adam, whom He 
created out of dust and said, 'Be', and he was." (III: 59).In the light of these 
verses, we may conclude that Allah uses words like: "We breathed into him or her 
of Our spirit" for miraculous births. (For fuller details please see IV: E.N's 
212-213).<br><br>90That is, "The mother and the son were not partners of God nor 
had any share whatever in Godhead, but were a Sign from among the Signs of God." 
(See XIX: E.N. 21 also).<br><br>91In this verse, the addressees are the whole of 
mankind. It means: "O mankind, in reality all of you belonged to one community 
and had one and the same religion and all the Prophets brought one and the same 
Creed which was this: `Allah alone is the Lord of all mankind: therefore they 
should worship Him alone. "' But afterwards the people corrupted this Creed and 
invented and adopted the things they liked and mixed their own theories, whims 
and practices in it. This brought into being countless communities and 
religions. Thus it is absolutely wrong to say that a particular Prophet was the 
founder of a particular religion and another of another, and so on. The very 
fact that different religions came into being at different periods of tithe, 
does not prove that the Prophets created these differences. It is obvious that 
the Prophets of God could not found different religions nor could they teach 
their followers to worship any beings other than Allah.<br><br>92The Arabic Text 
of v. 95 may be interpreted in three ways:<br><br>(I) The community which is 
once destroyed by the scourge of Allah can never have a second or new life.<br>
<br>(2) After its destruction, its people are not given a second chance for 
their test: then they shall be presented in the Court of Allah for final 
judgment.<br><br>(3) When a community transgresses the last limits in its 
wickedness, injustices and disobedience, and Allah ordains to destroy it,no 
other chance of repentance is given to it because it becomes incapable of 
turning back to right guidance.<br><br>93For the details about Gog and Magog, 
see E.N.'s 62 and 69 of Surah A1-Kahf (XVIII). They will be let loose in the 
sense that they will swoop down on the regions of the earth like a beast of prey 
which is set free from its cage suddenly. "The time of the fulfillment of the 
true promise" will come on the eve of Resurrection and the appearance of Gog and 
Magog will be a sign of it. In a Tradition related in Muslim, by Huzaifah bin 
Asid Ghifari, the Holy Prophet said, "Resurrection will not take place until ten 
signs appear:<br><br>(1) The smoke. (2) Dajjal. (3) Daabat-ul-Ard. (4) rising of 
the sun from the west. (5) coming down of Jesus, son of Mary. (6) sudden attack 
of Gog and Magog. (7-9) three land slides-one in the east, the second in the 
west and the third in Arabia. (10) the flare up of a great fire from Yaman which 
will drive the people to the Plain of Resurrection. In another Tradition the 
Holy Prophet stated that after the swoop of Gog and Magog, Resurrection will. be 
so near that it may take place at any moment just as a pregnant woman might 
deliver the child at any moment, in the day or night, after her term has 
expired. But the reference to the appearance of Gog and Magog in the Qur'an and 
Hadith does not indicate that they will swoop on mankind jointly; it may be that 
they will clash against each other near the time of Resurrection and their 
mutual conflict might result in a universal catastrophe and destruction. <br>
<br>94"We were heedless of this" contains a kind of excuse in it, as if to say, 
"The Prophets warned us of the Day of Resurrection but we were wrongdoers and 
paid no heed to their warning".<br><br>95We learn from traditions that `Abdullah 
bin Azza'ara raised an objection in this connection, saying, "According to this 
not only our deities but Prophets Jesus and `Uzair and the Angels also will 
become fuel for Hell because they are also worshiped." The Holy Prophet replied, 
"Yes, everyone who would approve of his own worship instead of Allah's will go 
to Hell along with those who worshiped him." He meant to say, "There is no 
reason why Prophets Jesus and `Uzair and the Angels should go to Hell because 
they never approved that they should be worshiped instead of Allah, and were not 
responsible for this, on the other hand, they taught people to worship Allah 
alone". Of course, those who tried to become deities and became partners in the 
shirk of others will certainly go to Hell along with their worshipers. Likewise 
those, who induced others to take deities other than Allah, will go to Hell. 
Satan comes under this category for he induces others to make deities. Thus it 
is Satan who is made the real deity whom they obey and commit shirk Besides 
this, idols of stone and wood and other accessories of shirk will also be thrown 
into Hell along with the mushriks so that the latter should see that their 
deities were becoming a cause of the intensity of their torture of fire instead 
of becoming their intercessors.<br><br>96The Arabic word (zafir) means `hard 
breathing' because of excessive heat, hard work and weariness.<br><br>97These 
will be the people who practiced virtue and righteousness in this world. Allah 
has already promised that they will be kept safe from the torture and will be 
granted salvation.<br><br>98That is, "The time of mustering and going before 
Allah will be very dreadful for the common people but the righteous people will 
have full peace of mind because everything will be happening according to their 
expectations. Their faith and the righteous deeds they did in the world, will 
help console them by the grace of Allah and, instead of grief and sorrow, they 
will be filled with the hope that they are going to get their promised rewards."<br>
<br>99The interpretation of this verse has given rise to a great 
misunderstanding. Some people have tried to interpret it in a way, which is 
entirely opposed to the ideology of the Qur'an. They interpret it to mean: "The 
inheritance of the kingdom and the resources of the earth are given to the 
righteous people alone in this worldly life, and upon them alone Allah showers 
His favours and blessings." Then they apply this formula conversely and conclude 
that the gift of this inheritance of the earth is the sole criterion between the 
"righteous" and the "unrighteous" men. The righteous is the one who inherits the 
sovereignty of the earth and the unrighteous the one who is deprived of this 
inheritance. But when they apply their formula in the historical perspective, 
they find that most of those nations which have inherited the earth in the past 
and are inheriting it today, have been and are mostly disbelieving, mushriks, 
atheists and immoral, and that these are not the characteristics of the 
righteous people when judged by the criterion put forward by the Qur'an. From 
Nimrod and Pharaoh to the present day communist despots, who have been 
inheriting the earth, were and are unbelievers and the enemies of God and 
therefore could not be considered righteous, according to the Quranic formula. 
Faced with this situation, they start arguing that there must be some error in 
the conception of the "righteous" which should be such as would fit all the 
inheritors of the earth whether they were Caliphs like Abu Bakr Siddiq and `Umar 
Faruq or Chingez and Halaku. This research leads them to the Darwinian theory of 
the survival of the fittest and they assume fitness to be a synonym of 
"righteousness".<br><br>According to this new conception or definition of 
"righteousness", the proposition would plainly mean: "Any person, or a group of 
persons, who is capable of conquering and subduing countries by military force 
and has the ability to exploit the resources of the earth successfully is a 
`righteous servant of Allah' and his achievement is a criterion and message of 
righteousness and worship for other human beings to follow. Consequently, if 
they fail to achieve the inheritance of the earth, they will neither be regarded 
among the righteous nor among the servants of Allah". As a result of this 
interpretation of the verse, and this conception of "righteousness" and 
"service", they were confronted with the interpretation of some basic and 
fundamental articles of the Islamic Faith. For instance, according to the 
Qur'an, no deed, howsoever good, could be regarded as righteous without belief 
in Allah, the Hereafter, the Prophets and the Books. Moreover, the invitation of 
the Prophet to accept the moral and legal systems of Islam would become 
meaningless. Then these people could not reconcile their interpretation with the 
teachings of the Qur'an that obedience to the Holy Prophet and the Commandments 
of Allah was absolutely essential for a righteous tnan and that the lack of this 
would make a person a disbeliever and a transgressor who deserved the wrath of 
Allah. If they had faced this problem boldly and honestly, they would have 
realized that their interpretation was wrong, but instead of this, they very 
impudently changed the universally accepted conception of Faith, Islam, Tauhid, 
Prophethood and the Hereafter in order to make these basic articles of the Faith 
fit in with their interpretation of this verse. Thus, they turned all the 
teachings of the Qur'an upside down and tampered with its meaning without the 
least hesitation. Now let us consider their interpretation and point out its 
errors:<br><br>(1) Their interpretation contradicts the teachings of the Qur'an 
as a whole, for according to these virtue, piety and goodness do not comprise 
material progress and ability to rule over the land. Moreover, if the Quranic 
word "Salih" (virtuous, good) is regarded as synonymous with "Sahib Salahiyyat" 
(i.e. possessor of fitness and competence), this one verse will clash with the 
whole of the Qur'an.<br><br>(2) They isolate this verse from its context and 
ascribe to it whatever meaning they like; otherwise, they would have seen that 
the "inheritance" referred to in the context is the promise to the Believers 
which is to be fulfilled in the Hereafter, and thus has nothing to do with 
inheritance in this world.<br><br>If this verse is interpreted in the context in 
which it occurs, it becomes very plain from the preceding verses that this 
promise to the righteous people holds good for the life in the Hereafter. This 
thing has been made more explicit in XXXIX: 73-74. According to this passage 
(which is definitely about life in the Hereafter), when the pious people will 
enter into Paradise, they will say: "God be praised, Who has fulfilled His 
promise and made us heirs to the land."<br><br>Now let us consider this matter 
in the light of the Psalms (whether the Book of Psalms in the Bible is genuine 
or tampered with, because the real Psalms of Prophet David are nowhere 
available) to which this verse refers. According to 37:9-29: "....evildoers 
shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the 
earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt 
diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit 
the ' earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace....and their 
inheritance shall be for ever....The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell 
therein for ever." Thus the Psalms also confirm word for word verse 105. It is 
obvious that "(They shall) dwell therein for ever" refers to the life in the 
Hereafter.<br><br>As regards the inheritance of the earth in this worldly life, 
Allah gives it as a heritage to those of His servants whom He pleases (VII:128), 
irrespective of whether they are believers or disbelievers, righteous or wicked, 
not as a reward but for their trial. "....Your Lord will make you rulers on the 
earth, and then He will see how you conduct yourselves." (VII:129). The heritage 
of the earth in this worldly life is neither permanent nor everlasting. It is 
merely bestowed as a trial for different communities. On the other hand, the 
heritage of the "land" referred to in v. 105 is permanent and for ever and, 
according to the Qur'an, it will be bestowed on the basis of this formula: "The 
land belongs to Allah and He will make only His righteous servants heirs to it 
not for their test but as a permanent reward for the righteous attitude they 
adopted in this worldly life."<br><br>100This verse (107) can also be translated 
as: "We have sent you only as a blessing for the people of the world". In both 
cases it will mean that the appointment of the Holy Prophet is indeed a blessing 
and mercy of Allah to the whole world. This is because he aroused the neglectful 
world froth its heedlessness and gave it the knowledge of the criterion between 
truth and falsehood, and warned it very clearly of both the ways of salvation 
and. ruin. This fact has been stated here 'to tell the disbelievers of Makkah 
that they were quite wrong in their estimate of the Holy Prophet that he was an 
affliction and distress for them because they said, "This man has sown seeds of 
discard among our clans and separated near relatives from each other." They have 
been told here, "O foolish people, you are wrong to presume that he is an 
affliction for you; but he is in reality a blessing and mercy of Allah for you."<br>
<br>101That is, "I do not know the time and the form of the punishment of Allah 
for your rejection of the Message. It tray come at any time in any shape."<br>
<br>102This refers to their secret schemes, plots and their whispering campaign 
which have been mentioned in v. 3. There, too, the Prophet had said, "My Lord 
has the knowledge of everything that is said in the heavens or the earth for He 
is All-Hearing, All-Knowing". (v. 4). This was to warn them that they would be 
taken to task for these things, too.<br><br>103This was a "trial" because the 
delay in the "punishment" was deluding them into believing "All the things put 
forward by the Prophet are false: had he been a true Prophet of Allah we would 
have been punished long before this for our disbelief." They did not realize 
that the reason for the delay was that Allah willed to give them respite for 
mending their ways.</p>
