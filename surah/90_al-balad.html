                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
                        <p>The Surah has been so named after the word al balad in the first verse.</p>
                        <p><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>Its subject matter and style resemble those of the
                          earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah, but it contains a pointer which indicates
                          that it was sent down in the period when the disbelievers of Makkah had resolved
                          to oppose the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace), and made it lawful for
                        themselves to commit tyranny and excess against him.</p>
                        <p><strong>Theme and Subject Matter</strong><br>
                          <br>In this Surah a vast subject has been compressed into a few brief sentences,
                          and it is a miracle of the Quran that a complete ideology of life which could
                          hardly be explained in a thick volume has been abridged most effectively in
                          brief sentences of this short Surah. Its theme is to explain the true position
                          of man in the world and of the world in relation to man and to tell that God has
                          shown to man both the highways of good and evil, has also provided for him the
                          means to judge and see and follow them, and now it rests upon mans own effort
                          and judgment whether he chooses the path of virtue and reaches felicity or
                          adopts the path of vice and meets with doom.<br><br>First, the city of Makkah
                          and the hardships being faced therein by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
                          and the state of the children of Adam have been cited as a witness to the truth
                          that this world is not a place of rest and ease for man, where he might have
                          been born to enjoy life, but here he has been created into toil and struggle. If
                          this theme is read with verse 39 of Surah An-Najm (Laisa lil insani illa ma saa:
                          there is nothing for man but what he has striven for), it becomes plain that in
                          this world the future of man depends on his toil and struggle, effort and
                          striving.<br><br>After this, man's misunderstanding that he is all in all in
                          this world and that there is no superior power to watch what he does and to call
                          him to account, has been refuted.<br><br>Then, taking one of the many moral
                          concepts of ignorance held by man, as an example, it has been pointed out what
                          wrong criteria of merit and greatness he has proposed for himself in the world.
                          The person who for ostentation and display squanders heaps of wealth, not only
                          himself prides upon his extravagances but the people also admire him for it
                          enthusiastically, whereas the Being Who is watching over his deeds, sees by what
                          methods he obtained the wealth and in what ways and with what motives and
                          intention he spent it.<br><br>Then Allah says: We have given man the means of
                          knowledge and the faculties of thinking and understanding and opened up before
                          him both the highways of virtue and vice: one way leads down to moral depravity,
                          and it is an easy way pleasing for the self; the other way leads up to moral
                          heights, which is steep like an uphill road, for scaling which man has to
                          exercise self- restraint. It is man's weakness that he prefers slipping down
                          into the abyss to scaling the cliff.<br><br>Then, Allah has explained what the
                          steep road is by following which man can ascend to the heights. It is that he
                          should give up spending for ostentation, display and pride and should spend his
                          wealth to help the orphans and the needy, should believe in Allah and His
                          Religion and joining the company of believers should participate in the
                          construction of a society which should fulfill the demands of virtue and
                          righteousness patiently and should be compassionate to the people. The end of
                          those who follow this way is that they would become worthy of Allah's mercies.
                          On the contrary, the end of those who follow the wrong way, is the fire of Hell
                          from which there is no escape. <br><br>As we have explained in
                          E.N.1 of Surah AI-Qiyamah above, to begin a discourse with a "Nay" and resume it
                          with an oath means that the people were asserting a wrong thing to refute which
                          it was said: "Nay, the truth is not that which you seem to assert, but I swear
                          by such and such a thing that the truth is this and this" As for the question
                          what it was to refute which this discourse was sent down, it is indicated by the
                          theme that follows. The disbelievers of Makkah said that there was nothing wrong
                          with the way of life that they were following, as if to say: "Eat, drink and be
                          merry for tomorrow we die in the natural process of time. Muhammad (upon whom be
                          Allah's peace), without any reason, is finding fault with this way of life and
                          warning us that we would at some time in the future be called to account for it
                          and rewarded and punished accordingly." <br><br>2"This City": the city of Makkah.
                          There was no need here to explain why an oath was being sworn by this City. The
                          people of Makkah were well aware of the background and importance of their city
                          and knew how in the midst of desolate mountains, in an un-cultivated, barren
                          valley, the Prophet Abraham had brought his wife and suckling child and left
                          them there without any support; how he had built a House there and proclaimed to
                          the people to visit it as pilgrims when there was no soul for miles around to
                          hear the proclamation, and then how this city had eventually become the
                          commercial and religious center of Arabia and was blessed with such sacredness
                          that there was no other place of security beside it in that lawless land for
                          centuries. <br><br>3Three meanings of the words in the Text have been given by
                          the commentators:<br><br>(1) "That you are a resident of this city and your
                          residence here has further enhanced the glory of this city";<br><br>(2) "that
                          although this city is a sanctuary; a time will come when for some time it will
                          become lawful for you to fight and kill the enemies of the true Faith here; and,<br>
                          <br>(3) "that in this city where even killing of animals and cutting of trees is
                          forbidden for the people of Arabia, and where everyone is living in perfect
                          peace, you, O Prophet, have no peace, and persecuting you and devising plans to
                          kill you has been made lawful."<br><br>Although the words are comprehensive
                          enough to cover all the three meanings, yet when the theme that follows is
                          considered, one feels that the first two meanings bear no relevance to it, and
                          only the third meaning seems to be correct. <br><br>4As the words "father and
                          children he begot" have been used indefinitely, and this is followed by the
                          mention of man, father could only imply Adam (peace be on him) and children the
                          human beings who existed in the world, exist today and will exist in the future.<br>
                          <br>5This is that for which the oaths as mentioned above have been sworn. Man's
                          being created in toil means that man in this world has not been created to enjoy
                          himself and live a life of ease and comfort, but the world for him is a place of
                          enduring and undergoing toil, labor and hardship, and no man can be immune from
                          this. The city of Makkah is a witness that a servant of Allah toiled and
                          struggled hard, then only did it become a city and the center of Arabia. In this
                          city of Makkah the condition of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) is a
                          witness that he is enduring every kind of hardship for the sake of a mission; so
                          much so that there is full peace here for the wild animals but no peace for him.
                          Then, every man's survival, from the tithe he is conceived in the mother's womb
                          till the last breath of life, is a witness that he has to pass through trouble,
                          toil, labor, dangers and hardships at every step. The most fortunate of us is
                          also exposed to grave dangers of death before birth or of elimination by
                          abortion while in the mother's womb. At birth he is only a hair-breadth away
                          from death. After birth he is so helpless that had there not been somebody to
                          look after him, he would perish uncared for and un-noticed. When he became able
                          to walk he stumbled at every step. Froth childhood to youth and old age he had
                          to pass through such physical changes that if any change had taken a wrong turn,
                          his very life would have been at stake. Even if he is a king or a dictator, he
                          at no time enjoys internal peace from the tear that a rebellion might arise
                          against him somewhere. Even if he is a conqueror he is never at peace from the
                          danger that one of his generals might rise in revolt against him Even if he is a
                          Korah of his time, he is ever anxious to increase his wealth and to safeguard
                          it. Thus, there is no one who may he enjoying perfect peace freely and without
                          hesitation, for man indeed has been created into a life of toil and trouble. <br>
                          <br>6That is: Is man, who is ever exposed to such hazards, involved in the
                          delusion that he can do what he likes, and there is no superior power to seize
                          and suppress him? The fact, however, is that even before the occurrence of the
                          Hereafter in this world itself, he sees that his destiny every moment is being
                          ruled by some other Being against Whose decrees all his plans and designs prove
                          ineffective. A single jolt of the earthquake, a blast of wind, a flood in the
                          river and a sea-storm are enough to show how weak and feeble man is against the
                          Divine forces. A sudden accident can reduce a strong and robust person to a
                          cripple; one turn of the fortune deposes a mighty sovereign froth the position
                          of authority. When the fortunes of the nations, which have climbed to the very
                          apex of glory and prosperity, change, they are humiliated and disgraced even in
                          the world where do one could dare look them in the face. How has then this man
                          been deluded into thinking that no one else can have power over him ? <br><br>
                          7Literally: "I have destroyed heaps of wealth", i.e. squandered and wasted it.
                          These words show how proud the speaker was of his wealth. The heaps of wealth
                          that he spent was so insignificant as against his total wealth that he did not
                          mind squandering it carelessly. And to what purpose did he squander it'? Not for
                          a genuine, good cause as becomes evident from the following verses, but for
                          display of his wealth and expression of his pride and glory. Bestowing rich
                          awards on , poetic admirers, inviting and feeding hundreds of thousands of
                          people on marriage and death ceremonies, gambling away heaps of wealth,
                          attending festivals with large entourages, trying to excel others in display of
                          glory and grandeur, having heaps of food cooked on ceremonial occasions and
                          throwing invitations to all and sundry to come and eat, or arranging and
                          supplying running meals at the residence so as to impress the people around with
                          one's generosity and largeheartedness; such were the expenditures of
                          ostentation, which in the days of ignorance were regarded as a symbol of man's
                          munificence and magnanmity, and a sign of his greatness. For these they were
                          praised and admired; on these their Praises were sung; and on account of these
                          they prided themselves against the less fortunate.<br><br>8That is, "Doesn't
                          this boaster understand that there is also a God above him, Who sees by what
                          means he obtained this wealth, in what ways he spent it, and with what
                          intention, motive, and purpose he did all this ? Does he think that God will put
                          any value on his extravagance, his fame-mongering and his boasting Does he think
                          that like the world, God too will be deluded by it?"<br><br>9That is, "Have We
                          not given him the means of obtaining knowledge and wisdom '?" "Two eyes" does
                          not imply the eyes of the cow and buffalo, but human eyes, which if used
                          intelligently can help man see all around himself those signs which lead to the
                          reality and distinguish the right from the wrongs. "The tongue and lips" do not
                          merely imply the instruments of speech but the rational wind behind these
                          instruments which performs the functions of thinking and understanding and then
                          uses them for expressing its ideas, motives and designs. <br><br>10That is, "We
                          have not left him alone after granting him the faculties of thinking and
                          reasoning so that he may have to search out his own way, but We have also guided
                          him and opened up before him both the highways of good and evil, virtue and
                          vice, so that he may consider them seriously and choose and adopt one or the
                          other way on his own responsibility. This same subject has been expressed in
                          Surah Ad-Dahr: 2-3, thus: "Indeed We created man from a mixed sperm-drop, to try
                          him, and so We made him capable of hearing and seeing. We showed him the way,
                          whether to be grateful or disbelieving. " For explanation, see E.N.'s 3 to S of
                          Ad-Dahr. <br><br>11The words in the original are: fa-lagtaham-al- aqabah.
                          Iqtiham means to apply oneself to a hard and toilsome task, and 'aqabah is the
                          steep path that passes through mountains for ascending heights. Thus, the verse
                          means: "One of the two paths that We have shown him, leads to heights but is
                          toilsome and steep; man has to tread it against the desires of his self and the
                          temptations of Satan. The other path is easy which descends into chasms, but
                          does not require any toil from man; one only needs to give free reins to
                          oneself, then one automatically goes on rolling down the abyss. Now, the man to
                          whom We had shown both the paths, adopted the easy down-hill path and abandoned
                          the toilsome path, which leads to the heights." <br><br>12Since in the foregoing
                          verses the extravagances of man which he indulges in for ostentation and
                          expression of superiority to others, have been mentioned, now here it is being
                          stated as to what expenditure of wealth it is which leads man up to moral
                          heights instead of causing him to sink into moral depravity and perversion. But
                          in this there is no enjoyment for the self; on the contrary, man has to exercise
                          self-restraints and make sacrifices. The expenditure is that one should set a
                          slave free, or should render a slave monetary help so as to enable him to win
                          his freedom by paying the ransom, or free a debtor from his debt, or secure
                          release of a helpless person without means from penalties. Likewise, the
                          expenditure is that one should feed a nearly related orphan (i.e. an orphan who
                          is either a relative or a neighbor) who is hungry, and a needy, helpless person
                          who might have been reduced to extreme poverty and might have none to support
                          and help him. Helping such people does not win a person fame and reputation, nor
                          feeding them brings him the admiration for being wealthy and generous which one
                          usually wins by holding banquets to thousands of well-to-do people. But the path
                          to moral and spiritual heights passes on steep uphill roads only.<br><br>Great
                          merits of the acts of virtue mentioned in these verses have been described by
                          the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace). For instance, about fakku raqabah
                          (fleeing a neck from bondage) many ahadith have been related in the traditions,
                          one of which is a tradition from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, to the effect; "The Holy
                          Prophet said: The person who set a believing slave free, Allah will save from
                          fire of Hell every limb of his body in lieu of every limb of the slave's body,
                          the hand in lieu of the hand, the foot in lies of the foot, the private parts in
                          lieu of the private parts " (Musnad, Ahmad, Bukhari. Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i).
                          Hadrat 'Ali bin Husain (lmam Zain al-`Abedin) asked Sa`d bin Marjanah, the
                          reporter of this Hadith: "Did you hear it yourself from Abu Hurairah?" When 6e
                          replied in the affirmative, Imam Zain al-`Abedin called out his most valuable
                          slave and set him free there and then. According to Muslim, he had an offer
                          often thousand dirhams for the slave. On the basis of this verse, Imam Abu
                          Hanifah and Imam Sha`bi have ruled: "Setting a slave free is superior to giving
                          away charity, for Allah has mentioned it before the mention of charity.<br><br>
                          The Holy Prophet has mentioned the merits of rendering help to the needy in many
                          ahadith, one of which is this Hadith from Hadrat Abu Hurairah: "The Holy Prophet
                          said: The one who strives in the cause of rendering help to the widow and the
                          needy is like the one who endeavors and strives in the cause of jihad for the
                          sake of Allah. (And Hadrat Abu Hurairah says :) I think that the Holy Prophet
                          also said: He is even like him who keeps standing up in the Prayer constantly,
                          without ever taking rest, and like him who observes the fast continuously
                          without ever breaking it:" (Bukhari, Muslim).<br><br>As for the orphans, there
                          are numerous sayings reported from the Holy Prophet. Hadrat Sahl bin Sa`d has
                          reported: "The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: I and the one who
                          supports a nearly related of un-related orphan, shall stand in Paradise like
                          this-saying this he raised his index finger and the middle finger, keeping them
                          a little apart." (Bukhari). Hadrat Abu HIurairah has reported this saying of the
                          Holy Prophet: "The best among the Muslim homes is the home wherein an orphan is
                          treated well and the worst the one wherein an orphan is mistreated." (Ibn Majah,
                          Bukhari in Al-Adab al- Mufrad). Hadrat Abu Umamah says that the Holy Prophet
                          said: "The one who passed his hand on the head of an orphan, only for the sake
                          of Allah, will have as many acts of virtue recorded in his favour as the number
                          of the hair on which his hand passed, and the one who treated an orphan boy or
                          girl well. will stand in Paradise with me like this...saying this the Holy
                          Prophet joined his two fingers together." (Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi). Ibn 'Abbas
                          says: The Holy Prophet said: "The one who made an orphan join him in eating and
                          drinking, Allah will make Paradise obligatory for him unless he commits a sin
                          which cannot be forgiven." (Sharh as-Sunnah).Hadrat Abu Hurairah says: A man
                          complained before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), saying: "I am
                          hard-hearted." The Holy Prophet said to him: "Treat the orphan with kindness and
                          love and feed the needy one." (Musnad Ahmad). <br><br>13That is, "In addition to
                          these qualities it is essential that one should be a believer, for without faith
                          no act is an act of virtue, nor acceptable in the sight of Allah. At numerous
                          places in the Qur'an it has been stated that only such an act of virtue is
                          appreciable and becomes a means of salvation as is accompanied by faith. In
                          .Surah An-Nisa', for example, it has been said: "The one who does good deeds,
                          whether man or woman, provided that the one is a believer, will enter Paradise
                          (v. 1245.)" In Surah An-Nahl: "Whosoever does righteous deeds, whether male or
                          female, provided that he is a believer, We shall surely grant him to live a pure
                          life in this world, and We will reward such people (in the Hereafter) according
                          to their best deeds" (v. 97). In Surah Al-Mu'min: "Whoever does good, whether
                          man or woman, provided that he is a believer, all such people shall enter
                          Paradise wherein they shall be provided without measure." (v : 4U). Whoever
                          studies the Qur'an, will see that in this Book wherever the good reward of a
                          righteous act has been mentioned, it has always been made conditional upon the
                          faith, a good act without faith; has nowhere been regarded as acceptable to God,
                          nor has any hope been given for a reward for it.<br><br>Here, the following
                          important point also should not remain hidden from view: In this verse it has
                          not been said: "Then he believed", but: "Then he joined those who believed.'
                          This means that mere believing as an individual and remaining content with it is
                          not what is desired; what is desired is that every new believer should join
                          those who have already believed so as to form a party of the believers, to bring
                          about a believing society, which should work for establishing the virtues and
                          wiping out the vices as demanded by the faith. <br><br>14These are two of the
                          important characteristics of the believing society, which have been expressed in
                          two brief sentences. The first characteristic is that its members should exhort
                          one another to patience, and the second that they should exhort one another to
                          compassion and mercy.<br><br>As for patience, we have explained at many places
                          that in view of the extensive meaning in which the Qur'an has used this word,
                          the entire life of a believer is a life of patience. As soon as a man stops on
                          to the path of the faith, test of his patience starts. Patience is required to
                          be exercised in performing the acts of worship enjoined by Allah patience is
                          needed in carrying out the commands of Allah; abstention from the things
                          forbidden by Allah is not possible without patience; patience is needed in
                          abandoning the moral evils and in adopting the pure morals; temptations to sin
                          faced at every step can be resisted only by recourse to patience. On countless
                          occasions in life obedience to God's law entails losses, troubles, hardships and
                          deprivations, and disobedience to the law seems to bring benefits and pleasures.
                          Without patience no believer can fare well on such occasions. Then, as soon as a
                          believer has adopted the way of the faith, he has to meet with resistance not
                          only from his own self and personal desires but also from his children, family,
                          society, country and nation and from the base-hearted among men and jinn of the
                          entire world; so much so that he is even required to abandon his country and
                          undertake Jihad in the cause of God. Under all these conditions only the quality
                          of patience can cause a man to remain steadfast to principles. Now, obviously,
                          if every believer individually was put to such a hard test, he would be faced
                          with the danger of defeat at every step and world hardly be able to pass through
                          the test successfully. On the contrary, if there existed a believing society
                          every member of which was not only himself possessed of patience but all its
                          members also were .supporting one another mutually in the test of patience,
                          successes would fall to its lot, a tremendous power would be generated to face
                          the evil, a mighty force of good individuals would be ready to help bring the
                          entire society on to the path of virtue and righteousness.<br><br>As for mercy
                          and compassion, it is the distinctive feature of the society of believers that
                          they are not a hard-hearted, merciless and unjust people but a society whose
                          members are merciful and compassionate. to humanity at large and sympathetic and
                          friendly among themselves. A believer as an individual is an embodiment of
                          Allah's quality of mercy and the group of the believers as a party also is a
                          representative of Allah's Messenger, who has been described thus: "O Muhammad,
                          We have sent you to be a real blessing for the people of the world." (AI-Anbiya':
                          107). The highest moral quality which the Holy Messenger (upon whom be Allah's
                          peace) tried his utmost to inculcate among his followers was this very quality
                          of mercy. Consider - the following of his sayings, which show what importance he
                          attached to it. Hadrat Jarir bin `Abdullah says that the Holy Messenger (upon
                          whom be peace) said: "Allah does not show mercy to him who does not show mercy
                          to others." (Bukhari, Muslim).<br><br>Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin al-`As says
                          that the holy Prophet said: "The Rahman (Merciful) shows mercy to those who show
                          mercy (to others). Show mercy to those who live in the earth, the One who is in
                          heaven will show mercy to you." (Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi).<br><br>Hadrat Abu Sa`id
                          Khudri has reported that the Holy Prophet said: "The one who does not show
                          mercy, is not shown mercy. " (Bukhari in Al-Adab al-Mufrad). Ibn `Abbas says
                          that the Holy Prophet said: "The one who does not treat our young ones
                          mercifully and does not treat our elderly ones respectfully, dces not belong to
                          us. " (TirmidhI).<br><br>Abu Da'ud has related this same saying of the Holy
                          Prophet on the authority of Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr, thus: "The one who did
                          not feel pity on our young and did not respect our elderly does not belong to
                          us."<br><br>Hadrat Abu Hurairah says: "I have heard Abul-Qasim, the Truthful
                          (upon whom be peace), say: "The heart of the wretched one is deprived of the
                          quality of mercy altogether' . " (Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi).<br><br>Hadrat `Iyad
                          bin Humad relates that the Holy Prophet said: "Three kinds of men belong to
                          Paradise, one of whom is the person who is kindly and compassionate to every
                          relative and every Muslim." (Muslim).<br><br>Hadrat Nu`man bin Bashir has
                          reported that the Holy Prophet said: "You will find the believers like a body in
                          the matter of mutual kindness, love and sympathy, so that if one part of the
                          body suffers the whole body suffers and becomes restless because of it." (Bukhari,
                          Muslim).<br><br>Hadrat Abu Musa Al-ash`ari says that the Holy Prophet said: "The
                          believer is for the other believer like a wall each part of which supports and
                          strengthens the other part." (Bukhari, Muslim).<br><br>Hadrat `Abdullah bin
                          'Umar has reported that the Holy Prophet said: "A Muslim is a brother of the
                          other Muslim: neither treats him unjustly, nor withholds his help from him. The
                          person who works to fulfill a need of his brother, Allah will seek to fulfill
                          his need; and the one who rescues a Muslim from an affliction, Allah will rescue
                          him from an affliction of the afflictions of the Resurrection Day; and the one
                          who conceals the fault of a Muslim, Allah will conceal his fault on the
                          Resurrection Day. " (Bukhari, Muslim).<br><br>These traditions indicate what
                          kind of a society is envisaged by the Qur'anic instruction given in this verse,
                          which exhorts the righteous people to join the group of the believers after they
                          have affirmed the faith. <br><br>15For an explanation of "the people of the
                          right hand and of the left hand", see E.N.'s 5, 6 of Surah Al-Waqi'ah.<br><br>
                          16That is, fire will be so covering them from every side that they will find no
                        way of escape from it.<br></p>
