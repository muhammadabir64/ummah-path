                          angels who take the soul at deaths and those who hasten to carryout Allah's
                          Commands, and those who conduct the affairs of the universe according to Divine
                          Will, to assure that the Resurrection will certainly come to pass and the second
                          life after death will certainly take place. For the angels who are employed to
                          pluck out the soul today can also be employed to restore the soul tomorrow, and
                          the angels who promptly execute Allah's Commands and conduct the affairs of the
                          universe today can also upset the order of the universe tomorrow by orders of
                          the same God and can also bring about a new order.<br><br>After this the people
                          have been told, so as to say: "This work which you regard as absolutely
                          impossible, is not any difficult for Allah, for which He may have to make
                          lengthy preparations. Just a single jolt will upset this system of the world and
                          a second jolt will be enough to cause you to appear as living beings in the new
                          world. At that time the same people who were wont to deny it, would be trembling
                          with fear and seeing with awe struck eyes all that they thought was impossible.<br>
                          <br>Then, relating the story of the Prophet Moses and Pharaoh briefly, the
                          people have been warned to the effect: "You know full well what fate the Pharaoh
                          met in consequence of belying the Messenger and rejecting the guidance brought
                          by him and endeavoring to defeat his mission by trickery and deceit. If you do
                          not learn any lesson from it and do not change your ways and attitude
                          accordingly, you also will have to meet the same fate.<br><br>Then, in vv.
                          27-13, arguments have been given for the Hereafter and life after death. In this
                          regard, the deniers have been asked the question:"Is your resurrection a more
                          difficult task or the creation of the huge Universe which spreads around you to
                          infinite distances with myriads of its stars and planets? Your recreation cannot
                          be difficult for the God for Whom this was an easy task. Thus, after presenting
                          in a single sentence, a decisive argument for the possibility of the Hereafter,
                          attention has been drawn to the earth and its provisions that have been arranged
                          in it for the sustenance of man and animal and of which everything testifies
                          that it has been created with great wisdom for fulfilling some special purpose.
                          Pointing to this the question has been left for the intellect of man to ponder
                          for itself and form the opinion whether calling man to account after having
                          delegated authority and responsibilities to a creature like him in this wise
                          system would be more in keeping with the demands of wisdom, or that he should
                          die after committing all sorts of misdeeds in the world and should perish and
                          mix in the dust for ever and should never be called to account as to how he
                          employed the authority and fulfilled the responsibilities entrusted to him.
                          Instead of discussing this question, in vv. 34-41, it has been said: "When the
                          Hereafter is established, men's eternal future will be determined on the
                          criterion as to which of them rebelled against his God transgressing the bounds
                          of service and made the material benefits and pleasures his objective of life
                          and which of them feared standing before his Lord and refrained from fulfilling
                          the unlawful desires of the self." This by itself provides the right answer to
                          the above question to every such person who considers it honestly, free from
                          stubbornness. For the only rational, logical and moral demand of giving
                          authority and entrusting responsibilities to man in the world is that he should
                          be called to account on this very basis ultimately and rewarded or punished
                          accordingly.<br><br>In conclusion, the question of the disbelievers of Makkah as
                          to when Resurrection will take place, has been answered. They asked the Holy
                          Prophet this question over and over again. In reply it has been said that the
                          knowledge of the time of its occurrence rests with Allah alone. The Messenger is
                          there only to give the warning that it will certainly come. Now whoever wishes
                          may mend his ways, fearing its coming, and whoever wishes may behave and conduct
                          himself as he likes, fearless of its coming. When the appointed time comes,
                          those very people who loved the life of this world and regarded its pleasures as
                          the only object of life, would feel that they had stayed in the world only for
                          an hour or so. Then they will realize how utterly they had ruined their future
                        for ever for the sake of the short lived pleasures of the world.<br></p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><br>Here, the object for which an oath has been sworn by beings having five
                          qualities has not been mentioned; but the theme that follows by itself leads to
                          the conclusion that the oath has been sworn to affirm that the Resurrection is a
                          certainty, which must come to pass, when all dead men shall be resurrected. Nor
                          is there any mention as to what are the beings possessed of the qualities.
                          However, a large number of the Companions and their immediate successors and
                          most of the commentators have expressed the opinion that they are the angels.
                          Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Masruq, Sa`id bin
                          Jubair, Abu salih Abud-Duha and Suddi; say that "those who pluck out from the
                          depths and those who draw out gently" imply the angels, who wrench out the soul
                          of man at death from the very depths of his body, from its every fiber. "Those
                          who glide about swiftly", according to Hadrat Ibn Mas`ud, Mujahid, Sa`id bin
                          Jubair and Abu Salih, also imply the angels, who hurry about swiftly in
                          execution of Divine Commands as though they were gliding through space. The same
                          meaning of "those who hasten out as in a race" has been taken by Hadrat `Ali,
                          Mujahid, Masruq, Abu Salih and Hasan Bari, and hastening out implies that each
                          one of them hurries on his errand as soon as he receives the first indication of
                          Divine Will. "Those who conduct the affairs" also imply the angels as has been
                          reported from Hadrat `Ali, Mujahid, 'Ata' Abu -Salih, Hasan Bari;, Qatadah,
                          Rabi` bin Anas and Suddi. In other words, these are the workers of the Kingdom
                          of the Universe, who are conducting all the affairs of the world in accordance
                          with Allah's Command and Will. Though this meaning of these verses has not been
                          reported in any authentic Hadith from the Holy Prophet, while this meaning has
                          been given by some major Companions and their immediate successors and pupils,
                          one is led to form the view that they must have obtained this knowledge from the
                          Holy Prophet himself.<br><br>Now the question arises: On what basis has the oath
                          been sworn by these angels for the occurrence of the Resurrection and life after
                          death when they themselves are as imperceptible as the thing for the occurrence
                          of which they have been presented as an evidence and as an argument. In our
                          opinion the reason is (and Allah has the best knowledge) that the Arabs were not
                          deniers of the existence of the angels. They themselves admitted that at the
                          death the soul was taken out by the angels; they also believed that the angels
                          moved at tremendous speeds; they could reach any place between the earth and the
                          heavens instantly and promptly execute any errand that was entrusted to them.
                          They also acknowledged that the angels are subordinate to Divine Will and they
                          conduct the affairs of the universe strictly and precisely in accordance with
                          Divine Will; they are not independent and masters of their will. They regarded
                          them as daughters of Allah out of ignorance and worshiped them as deities, but
                          they did not believe that they possessed the real authority as well. Therefore,
                          the basis of the reasoning from the above mentioned attributes for the
                          occurrence of the Resurrection and life after death is that the angels who took
                          the soul by the order of God, could also restore the soul by the order of the
                          same God; and the angels who conducted the affairs of the universe by the order
                          of God could also upset this universe by the order of the same God whenever . He
                          so ordered them and could also bring about a new world order. They would not
                          show any negligence or delay in the execution of His Command. <br><br>2The first
                          jolt implies the jolt which will destroy the earth and everything on it, and the
                          second jolt at which all dead men will rise up from death and from their graves.
                          This same state has been described in Surah Az-Zumar, thus: "And when the
                          Trumpet shall be blown on that Day, all those who are in the heavens and the
                          earth shall fall down dead except those whom Allah may allow (to live). Then the
                          Trumpet shall be blown again and they will all stand up, looking around." (v.
                          68)<br><br>3"Some hearts", because, according to the Qur'an, only the
                          disbelievers, the wicked people and the hypocrites will be terror-stricken on
                          the Resurrection Day, the righteous believers will remain secure from this
                          tenor. About them in Surah Al-Anbiya' it has been said: "The time of great
                          fright will not trouble them at all; the angels will rush. forth to receive
                          them, saying: `This is the very Day which you were promised'." (v. 103) <br><br>
                          4That is, when they were told that they would surely be raised back to life
                          after death, they started mocking it, saying to one another, "Well, if we have
                          really to be restored to our former state of life, then we would certainly be
                          doomed. "<br><br>5That is, "They are mocking it as an impossibility, whereas it
                          is not at all a difficult task for Allah for the performance of which He may
                          have to make lengthy preparations. For it only a single shout or cry is enough
                          at which your dust of ash will gather together from wherever it lay, and you
                          will suddenly find yourself alive on the back of the earth. Thinking this return
                          to be a return to loss, you may try to escape from it however hard you may, but
                          it will inevitably take place; it cannot be averted by your denial, escape or
                          mockery."<br><br>6As the denial of the Resurrection and Hereafter by the
                          disbelievers of Makkah and their mockery of it was not, in fact, rejection of a
                          philosophy but belying Allah's Messengers, and the tricks that they were
                          employing against the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) were not against
                          an ordinary man but were meant to frustrate the mission of Allah's Messenger,
                          the story of the Prophet Moses and the Pharaoh is being related before giving
                          additional arguments for the occurrence of the Hereafter so that they are warned
                          of the consequences of fighting with the Messenger and resisting the God Who
                          sent him. <br><br>7According to general opinion among the commentators "the
                          sacred . valley of 'Tuwa" means "the sacred valley which was named Tuwa". But,
                          besides this, two other meanings of it also have been given:<br><br>(1) "The
                          valley that was blessed and made sacred twice" . for it was first made sacred
                          when Allah spoke to Moses in it for the first time, and it was blessed and made
                          sacred for the second time when the Prophet Moses led the children of Israel out
                          of Egypt and brought them into it; and<br><br>(2) "called out to him in the
                          sacred valley in the night," and this is according to the meaning of tuwa in the
                          Arabic idiom. <br><br>8Here, one should understand a few things well:<br><br>(1)
                          The dialogue that took place between the Prophet Moses and Allah Almighty at the
                          time of appointing him to the office of Prophethood has been related at some
                          places briefly and at others in full detail in the Qur'an as the occasion
                          demanded. Here; brevity was the need; therefore, only a resume has been given.
                          Fuller details are found in Ta Ha: 9-48, Ash-Shua`ra': 10-17, An Naml: 7-12, AI-Qasas:
                          29-35.<br><br>(2) The rebellion of the Pharaoh referred to here relates to his
                          transgressing the bounds of service and rebelling both against the Creator and
                          against His creatures. As for his rebellion against the Creator, it is being
                          mentioned a little below when he gathered his people together and prolaimed: "I
                          am your lord, the supreme." As against the creatures his rebellion was that he
                          had divided his subjects into classes; he treated the weak classes tyrannically
                          and had reduced his entire nation to slavery as has been mentioned in Al-Qasas:
                          4 and Az-Zukhruf: 54.<br><br>(3) The instruction given to Moses was: "Go, you
                          and your brother Aaron, to Pharaoh for he has transgressed all bounds. Talk to
                          him gently; maybe that he is convinced by admonition or is imbued with fear."
                          (Ta Ha: 44). One model of the gentle speech has been given in these verses,
                          which shows what right method a preacher should adopt when preaching to a
                          perverted man. Other models are given in Ta Ha: 49-52, Ash-Shua`ra': 23-28, and
                          Al-Qasas: 37. These verses are of those in which Allah has taught the correct
                          methods of preaching Islam in the Qur'an.<br><br>(4) The Prophet Moses had not
                          been sent to Pharaoh only for the deliverance of the children of Israel as some
                          people seem to think but the primary object of his appointment was to show
                          Pharaoh and his people the right way, and the second object was that if he did
                          not accept the right way, the children of Israel (who in fact were a Muslim
                          people) should be taken out of his slavery and from Egypt. This thing becomes
                          plain from these verses too, for there is no mention whatever in these of the
                          deliverance of the children of Israel, but the Prophet Moses has been commanded
                          to present the message of the Truth before Pharaoh, and this is confirmed by
                          those verses also in which the Prophet Moses has preached Islam as well as
                          demanded freedom of the children of Israel, e.g. see Al-A`raf 104-105, Ta Ha:
                          47-52, Ash-Shua ara': 16-17, 23-28. (For further explanation, see E.N. 74 of
                          Yunus).<br><br>(5) Here, "to adopt purity" means to adopt purity of belief,
                          morals and deeds, or, in other words, to accept Islam. Ibn Zaid says: "Wherever
                          in the Qur'an the word tazakka (purity) has been use, it implies acceptance of
                          Islam." As an example of this he has cited the following three verses: "And this
                          is the reward of him who adopts purity", i.e. accepts Islam; "and what would
                          make you know that he might adopt purity", i.e. becomes a Muslim (`Abasa:3);
                          "And you would not be responsible if he did not adapt purity", i.e. did not
                          become a Muslim (`Abasa: 7). (Ibn Jarir).<br><br>(6) "That I may guide you to
                          your Lord so that you may have fear (of Him)" means: "When you recognize your
                          Lord and come to know that you are His slave, and not a free man, you will
                          inevitably have fear of Him in your heart, for fear of God is the thing on which
                          depends the right attitude of man in the world. Without the knowledge and fear
                          of God no purity of the self can be possible."<br><br>9"The great Sign" : the
                          turning of the staff into a serpent, as has been mentioned at several places in
                          the Qur'an. Obviously there could be no greater sign than that a lifeless staff
                          should turn into a living serpent right in front of the eyes of the people, that
                          it should devour the artificial serpents produced by the magicians out of their
                          staffs and cords, and when the Prophet Moses should pick it up, it should become
                          a walking stick again. This was proof that it was Allah, Lord of the worlds, Who
                          had sent Moses as a Prophet. <br><br>10According to the details given at other
                          places in the Qur'an, he summoned skillful magicians from all over Egypt and
                          made them produce serpents out of sticks and cords in front of the assembled
                          people so that they were convinced that Moses (peace be upon him was not a
                          Prophet but a magician, and that the miracle worked by him of turning a staff
                          into a serpent, could also be worked by other magicians. But this device of his
                          recoiled upon himself and the defeated magicians themselves admitted that what
                          Moses (peace be on him) had displayed was no magic but a miracle. <br><br>11This
                          proclamation of Pharaoh has been mentioned at several places in the Qur'an. On
                          one occasion he said to the Prophet Moses: "If you took another one as a deity
                          beside me, I would cast you in the prison." (Ash-Shua`ra': 29). On another
                          occasion he had addressed his courtiers, saying: "O chiefs, I do not know of any
                          other god of yours than myself. (Al-Qasas.: 38). By this Pharaoh did not mean,
                          nor could he ever mean, that he himself was the creator of the universe and he
                          had made the world, nor that he denied the existence of Allah and claimed to be
                          lord of the universe, nor that he regarded only himself as a deity of the people
                          in the religious sense. In the Qur'an itself there is a clear testimony that as
                          regards religion he himself worshiped other gods. Once his courtiers said to
                          him: "Will you leave Moses and his people free to spread chaos in the land, and
                          let them discard you and your deities?" (Al A`raf: 127). And in the Qur'an
                          itself this saying of the Pharaoh also has been cited: "Had Moses been sent by
                          Allah, why were not bracelets of gold sent down to him, or a company of angels
                          as attendants?" (AzZukhruf: 53). Thus, in fact, he called himself a god and
                          supreme deity not in the religious but in the political sense. What he meant was
                          that he possessed the sovereign rights: no one beside him had the right to rule
                          in his kingdom and there was no superior power whose orders could be enforced in
                          the land. (For further explanation. see E.N. 85 of Al-A`raf, E.N. 21 of Ta Ha,
                          E.N.'s 24, 26 of Ash Shua'ra', E-N.'s 52, 53 of Al-Qasas E.N. 49 of Az-Zukhruf).<br>
                          <br>12"...who fears": who fears the consequences of denying God's Messenger,
                          which the Pharaoh experienced in the past.<br><br>13Now arguments are being
                          given for the possibility of Resurrection and life after death and their being
                          the very demand and requirement of wisdom. <br><br>14Here, creation implies the
                          recreation of men, and the heaven the entire firmament which contains countless
                          stars and planets, and innumerable solar systems and galaxies. means to say:
                          "You think that your resurrection after death is something extremely improbable
                          and you express wonder saying: `How is it possible that when our very bones will
                          have decayed and become rotten the scattered particles of our bodies will be
                          reassembled and made living once again?' But have you ever also considered
                          whether the great universe is harder to create or your own re-creation in the
                          form in which you were created in the first instance? The God Who created you in
                          the first instance cannot be powerless to create you once again." This same
                          argument for life after death has been given at several places in the Qur'an.
                          For example, in Surah Ya Sin it has been said: "Is not He Who created the
                          heavens and the earth able to create the like of them (again)? Why not, when He
                          is the skillful Creator." (v. 81) And in Surah Al-Mu'min it was said: "Surely
                          the creation of the heavens and the earth is a greater task than the creation of
                          man, but most people do not know. (v. 57) <br><br>15The night and the day have
                          been attributed to the heaven, for the night falls when the sun of the heavens
                          sets and the day dawns when it rises. The word "cover" has been used for the
                          night in the sense that after the sun has set the darkness of the night so
                          spreads over the earth as though it has covered it from above by a curtain. <br>
                          <br>16"After that He spread out the earth" does not mean that Allah created the
                          earth after the creation of the heavens, but it is a style of expression just
                          like our saying after making mention of something: "Then this is noteworthy."
                          The object is not to express the sequence of occurrence between the two things
                          but to draw attention from the first to the second thing although both may exist
                          together. Several instances of this style are found in the Qur'an, e.g. in Surah
                          Al-Qalam it is said: "(He is) oppressive, and after that, ignoble by birth."
                          This does not mean that first he became oppressive and then he turned ignoble by
                          birth, but it means: "He is oppressive, and above all, ignoble by birth."
                          Likewise, in Surah Al-Balad it is said: "Should free a slave...then be of those
                          who believe." This also does not mean that first he should act righteously and
                          then believe. but that along with doing righteous deeds he should also be
                          characterized by belief. Here, one should also understand that at some places in
                          the Qur'an the creation of the earth has been mentioned first and then the
                          creation of the heavens, as in Al-Baqarah: 29, and at others the creation of the
                          heavens has been mentioned first and then of the earth, as in these verses.
                          There is, in fact, no contradiction in this. At no place the object is to tell
                          what was created first and what afterwards, but wherever the context requires
                          that the excellences of the power of Allah be made prominent, the heavens have
                          been mentioned first and then the earth, and where the context requires that the
                          people be made to appreciate and acknowledge the blessings that they are
                          benefiting by on the earth, the mention of the earth has been made before that
                          of the heavens. (For further explanation, see E.N's 13,14 of Ha Mim As-Sajdah).
                          <br><br>17"Pasture" here does not only imply pasture and fodder for the animals
                          but all kinds of herbal produce suitable for consumption both by man and by
                          animal. An example of the use of rat'. which is generally used in Arabic for the
                          grazing animals, is found in Surah Yusuf: 12, signifying that this word is
                          sometimes used for man also. The brothers of Joseph said to their father: "Send
                          Joseph with us tomorrow that he may freely graze and enjoy sport. " Here, the
                          word grace (rat`) for the child has been used in the meaning that he may move
                          about freely in the jungle and pluck and eat fruit. <br><br>18In these verses
                          arguments have been given for the Resurrection and life after death from two
                          aspects: first, that it is not at all difficult to establish these for the power
                          of that God Who has made this vast and huge universe with such wonderful balance
                          and this earth with such provisions. Second, that the pointers to the perfect
                          wisdom of Allah which are clearly visible in the universe and the earth, point
                          out that nothing is happening here purposelessly. The balance that exists
                          between countless of the stars and planets and galaxies in the heavens testifies
                          that all this has not happened haphazardly but there is a well thought-out plan
                          working behind it. The regular alternation of the night and day is an evidence
                          that this system has been established with supreme wisdom and knowledge for
                          making the earth a home and place of settlement. On this very earth are found
                          regions where the alternation of the night and day takes place within 24 hours
                          and also those regions where there are longer days and longer nights. A very
                          large part of the earth's population lives in the first kind of the regions.
                          Then as the days and nights go on becoming longer and longer, life goes on
                          becoming harder and harder and population thinner and thinner. So much so that
                          the regions where there are six-month-long days and six-month-long nights, are
                          not at all fit for human settlement. Arranging both these types of the land on
                          this very earth Allah has provided the evidence that this regular order of the
                          alternation of night and day has not come about accidentally but has been
                          brought about with great wisdom precisely in accordance with a scheme to make
                          the earth a place fit for human settlement. Likewise, spreading out the earth so
                          that it becomes a fit place to live in, providing in it that water which should
                          be palatable for man and animal and a cause of growth for vegetation, setting in
                          it mountains and creating all those things which may become a means of life for
                          both man and animal- all these are a manifest sign that they are not chance
                          happenings of the purposeless works of a care-free person but each one of these
                          has been arranged purposefully by a Supreme, Wise Being. Now every sensible and
                          intelligent man can consider for himself whether the necessity and occurrence of
                          the Hereafter is the requirement of wisdom or its negation. The person who in
                          spite of seeing all this says that there is no Hereafter, in fact, says that
                          everything in the universe is happening wisely and purposefully, but only the
                          creation of man on the earth as a being endowed with sense and power is
                          meaningless and foolish. For there could be nothing more purposeless than
                          delegating to man vast powers of appropriation in the earth and providing him an
                          opportunity to do good as well as evil deeds but then failing to ever subject
                          him to accountability. <br><br>19This implies the Resurrection for which the
                          words at-Taammat alkubra have been used. Taammah by itself is a grievous
                          calamity which afflicts everybody. Then it has been further qualified by the
                          word kubra (great), which shows that the mere word taammah is not enough to
                          describe fully its intensity and severity. <br><br>20That is, "When man will see
                          that the same Day of accountability of which he was being foretold in the world,
                          has come, he will start remembering each one of his misdeeds done in the world
                          even before his records are handed over to him. Some people experience this even
                          in the world. if at some time they come across a dangerous situation suddenly
                          when death seems to be staring them in the face, their whole life-film flashes
                          across their mind's eye all at once. <br><br>21Here, in a few words, it has been
                          told briefly what shall be the criterion of the final judgment in the Hereafter.
                          One kind of the conduct of life in the world is that transgressing all bounds of
                          service man should rebel against his God and should make up his mind that he
                          would seek only the benefits and pleasures of this world in whatever way they
                          could be sought and achieved. The other kind of conduct is that while man passes
                          life in the world he should constantly keep in view the truth that ultimately
                          one day he has to stand before his Lord, and should refrain from fulfilling the
                          evil desires of the self only for the fear that if he earned an unlawful benefit
                          in obedience to his self, or enjoyed an evil pleasure, what answer he would give
                          to his Lord. The criterion of the judgment in the Hereafter will be which of the
                          two kinds of conduct he adopted in the world. If he had adopted the first kind
                          of conduct, his permanent abode would be Hell, and if he had adopted the second
                          kind of conduct, his permanent home would be Paradise. <br><br>22The
                          disbelievers of Makkah asked this question of the Holy Prophet over and over
                          again. By this they did not mean to know the time and date of the coming of
                          Resurrection but to mock it. (For further explanation, see E.N. 35 of Surah Al-Mulk).<br>
                          <br>23This also we have explained in E.N. 36 of Surah Al-Mulk above. As for the
                          words "you are only a Warner to him who fears it", they do not mean that it is
                          not your duty to warn those who do not fear, but it means: "Your warning will
                          benefit only him who fears the coming of that Day."<br><br>24This theme has
                          occurred at several places in the Qur'an and been explained in the corresponding
                          Notes. For it, see E.N. 53 of Yunus, E.N. 56 of Bani Isra'il, E.N. 80 of Ta Ha,
                          E.N. 101 of Al-Mu'minun, E.N.'s 81, 82 of ArRum, E.N. 48 of Ya Sin. Besides,
                          this theme has also occurred in Al-Ahqaf: 35 but we have not explained it there
                        for fear of repetition.<br></p>
