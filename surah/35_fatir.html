                  <li class="collection-item"> Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels, messengers with wings,- two, or three, or four (pairs): He adds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> What Allah out of his Mercy doth bestow on mankind there is none can withhold: what He doth withhold, there is none can grant, apart from Him: and He is the Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom.</li><li class="collection-item"> O men! Call to mind the grace of Allah unto you! is there a creator, other than Allah, to give you sustenance from heaven or earth? There is no god but He: how then are ye deluded away from the Truth?</li><li class="collection-item"> And if they reject thee, so were messengers rejected before thee: to Allah back for decision all affairs.</li><li class="collection-item"> O men! Certainly the promise of Allah is true. Let not then this present life deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver deceive you about Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> Verily Satan is an enemy to you: so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his adherents, that they may become Companions of the Blazing Fire.</li><li class="collection-item"> For those who reject Allah, is a terrible Penalty: but for those who believe and work righteous deeds, is Forgiveness, and a magnificent Reward.</li><li class="collection-item"> Is he, then, to whom the evil of his conduct is made alluring, so that he looks upon it as good, (equal to one who is rightly guided)? For Allah leaves to stray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. So let not thy soul go out in (vainly) sighing after them: for Allah knows well all that they do!</li><li class="collection-item"> It is Allah Who sends forth the Winds, so that they raise up the Clouds, and We drive them to a land that is dead, and revive the earth therewith after its death: even so (will be) the Resurrection!</li><li class="collection-item"> If any do seek for glory and power,- to Allah belong all glory and power. To Him mount up (all) Words of Purity: It is He Who exalts each Deed of Righteousness. Those that lay Plots of Evil,- for them is a Penalty terrible; and the plotting of such will be void (of result).</li><li class="collection-item"> And Allah did create you from dust; then from a sperm-drop; then He made you in pairs. And no female conceives, or lays down (her load), but with His knowledge. Nor is a man long-lived granted length of days, nor is a part cut off from his life, but is in a Decree (ordained). All this is easy to Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike,- the one palatable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, and the other, salt and bitter. Yet from each (kind of water) do ye eat flesh fresh and tender, and ye extract ornaments to wear; and thou seest the ships therein that plough the waves, that ye may seek (thus) of the Bounty of Allah that ye may be grateful.</li><li class="collection-item"> He merges Night into Day, and he merges Day into Night, and he has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law): each one runs its course for a term appointed. Such is Allah your Lord: to Him belongs all Dominion. And those whom ye invoke besides Him have not the least power.</li><li class="collection-item"> If ye invoke them, they will not listen to your call, and if they were to listen, they cannot answer your (prayer). On the Day of Judgment they will reject your "Partnership". and none, (O man!) can tell thee (the Truth) like the One Who is acquainted with all things.</li><li class="collection-item"> O ye men! It is ye that have need of Allah: but Allah is the One Free of all wants, worthy of all praise.</li><li class="collection-item"> If He so pleased, He could blot you out and bring in a New Creation.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor is that (at all) difficult for Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor can a bearer of burdens bear another´s burdens if one heavily laden should call another to (bear) his load. Not the least portion of it can be carried (by the other). Even though he be nearly related. Thou canst but admonish such as fear their Lord unseen and establish regular Prayer. And whoever purifies himself does so for the benefit of his own soul; and the destination (of all) is to Allah.</li><li class="collection-item"> The blind and the seeing are not alike;</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor are the depths of Darkness and the Light;</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor are the (chilly) shade and the (genial) heat of the sun:</li><li class="collection-item"> Nor are alike those that are living and those that are dead. Allah can make any that He wills to hear; but thou canst not make those to hear who are (buried) in graves.</li><li class="collection-item"> Thou art no other than a warner.</li><li class="collection-item"> Verily We have sent thee in truth, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner: and there never was a people, without a warner having lived among them (in the past).</li><li class="collection-item"> And if they reject thee, so did their predecessors, to whom came their messengers with Clear Signs, Books of dark prophecies, and the Book of Enlightenment.</li><li class="collection-item"> In the end did I punish those who rejected Faith: and how (terrible) was My rejection (of them)!</li><li class="collection-item"> Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky? With it We then bring out produce of various colours. And in the mountains are tracts white and red, of various shades of colour, and black intense in hue.</li><li class="collection-item"> And so amongst men and crawling creatures and cattle, are they of various colours. Those truly fear Allah, among His Servants, who have knowledge: for Allah is Exalted in Might, Oft-Forgiving.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those who rehearse the Book of Allah, establish regular Prayer, and spend (in Charity) out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope for a commerce that will never fail:</li><li class="collection-item"> For He will pay them their meed, nay, He will give them (even) more out of His Bounty: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (service).</li><li class="collection-item"> That which We have revealed to thee of the Book is the Truth,- confirming what was (revealed) before it: for Allah is assuredly- with respect to His Servants - well acquainted and Fully Observant.</li><li class="collection-item"> Then We have given the Book for inheritance to such of Our Servants as We have chosen: but there are among them some who wrong their own souls; some who follow a middle course; and some who are, by Allah´s leave, foremost in good deeds; that is the highest Grace.</li><li class="collection-item"> Gardens of Eternity will they enter: therein will they be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their garments there will be of silk.</li><li class="collection-item"> And they will say: "Praise be to Allah, Who has removed from us (all) sorrow: for our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving Ready to appreciate (service):</li><li class="collection-item"> "Who has, out of His Bounty, settled us in a Home that will last: no toil nor sense of weariness shall touch us therein."</li><li class="collection-item"> But those who reject (Allah) - for them will be the Fire of Hell: No term shall be determined for them, so they should die, nor shall its Penalty be lightened for them. Thus do We reward every ungrateful one!</li><li class="collection-item"> Therein will they cry aloud (for assistance): "Our Lord! Bring us out: we shall work righteousness, not the (deeds) we used to do!" - "Did We not give you long enough life so that he that would should receive admonition? and (moreover) the warner came to you. So taste ye (the fruits of your deeds): for the wrong-doers there is no helper."</li><li class="collection-item"> Verily Allah knows (all) the hidden things of the heavens and the earth: verily He has full knowledge of all that is in (men´s) hearts.</li><li class="collection-item"> He it is That has made you inheritors in the earth: if, then, any do reject (Allah), their rejection (works) against themselves: their rejection but adds to the odium for the Unbelievers in the sight of their Lord: their rejection but adds to (their own) undoing.</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "Have ye seen (these) ´Partners´ of yours whom ye call upon besides Allah? Show Me what it is they have created in the (wide) earth. Or have they a share in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book from which they (can derive) clear (evidence)?- Nay, the wrong-doers promise each other nothing but delusions.</li><li class="collection-item"> It is Allah Who sustains the heavens and the earth, lest they cease (to function): and if they should fail, there is none - not one - can sustain them thereafter: Verily He is Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.</li><li class="collection-item"> They swore their strongest oaths by Allah that if a warner came to them, they would follow his guidance better than any (other) of the Peoples: But when a warner came to them, it has only increased their flight (from righteousness),-</li><li class="collection-item"> On account of their arrogance in the land and their plotting of Evil, but the plotting of Evil will hem in only the authors thereof. Now are they but looking for the way the ancients were dealt with? But no change wilt thou find in Allah´s way (of dealing): no turning off wilt thou find in Allah´s way (of dealing).</li><li class="collection-item"> Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of those before them,- though they were superior to them in strength? Nor is Allah to be frustrated by anything whatever in the heavens or on earth: for He is All-Knowing. All-Powerful.</li><li class="collection-item"> If Allah were to punish men according to what they deserve. He would not leave on the back of the (earth) a single living creature: but He gives them respite for a stated Term: when their Term expires, verily Allah has in His sight all His Servants.</li>

<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>The word Fatir of the first very verse is the 
title given to this Surah, which simply means that it is a Surah in which the 
word Fatir has occurred. The other name is Al Malaika, which also occurs in the 
first verse.<br><br><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>The internal 
evidence of the style shows that the period of the revelation of this Sarah is 
probably the middle Makkan period, and especially that part of it, when 
antagonism had grown quite strong and every sort of mischief was being adopted 
to frustrate the mission of the Holy Prophet.<br><br><strong>Subject Matter and 
Theme</strong><br><br>The discourse is meant to warn and reprove the people of 
Makkah and their chiefs for their antagonistic attitude that they had then 
adopted towards the Holy Prophet's message of Tauhid, like a well wisher, and 
also to admonish them like a teacher, as if to say: "O foolish people, the way 
to which this Prophet is calling you is to your own advantage. Your anger, your 
tricks and machinations against it and your conspiracies and designs to 
frustrate it are not directed against him but against your own selves. If you do 
not listen to him, you will be harming your own selves, not him. Just consider 
and ponder over what he says : there is nothing wrong in it. He repudiates 
shirk. If you look around carefully, you will yourself realize that there is no 
basis for shirk in the world. He presents the doctrine of Tauhid. If you use 
your common sense, you will come to the conclusion that there is no being, 
beside Allah, Creator of the Universe, which might possess divine attributes and 
powers and authority. He tells you that you have not been created to be 
irresponsible in this world, but you have to render an account of your deeds 
before your God, and that there is life after the life of this world when 
everyone will meet the consequences of what he has done here. If you thing a 
little you will see that your doubts and your astonishment about it are 
absolutely baseless. Don't you see the phenomenon of the reproduction of 
creation day and night. How can then your own recreation be impossible for that 
God Who created you from an insignificant sperm drop? Doesn't your own intellect 
testify that the good and the evil cannot be alike? Then think and judge for 
yourselves as to what is reasonable, should the good and the evil meet with the 
same fate and end up in the dust, or should the good be requited with good and 
the evil with evil? Now, if you do not admit and acknowledge these rational and 
reasonable things and do not abandon your false gods, and wish to continue 
living only as irresponsible people in the world, the Prophet will not lose 
anything. It is you yourselves only who will suffer the consequences. The 
Prophet's only responsibility was to make the truth plain to you, which be has 
done."<br><br>In this connection, the Holy Prophet has been consoled again and 
again, as if to say :"When you are doing full justice to the preaching of your 
mission, you do not incur any responsibility for those who persist in their 
error and do not accept and follow the right way." Furthermore, he has also been 
consoled to the effect "You should neither grieve on account of those who do not 
want to believe, nor consume yourself with the thought of how to bring them to 
the rights path. Instead of this, you should pay your full attention to those 
who are inclined to listen to you."<br><br>The believers also, in this 
connection, have been given the good news so that they may feel strengthened and 
encouraged and remain steadfast on the path of the truth with full faith in the 
promises made by Allah.</p>
<hr>
<p>This can have two meanings:<br><br>(1) "That these angels perform the service 
of communicating messages between Allah and His Prophets :" and<br><br>(2) "that 
it is the duty of these angels to convey and enforce the Commands of Allah 
Almighty throughout the universe."<br><br>The object is to impress this truth: 
The position of the angels whom the polytheists have made their gods and 
goddesses is no more than of obedient servants of Allah, the One. Just as the 
servants of a king run about for the implementation of his orders, so do these 
angels fly about in the service of the real Sovereign of the Universe. These 
servants have no authority of their own; All powers rest with Allah, Who is the 
real Sovereign. <br><br>2We have no means to know what is the nature of the 
wings of these angels. But when Allah has used this word, which in human 
language is used for the wings of birds, instead of any other words, to express 
and depict the truth, one can certainly conclude that this very word of our 
language is nearest to the actual meaning. The mention of two and three and four 
pairs of the wings shows that different angels have been granted different 
degrees of powers by Allah. They have been equipped with different powers of 
speed and efficiency as demanded by the nature of service for which they arc 
employed. <br><br>3These words show that the number of the wings of the angels 
is restricted to four, but Allah has provided some angels with more wings than 
four. According to a Hadith related by Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, the Holy 
Prophet once saw the Angel Gabriel (peace be upon hits) with six hundred wings. 
(Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi). Hadrat 'A'ishah relates that the Holy Prophet had 
seen Gabriel twice in his real shape: he had six hundred wings and had covered 
the whole horizon. (Tirmidhi) <br><br>4This also is meant to remove the 
misunderstanding of the polytheists, who believed that from among the servants 
of Allah some one gave them the jobs, some one the children and some one health 
to their patients. All these superstitions of shirk are baseless, and the pure 
truth is just that whatever of mercy reaches the people, reaches them only 
through Allah Almighty's bounty and grace. No one else has the power either to 
bestow it or to withhold it. This theme has been expressed at many places in the 
Qur'an and the Ahadith in different ways so that man may avoid the humiliation 
of begging at every door and at every shrine and may realize that making or 
marring of his destiny .n the power of One Allah alone and of none else. <br>
<br>5He is the All-Mighty": He is dominant and the owner of Sovereignty: none 
can stop His judgments from being enforced. Also "He is All-Wise": every of His 
is based on wisdom. When He gives somebody something He because it is demanded 
by wisdom, and when He withholds something judgment gives it from somebody He 
withholds it because it would be against wisdom to give it. <br><br>
6"Remember.... you": "Do not be ungrateful: do not forget that whatever you have 
has been given by Allah". In other words, this sentence is meant to warn that 
whoever worships another than Allah, or regards a blessing as a favor done by 
another than Allah, or thanks another than Allah for a favor received, or prays 
to another than Allah for the grant of a blessing, is ungrateful". <br><br>
7There is a subtle gap between the first and the second sentence, which is being 
filled by the context itself. To understand this, one may visualize the scene 
like this: The polytheists are being addressed. The speaker asks the audience: 
'Is there another creator beside Allah, who might have created you, and might be 
arranging provisions for you from the earth and heavens ?" After this question 
the speaker waits for the answer. But there is no reply from anywhere. No one 
replies that there is another one beside Allah, who is their creator and 
sustainer. This by itself shows that the audience also believe that there is 
none beside Allah, who could be their creator and sustainer. Then the speaker 
says: "If so, then He alone can be the Deity also and no one else. How have you 
been so deceived ? Why have you taken these others as your deities, when Allah 
alone is your Creator and Sustainer?" <br><br>8"If they ...liar": `If they do 
not believe that there is no one worthy of worship but Allah, and accuse you of 
having made a false claim to Prophethood."<br><br>9That is, "It is not for the 
people to give the verdict that whomsoever they call a liar should in actual 
fact become a liar. The judgment rests with Allah. He shall in the end decide 
who was the liar, and shall bring the real liars to their evil end."<br><br>
10"The promise" implies the promise of the Hereafter to which allusion was made 
in the preceding sentence, saying: 'All affairs shall ultimately be presented 
before Allah. <br><br>11"Let not...deceive you": "Deceive you that the world is 
an end in itself: that there is no Hereafter when one will have to render an 
account of one's deeds: or that even if there is the Hereafter, the one who is 
enjoying life here will enjoy life there, too."<br><br>12"Great deceiver": 
Satan, as is evident from the next sentence. And "deceive you concerning Allah" 
means:<br><br>(1) That he should stake some people believe that Allah does not 
exist at All;<br><br>(2) involve others in the misunderstanding that Allah after 
having once created the world, has retired and has now practically nothing to do 
with the universe any more;<br><br>(3) delude others into believing that Allah 
no doubt is running the universe, but He has taken no responsibility of 
providing guidance to man: therefore, Revelation and Prophethood are a mere 
deception; and<br><br>(4) give still others the false hope that since Allah is 
All-Forgiving and All-Merciful. He will forgive one whatever sins one might have 
committed, and that He has some beloved ones too: if one remains attached to 
them, success and salvation are assured. <br><br>13Those who disbelieve : those 
who will refuse to believe in this invitation of Allah's Book and His Messenger.<br>
<br>14That is, Allah will overlook their errors and will reward them for their 
good deeds not merely with what they will just deserve but much more richly and 
generously. <br><br>15Verses 3-7 were addressed to the common people. In this 
paragraph mention has been made of the standard-bearers of error and deviation, 
who were exerting their utmost to frustrate and defeat the mission of the Holy 
Prophet. <br><br>16That is, one kind of perverted person is he who commits evil 
but knows and understands that he is committing evil. Such a person can be 
reformed by counsel and advice, and sometimes his own conscience also pricks and 
brings him to the right path, for his habits only are perverted, not his mind 
But there is another kind of a person whose mentality has been perverted, who 
has lost the discrimination between good and evil, far whom the life of sin has 
become alluring and lustrous, who abhors good and takes evil for civilization 
and culture, who regards goodness and piety as things of the past, and 
sinfulness and wickedness as progressiveness, and for whom guidance becomes 
error and error guidance. Such a person is not amenable to any advice, any 
admonition. He neither takes warning from his own follies, nor listens to a 
well-wisher. It is useless to waste ones tube and energy for the reformation of 
such a person Instead, the inviter to the truth should turn his attention 
towards those whose consciences may still be alive and who may still be inclined 
to listen to the truth. <br><br>17The insertion of the words "Allah lends astray 
whomsoever He pleases and shows the Right Way to whomsoever He pleases", between 
the preceding and this sentence, clearly gives the meaning that Allah deprives, 
of the grace of guidance, those who become so perverted mentally, and leaves 
them to wander aimlessly in the ways in which they themselves wish to remain 
lost. After making the Holy Prophet realize this fact Allah exhorts him to the 
effect: "It is not within your power to bring such people to the right path; 
therefore, have patience in their regard. Just as Allah is indifferent about 
them, so should you also avoid being unduly anxious about their reformation."<br>
<br>Here, one should bear in mind two things very clearly. First, the people 
being mentioned here were not the common people, but the chiefs of Makkah. who 
were employing every falsehood, every fraud and every trick to defeat the 
mission of the Holy Prophet. These people were in fact not involved in any 
misunderstanding about the Holy Prophet. They knew full well what he was calling 
theta to and what were the evils and moral weaknesses which they themselves were 
striving to maintain. After knowing and understanding All this they had firmly 
resolved not to let him succeed in his object, and for this purpose they did not 
feel any hesitation in using any mean or petty device. Now, evidently the people 
who deliberately and after annual consultation invent a new falsehood every next 
day and spread it against a person, can deceive the whole world but as for 
themselves they know that they are the liars and that the person whom they have 
accused is free of every blame. Then, if the person against whom the false 
propaganda is being made also does not react and respond in a way opposed to 
truth and righteousness, the unjust people also cannot help realizing that their 
opponent is a truthful and honest man. If in spite of this the people do not 
feel ashamed of their misconduct and continue to oppose and resist the truth 
with falsehood. their conduct itself testifies that they are under Allah's curse 
and they can no longer discriminate between good and evil.<br><br>Secondly, if 
Allah had only meant to make His Prophet understand the supreme truth, He could 
have secretly made him aware of this. There was no need to proclaim it openly in 
the Revelation. To mention it in the Qur'an and to proclaim it to the world was 
in fact meant to warn the common people that the leaders and the religious 
guides whom they were following blindly were the people of perverted mentality. 
whose mean conduct was itself an evidence that they were under the curse of 
Allah. <br><br>18This sentence in itself contains the threat that a time is 
coming when Allah will punish them for their misdeeds. When a ruler says that he 
is fully aware of the misdeeds of a culprit, it does not only mean that the 
ruler has the knowledge of his misconduct, but it necessarily contains the 
warning that he will also punish him for this certainly. <br><br>19That is, 
"These ignorant people think that the Hereafter is impossible. That is why they 
are living under the delusion that they may do whatever they like in the world, 
the time will never come when they will have to. appear before their God and 
render an account of their deeds. But this is no more than a delusion. On the 
Day of Resurrection, the dead men of all ages will suddenly rise back to life at 
one call of Allah just as the dead earth comes back to life at one shower of the 
rain and the roots, lying dead for ages, become green and start sprouting up 
from the layers of the earth." <br><br>20It should be noted that whatever the 
chiefs of the Quraish were doing against the Holy Prophet, they were doing it 
for the sake of their honor and dignity. They thought that if the Holy Prophet 
succeeded in his mission, their greatness and glory would fade away, their 
influence would die out and their honor among the Arabs would be ruined. At this 
it is being said: "The honor that you have attained for yourselves by your 
disbelief in and rebellion against Allah. is a false honor, which is destined to 
be mined. The taste and enduring honor, which can never suffer debasement, can 
be attained only through service of Allah. If you turn sincerely and faithfully 
to Him, you will attain it; and if you turn away from Him you are bound to live 
an abject, wretched life. " <br><br>21This is the real means of attaining the 
honor. In the sight of Allah the false, vicious and mischievous can never rise 
and flourish. In His sight only such a word can rise and flourish; which is 
taste and pure and based on the truth, and in which a righteous creed and a 
correct point of view may have been expressed and presented. Then the thing 
which makes the pure word rise and prosper is the action which conforms to it. 
Wherever the word is pure but the action opposed to it, the purity of the word 
suffers a blemish. The mere extravagant rise of the tongue does not exalt a 
word: the power of the righteous action is needed to exalt and raise it high.<br>
<br>Here. one should also note that the Qur'an presents the righteous word and 
the righteous action as inter-dependent. No action can be righteous merely on 
the basis of its external and apparent form unless it has a righteous creed 
behind it. And no righteous creed can be reliable unless it is supported and 
confirmed by a person's action. For instance, if a person says that he regards 
Allah, the One, alone as his Deity, but worships others than Allah in practical 
life, his action belies his word. If a person says that he regards the wine as 
unlawful but drinks, his mere word can neither be acceptable to the people nor 
deserve approval in the sight of Allah. <br><br>22Those who plot evil": Those 
who propagate false and evil words by means of cunning tricks, deceit and 
deceptive reasoning, and do not feel any hesitation in employing any device, 
however mean and depraved, to frustrate and defeat the word of the truth. "<br>
<br>23From here again the discourse is directed to the common people. <br><br>
24That is, man in the first instance was created from the dust directly, then 
his race was perpetuated through the sperm-drop. <br><br>25That is, "It is 
pre-ordained for everyone who is born in this world how long he will live. If a 
person lives a long life, he does so by Allah's decree, and if another one lives 
a short life, he too lives so by Allah's decree. Some ignorant people give the 
argument that in the past the death-rate of the newly-born children used to be 
high, and now it has been checked by the advancement of the medical science; and 
the people used to live short lives in the past, now due to better medical 
facilities the life-span has increased. But this argument could be presented in 
refutation of the Qur'anic argument only when it could be ascertained that 
Allah, for instance, had pre-ordained a two-year life for a certain person, and 
the modern medical facilities have enhanced it by a day. If a person has no such 
knowledge, he cannot refine this Qur'anic statement on any rational grounds. 
Only on the basis of the statistics that the death-rate among children has 
fallen, or that the people now. are living longer lives, it cannot be argued 
that man has now become able to change the decrees of Allah. Rationally it is 
not impossible that Allah might have fixed different life-spans for the people 
born in different periods, and this might also be Allah Almighty's decree that 
man in such and such an age would be granted curative power to treat such and 
such diseases, and in such and such a period man would be given greater means 
for longevity. <br><br>26That is, "It is not at all difficult for Allah to give 
commands and pass judgments about each individual of His countless creations 
when He possesses detailed and perfect knowledge about them." <br><br>27That is, 
the body of water in the oceans, and the body of water in the rivers and springs 
and lakes. <br><br>28"Fresh flesh": Flesh of water animals. <br><br>29That is 
pearls and corals and, in some rivers, diamonds and gold. <br><br>30That is, 
"The light of the day starts diminishing and the darkness of the night 
increasing gradually so as to cover up everything completely. Likewise, towards 
the end of the night, in the beginning, a streak of the light appears on the 
horizon, and then the bright day dawns." <br><br>31"Subjected .." : subjected to 
a law. <br><br>32The word qitmira in the original means the thin skin that 
covers the stone of the date-fruit; but what is meant to be said is that the 
gods of the mushriks do not own anything whatever. That is why we have 
translated it "a blade of grass", which is an insignificant thing.<br><br>33This 
does not mean that they cannot tell aloud, in answer to your prayer whether your 
prayer has been accepted or not, but it means that .they cannot take any action 
on your supplications. If a person sends his application to someone who is not a 
ruler. his application miscarries. For the person to whom it has been sent, has 
no authority whatever: he can neither reject it nor accept it. However, if the 
same application is sent to the one who is really a ruler, one or the other 
action will certainly be taken on it. <br><br>34That is, "They will plainly say: 
We had never told theta that we are Allah's associates and that they should 
worship us. On the contrary, we were not at All aware that they regarded us as 
Allah's associates and were invoking us for help. None of their prayers has 
reached us, nor has any of their gifts and offerings" . <br><br>35"All-Aware": 
Allah Almighty Himself. It means this: The other person can at the most refine 
shirk and prove the powerlessness of the gods of the polytheists by rational 
arguments only, but We are directly aware of the Absolute Truth. We are telling 
you, on the basis of knowledge, that All those whom the people believe to be 
possessing some powers in Our Godhead are absolutely powerless. They have no 
authority whatever by which they might do somebody good or harm. And We know 
this directly that on the Day of Resurrection, these gods of the mushriks will 
themselves refute their shirk. "<br><br>36That is, "You should not remain under 
the delusion that Allah stands in need of your help. If you do not accept Him as 
God, His Godhead will fail, and if you do not serve and worship Him, He will 
incur some loss. Nay, but the fact is that you stand in need of Him. You cannot 
remain alive for a moment if He does not keep you alive, and does not provide 
you with the means by which you remain alive in the world and function. 
Therefore, when you are told to adopt His service and obedience, it is not 
because Allah stands in need of it, but because upon it depends your own success 
here as well as in the Hereafter. If you do not do so, you will be harming your 
own selves only, and not Allah in any way." <br><br>37The word Ghani implies 
that He is the Owner of everything: He is Self-Sufficient and Independent of 
All: He does not stand in need of anyone's help. The word Hamid implies that He 
is Self-Praiseworthy: someone may praise Him, or may not, but He alone is worthy 
of hamd (praise and gratitude). These two attributes have been used together 
because one would be ghani even if one did not do any good to anyone by one's 
wealth. In such a case one would be ghani but not hamid One will be hamid only 
in case one does not draw any benefit for oneself but benefits others in every 
way from the treasures of one's wealth and resources. Since Allah is perfect in 
these two attributes, it has been said: "He is not just Ghani (self-sufficient) 
but such Ghani as is worthy of every kind of praise and gratitude, for He is 
fulfilling your needs as well as the needs of all other creatures.<br><br>38That 
is, You are not enjoying life on Allah's earth solely by dim of your own power 
and might. He has the power to remove you from here in no time and raise another 
people to take your place. Therefore, you should understand your true worth, and 
should desist from adopting the conduct which has been causing the downfall of 
the nations. When Allah wills to send someone to his doom. there is no one in 
the universe, who can stop Him and withhold His decree from being enforced.<br>
<br>39"Burden": the burden of the responsibilities of actions. It means: In the 
sight of Allah every one is responsible for his own actions and for no one 
else's. There is no possibility that Allah will place the burden of one man's 
responsibility upon the other, nor is there the possibility that a person will 
take the burden of another's responsibility upon himself and get himself seized 
for the crime committed by the other. This thing has been said here because the 
polytheist kinsmen and relatives of the people who were embracing Islam in 
Makkah, used to urge them, saying, Give up Islam and return to your ancestral 
faith. We take the responsibility of any punishment etc. on ourselves."<br><br>
40In the preceding sentence, Allah's law of justice has been enunciated, 
according to which He will not seize any person for the sin committed by 
another, but will hold everyone responsible for his own sin. In this sentence 
the Muslims have been told: `Those who urge you to give up faith and commit evil 
on the assurance that they will take on themselves the burden of your sins on 
the Day of Resurrection, are in fact giving you a false hope. When Resurrection 
comes and the people see what fate they are going to meet in consequence of 
their misdeed, everyone will be concerned only about himself. Brother will turn 
away from brother and father from son, and no one will be prepared to take even 
an atom's weight of another's burden on himself." <br><br>41In other words, 
"Your warnings cannot have any effect on obstinate and stubborn people. Your 
admonitions can bring only such people to the right path, who have fear of God 
in their hearts, and who are inclined to bow before their real Master." <br><br>
42In these comparisons the present and the future of a believer and a 
disbeliever have been contrasted. There is a person who has closed his eyes to 
the realities and does not care to see as to what truth the whole system of the 
universe and his own existence itself are pointing. There is the other person, 
whose eyes are open and who clearly sees that everything outside and inside 
himself bears evidence to the Unity of God and to man's answerability before 
him. There is a person, who is wandering blindly in the superstitions of 
ignorance and the darknesses of presumptions and speculations, and is not 
inclined to benefit by the light of the candle lit by the Prophet. There is the 
other person, whose eyes are open and who, as soon as the light spread by the 
Prophet appears before him, comes to realize that All the ways being followed by 
the polytheists and the disbelievers and the atheists lead to destruction, and 
the way to success is only that which has been shown by the Messenger of God. 
Now how can it be possible that the attitude of the two persons be the same in 
the world and the two may follow one and the same path together ? And how can 
this also be possible either that the two should meet the same end and should 
both end up in the dust after death ? Neither should one be punished for his 
wrongdoings, nor the other be rewarded for his righteous conduct. The sentence, 
"the cool shade and the heat of the sun are not alike", points to the same fate. 
The one will be provided shelter tinder the shade of Allah's mercy and the other 
will bum in the fire of Hell. Thus, the notions that the two will ultimately 
meet the same end is utterly false. In the end, the believer has been likened to 
the living and the stubborn disbeliever to the dead. That is, the believer is he 
whose feeling, understanding and perception are alive and whose conscience is 
making him aware of the distinction between the good and the evil every moment. 
Contrary to this, the person who has been, wholly lost in the prejudices of 
disbelief is even worse than the blind person who is wandering about in 
darkness. Nay, he is like a dead person who has no sense or feeling left in him.<br>
<br>43That is, "As for the powers of Allah, they are unlimited. He can even make 
the stones to hear. But it is not within the power of the Messenger to make 
those people to listen to him whose consciences have become dead and whose ears 
deaf to every call to the truth. He can only make those people to hear him, who 
are inclined to listen to every reasonable thing.<br><br>44That is, "Your only 
duty is to warn the people and nothing else. If even after this a person does 
not come to his senses, and remains lost in his deviations, you are not to blame 
for that, for you have not been entrusted with the duty of making the blind to 
see and the deaf to hear.<br><br>45That there has been no community in the world 
for whose guidance Allah did not appoint the Prophets, has been stated at 
several places in the Qur'an. In Surah Ar-Ra'd: 7, it was said: "Every people 
has its guide ;" in Surah Al-Hijr: 10: "O Prophet, We have already sent 
Messengers before you among many of the ancient peoples;" in Surah An-Nahl: 36: 
"We sent to every community a Messenger;" and in Surah Ash-Shu'ara: 208: "We 
have never destroyed a habitation unless it had its warners to administer 
admonition. " But, in this connection, one should note two things so that there 
remains no misunderstanding. First, one and the same Prophet is enough for the 
lands to which his message may reach. It is not necessary that Prophets be sent 
to every separate habitation and to every separate community. Second, no new 
Prophet needs to be sent as long as the message and teaching and guidance given 
by a previous Prophet remains safe and intact. It is not necessary that a 
separate Prophet be sent for every race and every generation.<br><br>46Clear 
proofs": Proofs which clearly testified that they were Allah's Messengers. <br>
<br>47"Scriptures" probably consisted of good counsels and moral precepts and 
"the Book" comprised a complete code of the law.<br><br>48This is meant to 
impress that in the universe created by Allah nowhere is there homogeneity and 
uniformity; there is variety everywhere. From the same earth and by the same 
water different kinds of trees are appearing. Even the two pieces of the fruit 
of the same tree are not uniform in color and size and taste. In the same 
mountain one will see a variety of colors and a great difference in the material 
composition of its different parts. Even among human beings and animals one will 
not see two offspring of the same parents exactly alike. If a person seeks 
uniformity of the temperaments and dispositions and mentalities in this universe 
and is bewildered at the differences which have been alluded to in vv. 19-22 
above, it will be his own perception and understanding to blame. This same 
variety and difference, in fact, point to the reality that this universe has 
been created by a Wise Being with great wisdom; its Maker is a Unique Creator 
and a Matchless Fashioner, Who does not have the same model of everything before 
Him, but has a variety of countless and limitless designs of everything. Then if 
one ponders over the differences in human temperaments and minds, in particular. 
one will see that it is not a mere accident, but in fact the masterpiece of the 
wisdom of creation. If all human beings had been created with the uniform 
temperaments and desires and feelings and inclinations and ways of thinking, and 
no room had been left for any difference, it would have been absolutely useless 
to bring about a new creation like man in the world. When the Creator decided to 
bring into existence a responsible creation, a creation having power and 
authority, the necessary inevitable demand of the nature of the decision was 
that room for all sorts of differences should be provided in its nature and 
structure. This is the main proof of the fact that the creation of man is not 
the result of an accident, but the result of a wonderful and wise plan and 
design. And obviously, wherever there is a wise plan and design, there must 
necessarily be a Wise Being working behind it, for the existence of wisdom 
without a Wise Being would be un-imaginable.<br><br>49That is, the more a person 
is unaware of the attributes of Allah, the more he will be fearless of Him. 
Contrary to this, the more a person is aware and conscious of Allah's powers, 
His knowledge, His wisdom, His vengeance and His omnipotence and His other 
attributes, the more he will fear His disobedience. Thus, in fact, ¦knowledge" 
in this verse does not imply knowledge of academic subjects like philosophy and 
science and history and mathematics, etc. but the knowledge of Divine 
attributes, no matter whether one is literate or illiterate. The one who is 
fearless of God is illiterate merely as regards this knowledge even if he has 
All the knowledge of the world. And the one who knows the attributes of God and 
fears Him in his heart, is learned even if he is illiterate. In the same 
connection, one should also know that in this verse the ' ulama ' does not imply 
the scholars in the technical sense, who are termed as religious scholars 
because of their knowledge of the Qur'an and Hadith and Fiqh and philosophy. 
They will prove true to this verse only when they possess fear of God in their 
hearts. The same thing has been said by Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, thus: 
"knowledge is not due to much narration of Hadith but due to much fear of 
Allah." And also by Hadrat Hassan Basri, thus: "The scholar is he who fears 
Allah though he has not seen Him, and turns to what is approved by Him and keeps 
away from what makes Him angry."<br><br>50That is, He is All-Mighty, and 
therefore, can seize the disobedient as and when He likes: no one can escape His 
grasp. But He is All-Forgiving alsa and is, therefore, giving respite to the 
wrongdoers.<br><br>51This kind of conduct and practice of the believers has been 
likened to a trade bargain because in trade a man invests his money and labor 
and capabilities in the hope that he will not only get his capital back and his 
wages for the time and energy spent but in addition some profit as well. 
Likewise, a believer also invests his wealth and his time and his labor and 
capabilities in carrying out Allah's Commands and in His service and worship and 
in the struggle to promote the cause of His Religion in the hope that he will 
not only get his full rewards for it but Allah will bless him with much more 
from His bounty as well. But there is a great difference between the two kinds 
of bargains. In the worldly trade bargains there is the risk of loss also along 
with the hope of profits. Contrary to this, in the bargain that a sincere 
servant makes with his God there is : no risk of any loss whatever. <br><br>
52That is, "Allah's relation with the sincere believers is not that of a miserly 
master who checks his servant on trivialities and brings all his services and 
loyalties to naught on account of a minor error. But Allah is the Most 
Beneficent. and Generous Master. He overlooks the errors of His obedient servant 
and appreciates whatever service he might be able to render."<br><br>53It means: 
This Book is not presenting anything new which might be opposed to the teaching 
brought by the former Prophets, but it is presenting the same eternal Truth 
which all the Prophets have been presenting from the very beginning.<br><br>
54The object of mentioning these attributes of Allah here is to arouse the 
people to the aims and ideals in which their true well being lies, to the 
principles which alone can afford the right guidance and to the rules and 
regulations which are precisely in accordance with them. None can know these 
except Allah, because He alone is aware of the nature of His servants and its 
demands, and He alone watches over their well-being and affairs. The people do 
not know their own selves as much as their Creator knows them. Therefore, the 
truth is that, and can only be that, which He has taught by Revelation.<br><br>
55This implies the Muslims, who have been sorted out from all mankind so that 
they may become heirs to the Book of Allah, and convey its message to others 
after the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings). 
Though this Book has been presented before all human beings, those who accepted 
it in the first instance, were chosen for the honor to become heirs to a great 
Book like the Qur'an and the trustees of the teaching and guidance imparted by a 
great Messenger like the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and 
blessings). <br><br>56That is, "All these Muslims are not alike but are divided 
into three classes:<br><br>(1) Those unjust to themselves: They are those who 
believe sincerely and honestly that the Qur'an is the . Book of Allah and 
Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) the Messenger of Allah, but in practical 
life do not fully follow the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. They 
are believers but sinful; culprits but not rebellious; weak of faith but not 
hypocritical and unbelieving at heart. Therefore, although they are ¦unjust to 
themselves," they have been included among the chosen servants of God and among 
the heirs to the Book; otherwise, obviously the rebels and the hypocrites and 
the unbelieving people could not be so treated and honored. This class of the 
believers have been mentioned first of All because they are most numerous among 
the Muslims.<br><br>(2) Those following the middle course: They are the people 
who fulfill the obligations of this inheritance to some extent but not fully. 
They are obedient as well as erring. They have not left their self altogether 
free but try as best as they can to turn it to God's obedience; however, at 
times they give it undue freedom and become involved in sin. Thus, their life 
becomes a combination of both the good and the evil actions. They are less 
numerous than the first group but more than the third; that is why they have 
been mentioned second.<br><br>(3) Those excelling in good deeds: They are the 
people of the first rank among the heirs to the Book, and they are the ones who 
are doing full justice to the inheritance. They are in the forefront in 
following and adhering to the Book and the Sunnah; in conveying the message of 
God to His servants, in offering the sacrifices for the sake of the true Faith, 
and in every pious and good work. They arc not the ones who would commit a sin 
deliberately, but if they happened to commit a sin inadvertently, they would be 
filled with remorse as soon as they became conscious of it. They are less 
numerous than the people of the first two groups, and therefore, have been 
mentioned last, although they merit the first place in the matter of doing 
justice to the heritage of the Book of Allah<br><br>As for the sentence, "this 
is the supreme bounty', if it is related with the last sentence, it would mean 
that to excel in good deeds is the supreme bounty, and the people who excel in 
good deeds are the best of the Muslim community. And if it is taken to be 
related with the first sentence, it would mean that to be a heir to the Book of 
Allah and to be chosen for this heritage is the supreme bounty, and the people 
who have been so chosen on account of their faith in the Qur'an and the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad arc the best among the human beings created by Allah. <br><br>
57One section of the commentators has held the view that this sentence is 
related with the two sentences immediately preceding it. That is, the ones who 
excel in good duds are the best of the people and they alone will enter the 
Gardens. As for the first two groups, nothing has been stated about them so that 
they became worried concerning their fate and try to improve their lot. This 
view has been presented by `Allama Zamakhshari forcefully and supported by Imam 
Razi.<br><br>But the majority of the commentators opine that it is related with 
the whole preceding discourse, which means that all the three classes of the 
Ummah shall eventually enter Paradise, whether without accountability, or afar 
the accountability, whether remaining secure from every punishment, or after 
receiving some punishment. This commentary is supported by the Qur'anic context, 
for a little below about those who are contrasted with the heirs of the Book, it 
has been said: "And for those who have disbelieved, there is the fire of Hell. " 
This shows that there is Paradise for all those who have believed in the Hook, 
and Hell for all those who have refused to believe in it. The same has been 
supported by the Hadith of the Holy Prophet, which Imam Ahmad, Ibn Jarir, Ibn 
Abi Hatim, Tabarani, Baihaqi and some other traditionalists have related on the 
authority of Hadrat Abu ad-Darda'. The Holy Prophet said:<br><br>Those who have 
excelled in good works shall enter Paradise without; and those who arc following 
the middle course, shall be subjected to accountability; but their 
accountability shall be light. As for those who have been unjust to themselves, 
they shall be detained throughout the long period of Resurrection and 
accountability (mahshar). Then Allah shall cover them also with His mercy. And 
they are the ones who will say: 'Thanks to Allah Who has removed sorrow from 
us!'"<br><br>In this Hadith the Holy Prophet has himself given a complete 
commentary of the verse under discussion, and stated separately the end to be 
met by each of the three groups of the believers. The "light accountability" for 
the ones following the middle course means this: The disbelievers will be 
punished for their disbelief as well as for each single crime and sin of theirs 
separately, but, contrary to this, the good and bad deeds of the believers who 
come with both the good and evil deeds will be judged on the whole: they will 
not be rewarded for each good deed and punished for each evil deed separately. 
As for those "who will be detained throughout the period of Resurrection and 
accountability because they had been unjust to themselves," it means: They will 
not be thrown into Hell, but will be sentenced to be detained "till the rising 
of the Court." In other words, they will be exposed to all the severities and 
rigors of the lengthy Day of Resurrection (and God alone knows how lengthy it 
will be !) till Allah Almighty will turn to them in His mercy and command at the 
rising of the Court that they too be admitted into Paradise. The traditionists 
have cited several sayings to the same effect from many Companions like Hadrat 
'Umar, Hadrat `Uthman, Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin `Abbas, 
Hadrat `A`ishah, Hadrat Abu Said Khudri and Hadrat Bara bin 'Azib. And 
obviously, the Companions could not have said any such thing in such matters 
unless they had heard it from the Holy Prophet himself.<br><br>But from this one 
should not form the impression that `those who have been unjust to themselves" 
from among the Muslims will only be sentenced to be detained "till the rising of 
the Court", and none of them will go to Hell at all. Several crimes have been 
mentioned in the Qur'an and Hadith, whose perpetrator will go to Hell in spite 
of his faith. For instance, Allah Himself has declared that the believer who 
kills another believer willfully shall go to Hell. Likewise, Hell has been 
mentioned as the punishment of those people also who violate the provisions of 
the Divine Law of Inheritance. Those who devour interest even after its 
prohibition have been declared to be "the dwellers of Hell." Besides these, some 
other major sins also have been mentioned in Hadith, whose perpetrator shall go 
to Hell. <br><br>58"Sorrow": Sorrow of every kind: sorrows and Briefs and 
worries of the world and of the Hereafter with regard to the final end. It means 
: "Now we have nothing to worry about: now there can be no question of any 
sorrow and trouble afflicting us here. "<br><br>59That is "He has forgiven us 
our errors, has appreciated whatever little provision of deeds we had brought 
and blessed us with His Paradise as a reward."<br><br>60That is, "The world was 
a stage in our journey of life, which we have crossed, and the plain of 
Resurrection also is a stage of the same journey, which we have also crossed. 
Now we have reached a place which is our eternal abode: we have not to go 
elsewhere from here." <br><br>61In other words, "All our toils and afflictions 
have come to an end. Now we do not have to perform any work here in carrying out 
which we might have to experience any rigor or hardship and after carrying out 
which we might be fatigued."<br><br>62"Who have disbelieved": Who have refused 
to believe in the Book which Allah has sent down on Muhammad (upon whom be His 
peace and blessings). <br><br>63This implies every such age of life in which a 
person may be able to distinguish between good and evil, truth and falsehood, if 
he likes to, and turn to right guidance instead of deviation, if he wishes. If a 
person has died before attaining such an age, he will not be called to any 
account according to this verse. However, the one who has attained this age will 
certainly be held answerable for his actions. Then, as long as he lives after 
attaining this age and gets more and more opportunities for choosing and 
adopting the right path, his responsibility also will increase accordingly; so 
much so that the one who does not adopt right guidance even in old age will have 
no chance left for making any excuse. This same thing has been reported by 
Hadrat Abu Hurairah and Hadrat Sahl bin Sa'd as-Sa'idi in a Hadith, saying: "The 
one who lives a short life has an excuse to offer, but there is no room for 
making an excuse for him who lives for 60 years or more." (Bukhari Ahmad, 
Nasa'i, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim).<br><br>64This can have two meanings:<br><br>
(1) "Now He has settled you on His earth after the passing away of the previous 
generations and nations;" and<br><br>(2) "the powers and authority that He has 
given you over different things in the earth are not meant to make you the 
owners of these things but are meant to enable you to function as the 
representatives of their real Owner. " <br><br>65If the previous sentence is 
taken to mean that you have been made successors to the previous nations, this 
sentence would mean this: "The one who did not learn any lesson from the fate of 
the previous nations and adopted the conduct of disbelief due to which those 
nations have gone to their doom, will himself see the evil end of his folly." 
And if the sentence is taken to mean this that Allah has delegated to you powers 
and authority as His vicegerents in the earth, this sentence would mean: `He who 
forgot this position of vicegerency and became independent, or he who adopted 
service of someone else, apart from his real Master, would see the evil end of 
his rebellious conduct himself." <br><br>66"Associates of yours", because they 
are not in fact the associates of Allah, but the ones whom the polytheists 
themselves have made associates of Allah. <br><br>67That is, "Do they possess a 
written sanction from Us in which We might have indicated that We have given 
such and such persons the powers to heal the sick, or to get jobs for the 
jobless, or to fulfill needs of the needy, or that We have made such and such 
beings Our representatives in such and such parts of the earth and now it is in 
their hands to make or mar the destinies of the people of those parts; 
therefore, Our servants now should pray to them and present gifts and offerings 
before them, and for whatever blessings they receive they should thank those 
"demigods" only? If you possess any such sanction, produce it. And if you have 
no such sanction, you should consider on what grounds you have invented these 
polytheistic creeds and practices. When you are asked as to what sign is there 
in the heavens and the earth that may point to your self invented gods as being 
God's associates, you cannot point out any. When you arc asked to product any 
Divine sanction from any Book of Allah, or from your own possession, or from the 
possession of your self-invented gods, which may testify to God s having Himself 
delegated to them those powers which you assign to them, you do not produce any. 
What then is the basis of your these creeds and concepts? Are you the owners of 
the Divine rights and powers that you may assign and distribute them to 
whomsoever you please?" <br><br>68That is, "These religious guides, saints, 
priests, sorcerers, preachers and attendants of shrines and their agents are 
fooling the people for selfish motives, and are concocting stories to give them 
false hopes that if they became the followers of such and such personalities, 
apart from God, they would have all their wishes and needs fulfilled in the 
world, and all their sins, no matter-how grave and numerous, forgiven by Allah 
in the Hereafter."<br><br>69That is, "This limitless universe is being sustained 
by Allah alone. No angel, or jinn, or prophet, or saint can sustain it. Not to 
speak of sustaining the universe these helpless creatures do not even have the 
power to Sustain their own selves. Each one of them is entirely dependent on 
Allah Almighty for his birth and survival every moment. To think that any one of 
them has any share in the attributes and powers of Divinity is sheer folly and 
deception. "<br><br>70That is, "It is Allah's Clemency and Forbearance that He 
is not seizing the culprits immediately in punishment in spite of All kinds of 
disobedience which are being shown towards Him "<br><br>71Before the advent of 
the Holy Prophet, the same thing used to be said by the Arabs, in general, and 
by the Quraish, in particular, when they witnessed the moral degeneration of the 
Jews and the Christians. Mention of this saying of theirs has also been made in 
Surah Al-An'am :156-157 above, and in Surah AsSaffat: 167-169 below. <br><br>
72That is, this Law of Allah that the nation which repudiates its Prophet, is 
destroyed should be applied in their case as well. </p>
