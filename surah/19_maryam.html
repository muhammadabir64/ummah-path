We give thee good news of a son: His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction before."</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, ´that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!´"</li><li class="collection-item"> (Zakariya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou art not dumb."</li><li class="collection-item"> So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber: He told them by signs to celebrate Allah´s praises in the morning and in the evening.</li><li class="collection-item"> (To his son came the command): "O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth,</li><li class="collection-item"> And piety (for all creatures) as from Us, and purity: He was devout,</li><li class="collection-item"> And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious.</li><li class="collection-item"> So Peace on him the day he was born, the day that he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life (again)!</li><li class="collection-item"> Relate in the Book (the story of) Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East.</li><li class="collection-item"> She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects.</li><li class="collection-item"> She said: "I seek refuge from thee to (Allah) Most Gracious: (come not near) if thou dost fear Allah."</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son.</li><li class="collection-item"> She said: "How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?"</li><li class="collection-item"> He said: "So (it will be): Thy Lord saith, ´that is easy for Me: and (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign unto men and a Mercy from Us´:It is a matter (so) decreed."</li><li class="collection-item"> So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place.</li><li class="collection-item"> And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm-tree: She cried (in her anguish): "Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!"</li><li class="collection-item"> But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): "Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee;</li><li class="collection-item"> "And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee.</li><li class="collection-item"> "So eat and drink and cool (thine) eye.

I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from (Allah) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend."</li><li class="collection-item"> (The father) replied: "Dost thou hate my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will indeed stone thee: Now get away from me for a good long while!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Abraham said: "Peace be on thee: I will pray to my Lord for thy forgiveness: for He is to me Most Gracious.</li><li class="collection-item"> "And I will turn away from you (all) and from those whom ye invoke besides Allah: I will call on my Lord: perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord, I shall be not unblest."</li><li class="collection-item"> When he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet.</li><li class="collection-item"> And We bestowed of Our Mercy on them, and We granted them lofty honour on the tongue of truth.</li><li class="collection-item"> Also mention in the Book (the story of) Moses: for he was specially chosen, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.</li><li class="collection-item"> And we called him from the right side of Mount (Sinai), and made him draw near to Us, for mystic (converse).</li><li class="collection-item"> And, out of Our Mercy, We gave him his brother Aaron, (also) a prophet.</li><li class="collection-item"> Also mention in the Book (the story of) Isma´il: He was (strictly) true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet.</li><li class="collection-item"> He used to enjoin on his people Prayer and Charity, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord.</li><li class="collection-item"> Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet:</li><li class="collection-item"> And We raised him to a lofty station.</li><li class="collection-item"> Those were some of the prophets on whom Allah did bestow His Grace,- of the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose. Whenever the Signs of (Allah) Most Gracious were rehearsed to them, they would fall down in prostrate adoration and in tears.</li><li class="collection-item"> But after them there followed a posterity who missed prayers and followed after lusts soon, then, will they face Destruction,-</li><li class="collection-item"> Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness: for these will enter the Garden and will not be wronged in the least,-</li><li class="collection-item"> Gardens of Eternity, those which (Allah) Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the Unseen: for His promise must (necessarily) come to pass.</li><li class="collection-item"> They will not there hear any vain discourse, but only salutations of Peace: And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and evening.</li><li class="collection-item"> Such is the Garden which We give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who guard against Evil.</li><li class="collection-item"> (The angels say:) "We descend not but by command of thy Lord: to Him belongeth what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between: and thy Lord never doth forget,-</li><li class="collection-item"> "Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that is between them; so worship Him, and be constant and patient in His worship: knowest thou of any who is worthy of the same Name as He?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Man says: "What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?"</li><li class="collection-item"> But does not man call to mind that We created him before out of nothing?</li><li class="collection-item"> So, by thy Lord, without doubt, We shall gather them together, and (also) the Evil Ones (with them); then shall We bring them forth on their knees round about Hell;</li><li class="collection-item"> Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against (Allah) Most Gracious.</li><li class="collection-item"> And certainly We know best those who are most worthy of being burned therein.</li><li class="collection-item"> Not one of you but will pass over it: this is, with thy Lord, a Decree which must be accomplished.</li><li class="collection-item"> But We shall save those who guarded against evil, and We shall leave the wrong-doers therein, (humbled) to their knees.</li><li class="collection-item"> When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say to those who believe, "Which of the two sides is best in point of position? Which makes the best show in council?"</li><li class="collection-item"> But how many (countless) generations before them have we destroyed, who were even better in equipment and in glitter to the eye?</li><li class="collection-item"> Say: "If any men go astray, (Allah) Most Gracious extends (the rope) to them, until, when they see the warning of Allah (being fulfilled) - either in punishment or in (the approach of) the Hour,- they will at length realise who is worst in position, and (who) weakest in forces!</li><li class="collection-item"> "And Allah doth advance in guidance those who seek guidance: and the things that endure, Good Deeds, are best in the sight of thy Lord, as rewards, and best in respect of (their) eventual return."</li><li class="collection-item"> Hast thou then seen the (sort of) man who rejects Our Signs, yet says: "I shall certainly be given wealth and children?"</li><li class="collection-item"> Has he penetrated to the Unseen, or has he taken a contract with (Allah) Most Gracious?</li><li class="collection-item"> Nay! We shall record what he says, and We shall add and add to his punishment.</li><li class="collection-item"> To Us shall return all that he talks of and he shall appear before Us bare and alone.</li><li class="collection-item"> And they have taken (for worship) gods other than Allah, to give them power and glory!</li><li class="collection-item"> Instead, they shall reject their worship, and become adversaries against them.</li><li class="collection-item"> Seest thou not that We have set the Evil Ones on against the unbelievers, to incite them with fury?</li><li class="collection-item"> So make no haste against them, for We but count out to them a (limited) number (of days).</li><li class="collection-item"> The day We shall gather the righteous to (Allah) Most Gracious, like a band presented before a king for honours,</li><li class="collection-item"> And We shall drive the sinners to Hell, like thirsty cattle driven down to water,-</li><li class="collection-item"> None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from (Allah) Most Gracious.</li><li class="collection-item"> They say: "(Allah) Most Gracious has begotten a son!"</li><li class="collection-item"> Indeed ye have put forth a thing most monstrous!</li><li class="collection-item"> At it the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin,</li><li class="collection-item"> That they should invoke a son for (Allah) Most Gracious.</li><li class="collection-item"> For it is not consonant with the majesty of (Allah) Most Gracious that He should beget a son.</li><li class="collection-item"> Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (Allah) Most Gracious as a servant.</li><li class="collection-item"> He does take an account of them (all), and hath numbered them (all) exactly.</li><li class="collection-item"> And everyone of them will come to Him singly on the Day of Judgment.</li><li class="collection-item"> On those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, will (Allah) Most Gracious bestow love.</li><li class="collection-item"> So have We made the (Qur´an) easy in thine own tongue, that with it thou mayest give Glad Tidings to the righteous, and warnings to people given to contention.</li><li class="collection-item"> But how many (countless) generations before them have We destroyed?

<p><strong>Name</strong><br><br>It takes its name from v. 16.<br><br><strong>
Period of Revelation</strong><br><br>It was revealed before the Migration to 
Habash. We learn from authentic Traditions that Hadrat Ja'afar recited vv. 1-40 
of this Surah in the court of Negus when he called the migrants to his court.<br>
<br><strong>Historical Background</strong><br><br>We have already briefly 
referred to the conditions of that period in the introduction to Surah Al-Kahf. 
Here we shall give rather fuller details of the same conditions, which will be 
helpful in grasping the meaning of this Surah and the other Surahs of the 
period. When the chiefs of the Quraish felt that they had failed to suppress the 
Islamic movement by ridicule, sarcasm, and by holding out promises and threats 
and by making false accusations, they resorted to persecution, beating and 
economic pressure. They would catch hold of the new Muslims of their clans and 
persecute them, starve them and would even inflict physical torture on them in 
order to coerce them to give up Islam. The most pitiful victims of their 
persecution were the poor people and the slaves and the proteges of the Quraish. 
They were beaten black and blue, were imprisoned and kept thirsty and hungry and 
were dragged on the burning sands of Makkah. The people would get work from the 
professional laborers but would not pay them their wages. As an instance we give 
below the story of Hadrat Khabbab bin Arat, which is given in Bukhari and 
Muslim:<br><br>"I used to work as a blacksmith in Makkah. Once I did some work 
for As bin Wa'il. When I went to ask for my wages, he said, 'I will not pay your 
wages unless you disown Muhammad'."<br><br>In the same connection Hadrat Khabbab 
says, "One day the Holy Prophet was sitting in the shadow of the Ka'abah. I went 
to him and said, '0 Messenger of Allah, now persecution has gone to its extreme; 
why do you not pray to Allah (for relief)?' At this the Holy Prophet was greatly 
moved. He said, 'The believers before you were persecuted much more than you. 
Their bones were scraped with combs of iron and their heads were cut with saws, 
but still they did not give up their Faith. I assure you that Allah will fulfill 
this Mission, and there will come a period of such peace that one would travel 
from Sanna to Hadramaut, and he will have no fear from anyone, save Allah. But 
you people have already become impatient'." (Bukhari)<br><br>When the conditions 
became unbearable, the Holy Prophet, in the month of Rajab of the fifth year of 
Prophethood, gave advice to his Companions to this effect: "You may well migrate 
to Habash, for there is a king, who does not allow any kind of injustice to 
anyone, and there is good in his land. You should remain there till the time 
that Allah provides a remedy for your affliction".<br><br>Accordingly, at first, 
eleven men and four women left for Habash. The Quraish pursued them up to the 
coast but fortunately they got a timely boat for Habash at the sea-port of 
Shu'aibah, and they escaped attest. Then after a few months, other people 
migrated to Habash and their number rose to eighty-three men and eleven women of 
the Quraish and seven non-Quraish. After this, only forty persons were left with 
the Holy Prophet at Makkah.<br><br>There was a great hue and cry in Makkah after 
this Migration, for every family of the Quraish was adversely affected by this. 
There was hardly a family of the Quraish which did not lose a son, a son-in-law, 
a daughter, a brother or a sister. For instance, there were among the Migrants 
the near relatives of Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan and other chief of the Quraish who 
were notorious for their persecution of the Muslims. As a result of this, some 
of them became even more bitter in their enmity of Islam, while there were 
others who were so moved by this that they embraced Islam. For instance, this 
Migration left a deep mark on Hadrat Umar. One of his relatives, Laila, daughter 
of Hathmah, says, "I was packing my luggage for Migration, while my husband, Amr 
bin Rabiy'ah, had gone out. In the meantime Umar came there and began to watch 
me, while I was engaged in preparation for the journey. Then he said, 'Are you 
also going to migrate?' I answered, 'Yes by God, you people have persecuted us 
much. But the wide earth of Allah is open for us. Now we are going to a place 
where Allah will grant us peace'. At this, I noticed such signs of emotion on 
the face of Umar as I had never seen before. He simply said, 'May God be with 
you' and went away."<br><br>After the migration, the Quraish held consultations, 
and decided to send Abdullah bin Abi Rabiy'ah, half brother of Abu Jahl, and Amr 
bin As to Habash with precious gifts so as to persuade Negus to send the 
migrants back to Makkah. Hadrat Umm Salmah (a wife of the Holy Prophet), who was 
among the migrants, has related this part of the story in detail. She says, 
"When these two clever statesmen of the Quraish reached Habash, they distributed 
the gifts among the courtiers of the King and persuaded them to recommend 
strongly to him to send the migrants back. Then they saw Negus himself and, 
presenting rich gifts to him, said, "Some headstrong brats of our city have come 
to your land and our chiefs have sent us to you with the request that you may 
kindly send them back. These brats have forsaken our faith and have not embraced 
your faith either, but have invented a new faith". As soon as they had finished 
their speech, all the courtiers recommended their case, saying, "We should send 
such people back to their city for their people know them better. It is not 
proper for us to keep them here." At this the King was annoyed and said, "I am 
not going to give them back without proper inquiry. As these people have put 
their trust in my country rather than in any other country and have come here to 
take shelter, I will not betray them. At first I will send for them and 
investigate into the allegations these people have made against them. Then I 
will make my final decision". Accordingly, the King sent for the Companions of 
the Holy Prophet and asked them to come to his court.<br><br>When the migrants 
received the message of the King, they assembled and held consultations as to 
what they should say to the King. At last they came to this unanimous decision: 
"We will present before the King the teachings of the Holy Prophet without 
adding anything to or withholding anything from them and leave it to him whether 
he lets us remain here or turns us out of his country". When they came to the 
court, the King put this problem abruptly before them:"I understand that you 
have given up the faith of your own people and have neither embraced my faith 
nor any other existing faith. I would like to know what your new faith is." At 
this, Jafar bin Abi Talib, on behalf of the migrants, made an extempore speech 
to this effect: "O King! We were sunk deep in ignorance and had become very 
corrupt; then Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) came to us as a Messenger of 
God, and did his best to reform us. But the Quraish began to persecute his 
followers, so we have come to your country in the hope that here we will be free 
from persecution". After his speech, the King said, "Please recite a piece of 
the Revelation which has been sent down by God to your Prophet". In response, 
Hadrat Jafar recited that portion of Surah Maryam which relates the story of 
Prophets John and Jesus (Allah's peace be upon them). The King listened to it 
and wept, so much so that his beard became wet with tears. When Hadrat Jafar 
finished the recital, he said:"Most surely this Revelation and the Message of 
Jesus have come from the same source. By God I will not give you up into the 
hands of these people".<br><br>Next day `Amr bin `As went to Negus and said, 
"Please send for them again and ask them concerning the creed they hold about 
Jesus, the son of Mary, for they say a horrible thing about him". The King again 
sent for the migrants, who had already learned about the scheme of Amr. They 
again sat together and held consultations in regard to the answer they should 
give to the King, if he asked about the belief they held about Prophet Jesus. 
Though this was a very critical situation and all of them were uneasy about it, 
they decided that they would say the same thing that Allah and His Messenger had 
taught them. Accordingly, when they went to the court, the King put them the 
question that had been suggested by Amr bin As. So Jafar bin Abi Talib stood up 
and answered without the least hesitation: "He was a Servant of Allah and His 
Messenger. He was a Spirit and a Word of Allah which had been sent to virgin 
Mary." At this the King picked up a straw from the ground and said, 'Bye God, 
Jesus was not worth this straw more than what you have said about him." After 
this the King returned the gifts sent by the Quraish, saying, "I do not take any 
bribe". Then he said to the migrants, "You are allowed to stay here in perfect 
peace."<br><br>Theme and Subject<br><br>Keeping in view this historical 
background, it becomes quite obvious that this Surah was sent down to serve the 
migrants as a "provision" for their journey to Habash, as if to say, "Though you 
are leaving your country as persecuted emigrants to a Christian country, you 
should not in the least hide anything from the teachings you have received. 
There- fore you should plainly say to the Christians that Prophet Jesus was not 
the son of God."<br><br>After relating the story of Prophets John and Jesus in 
vv. 1-40, the story of Prophet Abraham has been related (vv. 41-50) also for the 
benefit of the Migrants for he also had been forced like them to leave his 
country by the persecution of his father, his family and his country men. On the 
one hand, this meant to console the Emigrants that they were following the 
footsteps of Prophet Abraham and would attain the same good end as that Prophet 
did. On the other hand, it meant to warn the disbeliever, of Makkah that they 
should note it well that they were in the position of the cruel people who had 
persecuted their forefather and leader, Abraham, while the Muslim Emigrants were 
in the position of Prophet Abraham himself.<br><br>Then the mention of the other 
Prophets has been made in vv. 51-65 with a view to impress that Muhammad 
(Allah's peace be upon him) had brought the same way of Life that had been 
brought by the former Prophets but their followers had become corrupt and 
adopted wrong ways.<br><br>In the concluding passage (vv. 66-98), a strong 
criticism has been made of the evil ways of the disbelievers of Makkah, while 
the Believers have been given the good news that they would come out successful 
and become the beloved of the people, in spite of the worst efforts of the 
enemies of the Truth.</p>

<p>1For comparison please see the story of Zachariah as given in vv. 34-57 of 
Al-i-Imran (III) and the E.N.'s thereof.<br><br>2In order to understand the 
position held by Hadrat Zachariah, a descendant ' of Prophet Aaron, one should 
be acquainted with the system of priesthood among the children of Israel.<br>
<br>After the conquest of Palestine, the whole land was divided among the 12 
tribes of the descendants of Prophet Jacob as inheritance, and the 13th tribe 
(the Levites) were entrusted with religious services and duties. Even among the 
Levites, the house that was separated "to sanctify the most holy things .... to 
burn incense before the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for 
ever" was the house of Prophet Aaron. The other Levites were not allowed to 
enter the Temple "Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the 
service of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the 
purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of the 
God .... And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the Lord in the Sabbaths, in the 
new moon, and on the set festivals." The descendants of Aaron were divided into 
24 families, who came to serve the house of the Lord by turns. One of these 
families was of Abiah whose chief was Zachariah. Thus it was Zachariah's duty to 
go into the house on his family's turn and burn incense before the Lord. (For 
details, see I Chronicles, chapters 23, 24).<br><br>3That is, "I see none among 
my kinsmen, the family of Abiah, who is religiously and morally sound and 
capable of carrying on the work of the mission that has been entrusted to me."<br>
<br>4That is, "I do not pray for a successor to inherit me alone, but a 
successor who may inherit the good ways of the house of Jacob."<br><br>5In Luke 
the words are: "There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name." (1: 
61)<br><br>6This dialogue is meant to impress that Allah is able to do whatever 
He wills and can make an impotent man and a barren woman give birth to a child, 
and likewise a virgin can be made to conceive a child.<br><br>7For the 
explanation of mihrab (sanctuary), see E.N. 36 of Al-i-Imran<br><br>8Below we 
reproduce the details of this event as given in Luke's Gospel so that the. 
reader may study and compare the Quranic with the Christian version. The 
references and additions within the brackets are ours:<br><br>"There was in the 
days of Herod, the king of Judaea, (see Bani Isra'il (XVII): E.N. 9) a certain 
priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abiah: and his wife was of the 
daughters of Aaron, and her name wag Elisabeth. And they were both righteous 
before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord 
blameless. And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they 
both were now well stricken in years. And it came to pass, that while he 
executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course, according to 
the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into 
the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying 
without at the time of incense. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord 
standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, 
he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, Fear not, 
Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; (there is no mention of Zacharias' prayer 
anywhere in the Bible) and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou 
shalt call his name John (that is, Yahya). And thou shalt have joy and gladness; 
and many shall rejoice at his birth. For he shall be great in the sight of the 
Lord (Sayyidan: a great Leader according to the Qur'an, III: 39), and shall 
drink neither wine nor strong drink (the Quranic version: Taqiyynr. pious and 
pure); and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb 
(the Qur'an says: `We blessed him with "judgment" while he was yet a child'). 
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he 
shall go before him in the spirit of the power of Elias, to turn the hearts of 
the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to 
make ready a people prepared for the Lord.<br><br>"And Zacharias said unto the 
angel, Whereby shall I know this for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken 
in years. And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the 
presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad 
tidings. And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day 
that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which 
shall be fulfilled in their season. (This is different from the Qur'an, which 
gives it as a Sign, whereas according to Luke, it was a punishment. Moreover, 
the Qur'an mentions it as the silence for `three consecutive days', but Luke 
says that Zacharias remained dumb till the birth of John). And the people 
.waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple. And 
when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had 
seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained 
speechless." (Luke 1: 5-22).<br><br>9The details regarding the birth of Prophet 
John, according to the Divine will, and his coming of age, have been left out. 
Here, in one sentence, the Mission of Prophethood entrusted to him on attaining 
maturity has been stated, which was "to observe and follow the Torah in letter 
and spirit, and to exhort the Israelites as well to do the same."<br><br>10The 
Arabic word hukm implies ability (1) to make decisions, (2) to form right 
opinions, (3) to interpret the Divine Law, (4) to solve problems, and (5) it 
also means authority from Allah to decide affairs.<br><br>11The Arabic word 
hanan is almost synonymous with `mother love'. In other words, Prophet John bore 
in his heart the same kind of intense love for Allah's servants as a mother has 
for her child.<br><br>12In order to have a fuller understanding of the Mission 
and the pure character of Prophet John, about which brief references have been 
made in this Surah and Surah Al-i-`Imran, it will be useful to study this story 
as given in different Books of the New Testament in the following order:<br><br>
According to Luke, Prophet John was older than Prophet Jesus by six months and 
their mothers were cousins. He was appointed a Prophet at the age of 30 years, 
and according to the Gospel of John, he started his mission of inviting the 
people toward God in Jordan. He would say: "I am the voice of one crying in the 
wilderness. Make straight the way of the Lord." (John, I: 23)<br><br>According 
to Mark, "John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptizm of 
repentance for the remission of sins. And there went out unto him all the land 
of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of 
Jordan, confessing their sins." (Mark, I: 45). He thus came to be known as John 
the Baptist, and the Israelites held him as a prophet. (Mat. 21: 26). Prophet 
Jesus said about John: "Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a 
man greater than John the Baptist." (Mat. 11 : 11)<br><br>"John had his raiment 
of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts 
and wild honey." (Mat. 3: 4). He would say: "Repent ye: for the kingdom of 
heaven is at hand." (Mat. 3: 2). By this he meant that very soon Prophet Jesus 
was going to start his Mission of Prophethood. The same thing has been said 
about him in the Qur'an: ". . . he (John) will come to confirm a Command from 
Allah." (III: 39). For the same reason he has been called `a sign of or pointer 
to' Prophet Jesus.<br><br>He urged the people to observe the Fast and Prayers. 
(Mat. 9: 14, Luke, 5: 33, I1: 1). He would also tell them, ". . . He that hath 
two coats, let him -impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him 
do likewise." (Luke 3: 11). When the tax-collectors asked, "Master, what shall 
we do?" He said unto them, "Exact no more than that what is appointed you." 
(12-13), and when the soldiers sought his guidance, he said: "Do violence to no 
man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages." (Luke, 3: 14)'<br>
<br>When the corrupt scholars, Pharisees and Sadducees of the Israelites, came 
to be baptized by him, he rebuked them, saying: "O generation of vipers, who 
hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?..think not to say within 
yourselves, We have Abraham to our father... now also the ax is laid unto the 
root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is 
hewn down, and cast into the fire." (Mat-3 :7-10)<br><br>The Jewish ruler of his 
time, Herod Antipas, in whose tetrarchy he was performing his Mission of 
inviting the people to the Truth, had been so deeply influenced by the Roman 
civilization that he was causing sin and evil to spread freely in the land. He 
had kept Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, unlawfully in his house; when 
Prophet John reproved him for this and raised his voice against other evils 
being committed by him, Herod got him arrested and sent to jail. However, he 
held him in high esteem for his piety and righteousness and even feared him on 
account of the great respect he enjoyed among the people. On the contrary, 
Herodias thought that the moral consciousness that Prophet John was producing 
among the people was directly aimed at women like herself and pulling them down 
in the public eye. Thus she nursed a grudge against him and would have him 
killed but could not. Soon an opportunity came her way. On the birthday banquet 
of Herod, her daughter danced and so delighted Herod and others that the king 
said to her, 'Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.' The girl 
asked her mother what she should ask for. The mother said, `Ask for the head of 
John the Baptist.' The girl went back to the king and requested to have there 
and then the head of John the Baptist on a dish. Herod felt sorry to hear this, 
but could not reject the demand of the daughter of his beloved. He at once got 
Prophet John killed in the prison and presented his head on a dish to the 
dancing girl. (Mat. 14: 3-12, Mark, 6 :17-29, Luke, 3 :19-20).<br><br>13For 
comparison, see Al-i-Imran (III): 34-57, and An-Nina (IV) :156 and E.N.'s 
thereof.<br><br>14The Sanctuary where she had retired for devotion was an 
eastern chamber in the Temple, and as was customary she had hung a curtain to 
conceal herself from the people. It cannot be Nazareth as some people have 
wrongly taken it to be, because Nazareth is to the north of Jerusalem.<br><br>
15The word "So shall it be" are very significant as has been stated in E.N. 6. 
The plain meaning is this: "A pure son shall be born to you just as your Lord 
has decreed, even though no man has touched you. " The same was the response to 
prophet Zachariah as stated in v. 9 above. And it is a sheer perversion to 
interpret it as: "So shall it be that a man will touch you and a son will be 
born to you." For, if it were to mean: "You will bear a son like all other women 
of the world," the subsequent two sentences: "Your Lord says, 'This is an easy 
thing for Me to do, and We will make that boy a Sign for the people'," would 
have become meaningless: Had this birth been an ordinary birth like the birth of 
every other child, there would have been no occasion to boast: "It is an easy 
thing, and that it will be made a Sign (miracle). This will be so because the 
child will speak in the cradle."<br><br>16When she conceived the child, she left 
the Sanctuary and went to a distant place (Bethlehem) in order to escape the 
bitter criticism of the people. They would have said, "Look at the virgin 
daughter of the pious house of Aaron! She has conceived a child and that, too, 
in the Sanctuary where she had retired for devotion!" Thus she temporarily 
succeeded in concealing the shame of the conception, but this event itself is a 
proof that prophet Jesus was born without a father. Had Mary been married and 
had a husband, she would not have left his or her parents house by herself and 
chosen a distant place for the purpose of delivery.<br><br>17The words "Would 
that..." show the extreme state of anxiety in which Mary found herself at the 
time. She did not utter these words on account of the labor pains but due to the 
pangs of sorrow as to how she would conceal the child from her people. The 
angel's words---"Grieve not at all"explain why she had spoken these desperate 
words. When a married girl is delivering her first baby, she might be dying with 
pains, but she is never so sorrowful and grieved.<br><br>18That is, "You need 
not say anything with regard to the child. It is now Our responsibility to 
answer the critics." This also indicates why Mary was so sad and grieved. Had 
she been married and given birth to her first baby like any other mother, there 
was no occasion to tell her to observe "a fast of silence", though it was a 
common custom among the Jews."<br><br>19"Sister of Aaron" may either mean that 
Mary had a brother of the name of Aaron, or it may mean that she belonged to the 
family of Prophet Aaron. The first meaning is supported by a tradition of the 
Holy Prophet and the second is plausible because that is supported by the Arabic 
idiom. But we are inclined to the second meaning, for the wording of the said 
tradition does not necessarily mean that she actually had a brother named Aaron. 
The tradition as related in Muslim, Nasa'i, Tirmizi, etc. says that when the 
Christians of Najran criticized the Quranic version of stating Mary as the 
sister of Aaron before Hadrat Mughirah bin Shu`bah, he was not able to satisfy 
them, because Prophet Aaron had passed away centuries earlier. When he presented 
the problem before the Holy Prophet, he replied, "Why didn't you say that the 
Israelites named their children after their Prophets and other pious men?" That 
is, "You could have answered their objection like this as well." (See also E.N. 
32 of Al-i-Imran).<br><br>19aHow can the people who reject the miraculous birth 
of Prophet Jesus, explain why Mary's whole community had come out to curse and 
condemn her when she had appeared before them with the child?<br><br>20People 
who misinterpret the Qur'an translate this verse as: "How shall we talk with 
him, who is but a child of yesterday?".They attribute these words to the elderly 
people of the Jews, who said years later, when Jesus was a grown up boy, that 
they could not have any useful dialogue with a mere kid. But the person who 
keeps the whole context in view, will realize that this interpretation is absurd 
and has been given merely to avoid the miracle. As a matter of fact, the 
dialogue took place when the people were condemning Mary who being unmarried, 
had brought forth a child, and not when the child had grown up into manhood. V. 
46 of AI-i-`Imran (III) and v. 110 of Al-Ma'idah (V) also support the view that 
Prophet Jesus had uttered these words as a baby in the cradle and not when grown 
up. In the first verse, the angel while giving the good news of a son to Mary, 
says: "He will speak to the people alike when in the cradle and when grown up"; 
in the other verse, Allah Himself says to Prophet Jesus: ".......you talked to 
the people even in the cradle as you talked when you were grown up."<br><br>
20aThe words used are: "......dutiful to my mother", and not."dutiful to my 
parents" . This is another proof of the fact that Jesus had no father, and for 
the same reason he has been called `Jesus son of Mary' everywhere in the Qur'an.<br>
<br>21This speech in the cradle by Jesus was the `Sign' to which the angel 
referred in v. 21. As Allah intended to punish the children of Israel for their 
continuous wicked ways and evil deeds, He made a pious virgin girl of the family 
of Prophet Aaron, who had devoted herself to worship in the Temple under the 
patronage of Zachariah, bear a child and bring it before her people in order to 
concentrate the whole attention of the thousands of people assembled there on 
this extraordinary event. Then He made this new born child speak out even in the 
cradle that he had been appointed a Prophet. Though they had seen this wonderful 
Sign of Allah, they rejected the Prophethood of Jesus and brought him to the 
court for crucifixion, and thus incurred the wrath of Allah. (For further 
details, please see Al-i-Imran (III): E.N.'s 44 and 53, and An-Nina (IV): E.N.'s 
212,213).<br><br>22In vv.1-35, it has been shown that the "Doctrine of the son 
of God" in regard to Prophet Jesus is absolutely wrong. For just as the 
miraculous birth of Prophet John did not make him the `son of God', so the 
miraculous birth of Prophet Jesus could not make him the son of God. For the 
births of both were the result of the same sort of miracle as they have been 
mentioned together in the same context in the Gospel of Luke. Therefore, it is 
mere distortion that the Christians should regard one as the servant of God and 
the other as the son of God.<br><br>23This declaration by Jesus has been cited 
to tell the Christians that Jesus also taught the same Doctrine of Tauhid as was 
taught by all other Prophets. And it was they who had invented the doctrine of 
shirk by making him the son of God. (Please also refer to Al-i-`Imran (III): 
E.N. 68, and Al-Ma'idah (V): E.N.'s 100, 101 and 130).<br><br>24That is, the 
sects of the Christians.<br><br>25Here the address which was meant to be 
delivered before King Negus and his courtiers comes to an end. In the 
Introduction to this Surah, we have already stated the historical background of 
this address. In order to form an idea of its great significance, it should be 
kept in mind that:<br><br>(a) this address was sent down at the time when the 
persecuted Muslims of Makkah were going to migrate to a Christian kingdom so 
that they may present before the Christians the true Islamic creed about Prophet 
Jesus. This shows that the Muslims under no circumstances should conceal the 
Truth;<br><br>(b) it shows a most wonderful moral courage of the Muslim Migrants 
to Habash that they recited this address in the royal court at the critical 
moment, when the courtiers who had been bribed were bent on handing them over to 
their enemies. They indeed were faced with the real threat that this frank 
Islamic criticism of the basic articles of the Christian Faith might turn the 
king against them and he might hand them over to the Quraish. But in spite of 
this, they presented the whole truth before the king without the least 
hesitation.<br><br>26From here the address is directed towards the people of 
Makkah, who had forced their own near and dear relatives to emigrate from their 
homes, just as Prophet Abraham had been exiled by his own father and brethren. 
The story of Prophet Abraham has been selected for this purpose because the 
Quraish professed to accept him as their religious leader and were proud of 
being his descendants.<br><br>27It should be noted that the literal translation 
of the Arabic text is: "Do not worship Satan", though Abraham's father and the 
other people did not worship Satan in the same sense as they worshiped idols. 
But as they followed and obeyed Satan, he accused them of worshiping Satan. Thus 
it is clear that if somebody follows and obeys , Satan, he virtually worships 
him. For Satan has never been a deity in the sense that people have made him an 
object of worship; nay, they have always been cursing him and following him at 
the same time. (For further details see Surah Al-Kahf (XVIII) E.N.'s 49-50).<br>
<br>27aFor explanation, please see Surah At-Taubah (IX): E.N. 112.<br><br>28This 
is to give comfort to the Migrants who had been forced to migrate from their 
homes. They were told that they would be honored and blessed with true renown 
just as Prophet Abraham had been blessed with true renown after his Migration.<br>
<br>29The word used is mukhlas, which means "purified". In other words, Allah 
had specially chosen Prophet Moses for the Mission of Prophethood.<br><br>
30"Rasul" literally means `the one who is sent'; therefore it is used for an 
ambassador, envoy, messenger and representative. The Qur'an has used this title 
for angels, who are sent by Allah on a special mission, or for the human beings 
who brought His Message to mankind.<br><br>As regards the word "Nabi", it 
literally means the one who brings news, or the one who is high in rank, or the 
one who shows the way. This title is used for the Prophets in all the three 
senses. Thus Moses was a Messenger Prophet because he was a Messenger of high 
rank who gave news from Allah and showed the Right Way to the people.<br><br>The 
Qur'an does not necessarily differentiate between the use of the two titles, for 
sometimes it uses the title Rasul for one person at one place and the title Nabi 
for the same person at another place, and sometimes uses both the titles 
together for one and the same person. However, at some places each title has 
been used in a way as to show that there is some technical distinction between 
the two, though that has not been precisely marked out, except that every Rasul 
(Messenger) is a Nabi (Prophet) as well, but every Nabi may not be a Rasul, and 
that a Rasul has a special and more important mission to perform. This is 
supported by a Tradition of the Holy Prophet, which has been reported by Imam 
Ahmad from Abu Umamah and by Hakim from Hadrat Abu Zarr. When the Holy Prophet 
was asked how many "Messengers" and "Prophets" had been sent to the world, he 
said that the number of the Messengers was 313 or 315 and of the Prophets 
124,000<br><br>31"The right side of Tur" means the eastern side of the mountain. 
As Prophet Moses, on his way from Midian to Egypt, was passing from the southern 
side of Mt. Tur, the eastern side would lie on his right and the western on his 
left if he faced the mountain, otherwise a mountain by itself cannot have a 
right or a left side.<br><br>32See E.N. 206 of Surah An-Nisa (IV)<br><br>33There 
is a difference of opinion as to who Prophet Idris was. Some commentators opine 
that he was a Prophet from among the Israelites, but the majority of them are 
inclined to the view that he was a Prophet before Noah. There is no authentic 
Tradition which may help determine his identity. The next verse (58), however, 
supports the view that he appeared before Prophet Noah. For of all the Prophets 
mentioned, he alone was the one who may be said to be "from the descendants of 
Adam."<br><br>The commentators are of the opinion that Idris was Enoch of the 
Old Testament, about whom it is said:<br><br>"And Enoch lived sixty and five 
years, and begat Methuselah: And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 
three hundred years.... and he was not; for God took him." (Gen. 5: 21-24)<br>
<br>In Talmud, there are greater details about Enoch, which are briefly as 
follows: "Before Noah when the descendants of Adam began to degenerate, the 
angel of God called to Enoch, who led a pious life away from the people, and 
said, 'O Enoch, arise, come out from seclusion, and go about among the people of 
the earth, guiding them to the path which they should follow and the ways which 
they should adopt.'<br><br>"Receiving this Divine Command, Enoch left his 
seclusion and gathered the people together and preached to them what he had been 
commanded, with the result that they listened to him and adopted the worship of 
God. Enoch ruled over mankind for 353 years: his rule was based on justice and 
truth, and consequently God favored mankind with all kinds of blessings." (H. 
Polano: The Talmud Selections, pp. 18-21) <br><br>34The plain meaning is that 
God had favored Idris with a high rank, but according to the Israelite 
traditions, God took up Idris (Enoch) to heavens. The Bible says: "...and he was 
not; for God took him", but the Talmud has a long story to tell, which ends with 
the words: "Enoch ascended to heaven in a whirlwind, with chariot and horses of 
fire."<br><br>35It appears that the degenerate people totally discarded Salat, 
or they had become neglectful and careless in its observance. This is the first 
evil that is committed by a degenerate people; for, after this there remains no 
connection whatever between them and God. Here it has been stated as a universal 
principle that the degeneration of the people of all the former Prophets started 
with the abandonment of Salat by them.<br><br>36This was the inevitable result 
of the loss of the connection with Allah. As they became more and more 
neglectful of their Salat, their lusts took complete hold of them and they fell 
to the lowest depths of moral depravity and began to follow their whims instead 
of the Divine Commands.<br><br>37That is, the promised Gardens which are yet 
unseen by His servants.<br><br>38The word used is salam, which means ' free from 
defect and fault' . It implies to mean that the greatest blessing that man will 
enjoy in Paradise will be that there he will hear no idle, vile or indecent 
talk; all the dwellers of Paradise will be neat and clean and pure people and 
every individual will be gentle and right-minded by nature; everybody will be 
secure against backbiting, slander and indecent songs and other ugly sounds. 
Whatever men will hear will be good, sensible and right.<br><br>This is indeed a 
great blessing which only that person can fully appreciate, who possesses a neat 
and fine taste, because only such a one can feel the misery of living among a 
dirty society, where his ears are never immune against lies, backbiting, 
slander, and mischievous and sensual talk.<br><br>39This paragraph is a 
parenthesis, which has been inserted at the end of one theme and before the 
commencement of the other. It is obvious from this that this Surah was sent down 
after a long delay. At that time the Holy Prophet and his Companions were 
passing through very hard times and were always expecting a Revelation to guide 
and comfort them. When Gabriel (peace be upon him) came with the angels with 
this Revelation, he at first delivered that part of the Message which was 
immediately needed. Then before proceeding further, he said these words by the 
leave of Allah as an explanation for the delay and to give them comfort from 
Allah and counsel of fortitude. This interpretation is not only borne out by the 
wording of the passage but also by some Traditions of the Holy Prophet, which 
have been cited by Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir, and the author of Ruh ulMa `ani in 
their commentary on this passage.<br><br>40That is, You should not only follow 
strictly the Way of service and face all the obstacles and afflictions with 
patience, but also should not get uneasy, if there is a delay in Revelation and 
help. You should rest content with His service as an obedient servant and 
perform persistently the duties and responsibilities entrusted to you as a 
Servant and Messenger.<br><br>41The word Sami literally means a name sake. Here 
it implies: "Allah is the only Deity: do you know of any other deity besides 
Him? If there is none, and you know that there is none, then you do not have any 
alternative but to serve Him and obey His Commands."<br><br>42The "Satans" are 
the leaders who persuade the wicked people to enjoy themselves in this worldly 
life, for there is no life in the Hereafter, where they shall have to present 
themselves before Allah and give an account of their deeds.<br><br>43The leader 
of every rebel band.<br><br>44According to some traditions, "to be presented 
before the confines of Hell" means `to enter Hell', but none of these traditions 
is authentic. Then this interpretation goes against the Qur'an and a great many 
authentic Traditions, which clearly state that the true Believers will never be 
cast into Hell. Lexically also, vurud (being presented unto) is not synonymous 
with dukhul (causing to enter). Therefore, the correct meaning would be that 
every human being will be presented before Hell, but then, as the next verse 
clarifies, the pious people will be rescued and the transgressors left therein 
on their knees. <br><br>45In response to the recital of clear Revelations, 
instead of accepting their Message, the unbelievers put such questions as these 
to the Believers to show that they were in the right: Who has grander houses to 
live in? Who has a higher standard of life? Who enjoys splendid meetings? If we 
are enjoying all these things while you are deprived of them, you may decide for 
yourselves whether we, who are enjoying happy worldly lives, are in the wrong, 
or you who are living miserable lives of indigence are in the right? (Also see 
Surah Al-Kahf (XVIII): E.N.'s 37-38). <br><br>46That is, "On every critical 
occasion, Allah guides them to make right decisions and helps them to adopt the 
right way, and protects them from evil and wrong things; thus they go on making 
more and more progress on the right way."<br><br>47The boastful person was not a 
particular man but a typical chief of the disbelievers of Makkah. Everyone of 
them claimed, "Howsoever you may call the an erroneous and un-righteous person 
and threaten me with the Divine scourge, the tact is that I am more prosperous 
than you today and shall continue being blessed with favors in future as well. 
lust have a look at my riches, at my grandeur and at my estate, and at my 
well-known sons, and then say where you see any signs of the wrath of God.<br>
<br>48That is, the boastful words of his shall also be included in the record of 
his crimes and he shall have to bear the consequences of his arrogant claim.<br>
<br>49The Arabic word 'Izzan (from 'Izat) implies a powerful and strong person 
whom nobody may dare do any harm; here it means a person's having such a strong 
supporter that no enemy or opponent of his may even cherish an evil intention 
against him.<br><br>50That is, they will say, "We never asked them to worship us 
nor were we aware that these foolish people were worshiping us."<br><br>51That 
is: "Endure their persecutions patiently a little more, for the time of their 
punishment is coming near, for We have given them respite for a fixed term, and 
let that term expire."<br><br>52This implies two things: (1) Intercession will 
be allowed only for the one who might have received permission for it from the 
Merciful, that is, the one who believed in Allah in the world and made himself 
deserving of His pardon. (2) Only that one will be able to plead intercession 
who might have got permission for this from the Merciful, and not those ones 
whom people themselves had made their intercessors without any reason.<br><br>
53This is to comfort the righteous people who were being persecuted and insulted 
in the streets of Makkah. They are being assured that the time is coming near 
when the people will honor and love them because of their righteous deeds and 
good conduct. Hearts will be attracted towards them and the world will hold them 
in high esteem. And this will happen according to a universal principle. Those 
who are wicked, proud and haughty and try to rule over the people with falsehood 
and hypocrisy can never captivate the hearts of the people; on the other hand, 
those who invite the people to the right way with truth, honesty, sincerity and 
good conduct succeed in winning their hearts in the end, even though at first 
they might have to face the indifference and opposition of the dishonest people.</p>
