                        <p>By Abul A'la Maududi</p>
<p>The Surah takes its name from the word al-waqi`ah of the very first verse.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Revelation</strong><br>According to the chronological 
order that Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas has given of the Surahs, first Surah Ta Ha 
was sent down, then Al-Waqi'ah and then Ash-Shu`ara'(Suyuti: Al-Itqan). The same 
sequence has been reported from Ikrimah (Baihaqi: Dala'il an Nubuwwat).<br><br>
This is supported also by the story that Ibn Hisham has related from Ibn Ishaq 
about the affirmation of the Faith by Hadrat Umar (may Allah be pleased with 
him). It says that when Hadarat Umar entered his sister's house, Surah Ta Ha was 
being recited. Hearing his voice the people of the house hid the pages of the 
Qur'an. Hadrat Umar first seized his brother-in-law and then his sister rose in 
defense of her husband, he hit her also and wounded her on the head. When Umar 
saw blood on his sister, he was sorry for what he had done, and said to her: 
"Show me the manuscript that you have concealed so that I may see what it 
contains." The sister said: "You are unclean because of your polytheism: wa 
anna-hu la yamassu-ha ill-at-tahir: "Only a clean person can touch it." So, 
Hadrat Umar rose and washed himself, and then took up the manuscript to read it. 
This shows that Sarah Al-Waqi'ah had been sent down by that time for it contains 
the verse: La yamassu hu ill al mutahharun; and it had been established 
historically that Hadrat Umar embraced Islam after the first migration to Habash, 
in the fifth year of the Prophethood.<br>Theme and Subject Matter<br><br>Its 
theme is the Hereafter, Tauhid and refutation of the Makkan disbelievers' 
suspicions about the Qur'an. What they regarded as utterly incredible was that 
Resurrection would ever take place, then the entire system of the earth and 
heavens would be upset, and when all the dead would be resurrected and called to 
account, after which the righteous would be admitted to Paradise and the wicked 
cast into Hell. They regarded all this as imaginary, which could not possibly 
happen in actual fact. In answer to this, it was said: "When the inevitable 
event will take place, there will be none to belie its happening, nor will 
anyone have the Power to avert it, nor prove it to, be an unreal happening. At 
that time all peoples will be divided into three classes: (1) The foremost in 
rank and position; (2) the common righteous people and (3) those who denied the 
Hereafter and persisted in disbelief and polytheism and major sins till the 
last." How these three classes of the people will be rewarded and punished has 
been described in detail in vv. 7-56.<br><br>Then, in vv. 57-74 arguments have 
been given, one after the other, to prove the truth of the two basic doctrines 
of Islam, which the disbelievers were refusing to accept, viz. the doctrines of 
Tauhid and the Hereafter. In these arguments, apart from every thing else that 
exists in the earth and heavens, man's attention has been drawn to his own body 
and to the food that he eats and to the water that he drinks and to the fire on 
which he cooks his food, and he has been invited to ponder the question : What 
right do you have to behave independently of, or serve any other than, the God 
Whose creative power has brought you into being, and Whose provisions sustain 
you And how can you entertain the idea that after having once brought you into 
existence He has become so helpless and powerless that He cannot recreate you 
once again even if he wills to?<br><br>Then, in vv. 75-82 their suspicions in 
respect of the Qur'an have been refuted and they have been made to realize how 
unfortunate they are that instead of deriving any benefit from the great blessing 
that the Qur'an is, they are treating it with scant attention and have set only 
this share of theirs in it that they deny it. If one seriously considers this 
matchless argument that has been presented in two brief sentences about the 
truth of the Qur'an, one will find in it the same kind of firm and stable system 
as exists among the stars and planets of the Universe, and the same is the proof 
of the fact that its Author is the same Being Who has created the Universe. Then 
the disbelievers have been told that this Book is inscribed in that Writ of 
Destiny which is beyond the reach of the creatures, as if to say "You think it 
is brought down by the devils to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
him), whereas none but the pure angels has any access to the means by which it 
reaches Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from the well 
guarded Tablet."<br><br>In conclusion, man has been warned, as if to say: "You 
may brad and boast as you like and may shut your eyes to the truths in your 
arrogance of independence, but death is enough to open your eyes. At death you 
become helpless: you cannot save your own parents; you cannot save your 
children; you cannot save your religious guided and beloved leaders. They all 
die in front of your vary eyes while you look on helplessly. If there is no 
supreme power ruling over you, and your this assumption is correct that you are 
all in all in the world, and there is no God, then why don't you restore to the 
dying person his soul?Just as you are helpless in this, so it is also beyond 
your power to stop Allah from calling the people to account and mete out rewards 
and punishments to them. You may or may not believe it, but every dying person 
will surely see his own end after death. If he belongs to those nearest to God, 
he will see the good end meant for them if he be from among the righteous, he 
will see the end prepared for the righteous; and if he be from among the deniers 
of the truth, he will see the end destined for the criminals. <br></p>


<hr>
<p>Opening the discourse with this sentence by itself signifies that this is an 
answer to the objections that were than being raised in the disbelievers 
conferences against Resurrection. This was the time when the people of Makkah 
had just begun to hear the invitation to Islam from the Holy Prophet Muhammad 
(upon be Allah's peace and blessing). In it what seemed most astonishing and 
remote from reason to them was that the entire system of the earth and heavens 
would one day be overturned and then another world would be set up in which all 
the dead, of the former and the latter generations, would be resurrected. 
Bewildered they would ask: `This is just impossible ! Where will this earth, 
these oceans, these mountains, this moon and sun go? How will the centuries-old 
dead bodies rise up to life ? How can one in his senses believe that there will 
be another life after death and there will be gardens of Paradise and the fire 
of Hell ?" Such were the misgivings that were being expressed at that time 
everywhere in Makkah. It was against this background that it was said: "When the 
inevitable event happens, there shall be no one to belie it. "<br><br>In this 
verse the word "wagi ah " (event) has been used for Resurrection, which nearly 
means the same thing as the English word 'inevitable', signifying thereby that 
it is something that must come to pass. Then, its happening has been described 
by the word "waqi ah, " which is used for the sudden occurrence of a disaster. 
Laisa li-waq'at-i-ha kadhibat-un can have two meanings:<br><br>(1) That it will 
not be possible that its occurrence be averted, or stopped, or turned back; or, 
in other words, there will be no power to make it appear as an unreal event; and<br>
<br>(2) that there will be no living being to tell the lie that the event has 
not taken place. <br><br>2Literally: "that which causes (something or somebody j 
to rise and to Fall. " Its one meaning can be that it will upset every order: it 
will turn things up-side-down. Another meaning also can be that it will exalt 
the lowly and bring low the high and mighty; that is, on its advent the decision 
as to who is noble and who is ignoble among the people will be made on quite a 
different basis. Those who posed as honorable people in the world, would become 
contemptible and those who were considered contemptible would become honorable.
<br><br>3That is, it will not be a local earthquake that may occur in a 
restricted area, but it will shake the whole earth to its depths all of a 
sudden, and it will experience a tremendous jolt and tremors all through. <br>
<br>4Although the address apparently is directed to the people to whom this 
discourse was being recited, or who may read it or hear it read now, in fact the 
entire mankind is its addressee. All human beings who have been born since the 
first day of creation and will be born till the Day of Resurrection, will 
ultimately he divided into three classes.<br><br>5The word maintanah in ashab 
al-maimanah, in the original, stay have been derived from Yamin, which means the 
right hand, and also from yumn, which means good omen. If it is taken to be 
derived from yamin, ashab almaimanah would mean: `those of the right hand." 
This, however, does not imply its lexical meaning, but it signifies the people 
of exalted rank and position. The Arabs regarded the right hand as a symbol of 
strength and eminence and honor, and therefore would seat a person whom they 
wished to do honor, on the right hand, in the assemblies. And if it is taken as 
derived from yumn, ashab almaimanah would mean fortunate and blessed people. <br>
<br>6The word mash 'amah in ashab al-mash'amah, in the original, is from shu'm 
which means misfortune, ill-luck and bad omen; in Arabic the left hand also is 
called shuma. The Arabs regarded shimal (the left hand) and shu'm (bad omen) as 
synonyms, the left hand being a symbol of weakness and indignity. If a bird flew 
left on the commencement of a journey, they would take it as a bad omen; if they 
made a person sit on their left, it meant they regarded him as a weak man. 
Therefore, ashab al-mash'amah implies ill-omened people, or those who would 
suffer disgrace and ignominy, and would be made to stand on the left side in the 
Court of Allah.<br><br>7Sabiqin (the Foremost) implies the people who excelled 
others in virtue and love of the truth and in good works and responded to the 
call of Allah and His Messenger before others. They were also in the forefront 
in their response to the call for Jihad, for expending their wealth for the sake 
of the needy and for public services, or for inviting others to virtue and 
truth, in short, for spreading the good and wiping out evil and making 
sacrifices and exerting themselves whenever there was need for it. On this very 
basis, in the Hereafter too, they will be placed in the forefront.<br><br>Thus, 
mankind, so to say, will be ranged in Allah's Court like this: On the right 
hand, there will be the righteous, on the left the wicked, and in the forefront 
(nearest in Divine Presence) the Sabiqin (the Foremost in Faith and good deeds). 
According to a Hadith reported by ,Hadrat `A'ishah the Holy Prophet (upon whom 
be Allah's peace) asked the people: "Do you know who, on the Day of 
Resurrection, will he the first to be accommodated under the Divine Shade ?" The 
people said Allah and His Messenger only had the best knowledge. Thereupon the 
Holy Prophet replied: "Those who were such that when the Truth was presented 
before them, they accepted it forthwith; when a right was asked of them, they 
discharged it gracefully; and their decision in respect of others was the same 
as in respect of their own selves." (Musnad Ahmad).<br><br>8The commentators 
have differed as to who are implied by the former And the latter people '`<br>
<br>One group of them has expressed the view that the "former people" were the 
communities that passed away since the time of the Prophet Adam (peace be upon 
him) till the time of the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and 
blessings), and the ¦people of the latter day" those who will have lived in the 
world since the advent of the Holy Prophet till the Day of Resurrection. 
Accordingly the verse would mean: "The number of the Sabqin (the Foremost in 
Faith and good deeds) among the people who passed away during the thousands of 
years before the advent of the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and 
blessings) would be greater, and the number of those who would attain to the 
rank of the Sabiqin among those people who have been born since the advent of 
the Holy Prophet, or will be born till the Day of Resurrection, will be less. "<br>
<br>The second group says that the former and the latter in this verse imply the 
former and the latter people of the Holy Prophet's own Ummah itself. That is, in 
his Ummah the people belonging to the earliest period were the former among whom 
the number of the Sabiqin will be greater, and the people of the later periods 
are the latter among whom the number of the Sabiqin will be smaller.<br><br>The 
third group holds the view that this- implies the former and the latter people 
of every Prophet's own Ummah. That is, there will be numerous Sabiqin among the 
earliest followers of every Prophet, but among his later followers their number 
will decrease. The words of the verse bear all the three meanings, and possibly 
all three ate implied, for there is no contradiction between them. Besides, they 
give another meaning also and that too is cornet: every early period of a 
Prophet's following the proportion of the Sabiqin in human population would be 
greater and in the later period less, for the number of the workers of good and 
right does not increase at the rate of increase of the human populations. They 
may be more numerous as against the Sabiqin of the earliest period. but on the 
whole their number as against the world population goes on becoming less and 
less.<br><br>9This implies boys who will ever remain boys and stay young. Hadrat 
'AIi and Hadrat Hasan Basri say that these will be those children of the people, 
who died before reaching their maturity; therefore, they will neither have any 
good works to their credit for which they may be rewarded, nor any evil deeds 
for which they may be punished, But obviously, this could imply those people who 
would not deserve Paradise. For, as for the true believers, about them Allah has 
guaranteed in the Qur'an that their children will be joined with them in 
Paradise (At-Tur: 21). This is also supported by the Hadith, which Abu Da'ud 
Tayalisi, Tabarani and Bazzar have related on the authority of Hadrat Anas and 
Hadrat Samurah bin Jundub, according to which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be 
Allah's peace) said that the children of the polytheists will be attendants of 
the people of Paradise. (For further explanation, see E.N. 26 of As-Saaffat, 
E.N. 19 of At-tur). <br><br>10For explanation, see E. N . 27 of As-Saaffat, E. N 
. 22 of Surah Muhammad, E. N. 18 of At-Tur.<br><br>11For explanation, see E.N. 
17 of Surah At-tur. <br><br>12For explanation, see E.N.'s 28, 29 of As-Saaffat, 
E.N. 42, of AdDukhan, E. N . 61 of Ar-Rahman. <br><br>13This is one of the major 
blessings of Paradise, which has been mentioned at several places in the Qur'an, 
viz. that in Paradise human ears will remain secure against idle and frivolous 
talk, lying, backbiting slander, invective, boasting and bragging, taunts and 
mockery, satire and sarcasm. It will not be a society of foul-mouthed, indecent 
people who will throw mud at each other, but a society of noble and civilized 
people free of such frivolities. A person who has been blessed with some decency 
of manner and sense by Allah can very well feel what an agony it is in worldly 
life a hope of deliverance from which has been given to man in Paradise. <br>
<br>14Some commentators and translators have taken the words, illa gilan 
salam-an salama, to mean that in Paradise one will hear only the greeting of 
'Peace, peace' on every side; the correct view, however, is that it implies 
healthy and wholesome speech, i.e. such speech as may be free of the vices and 
blemishes, faults and evils, that have been mentioned in the preceding sentence. 
Here the word salam has been used nearly in the same sense as the English word 
sane.<br><br>15That is, lote-trees without thorns on them. This will be a 
superior kind of the lote-tree to be only found in Paradise, and its fruit 
likewise will be much superior to that found in the world. <br><br>16The word !a 
maqtu ah of the Text means: This fruit will neither be seasonal that its supply 
may fail when the season is over, nor its production will cease as it happens in 
a garden after its fruits has been picked. But in Paradise every kind of fruit 
will remain available in abundance in every season and will continue to be 
produced and supplied no matter how much of it is consumed. And la mamnu'ah 
means that there will be no prohibition or hindrance in obtaining fruit as it is 
in the gardens of the world, nor will it be out of reach because of thorns or 
height.<br><br>17This signifies the virtuous women of the world, who will enter 
Paradise on the basis of their faith and good works. Allah will make them young 
no matter how aged they might have died in the world; will make them beautiful 
whether or not they were beautiful in the world; and will make them virgins 
whether they died virgins in the world or after bearing children. If their 
husbands also entered Paradise with them, they would be joined with them, 
otherwise Allah will wed them to another dweller in Paradise. This very 
explanation of this verse has been reported from the Holy Prophet (upon whom be 
peace) in several Ahadith. According to Shama il Tirmidhi, an old woman 
requested the Holy Prophet to pray for her admission to Paradise. The Holy 
Prophet replied: "No old woman will enter Paradise." Hearing this the woman went 
back crying. Thereupon the Holy Prophet said to the people: "Tell her that she 
will not enter Paradise as an old woman, for Allah says: `We shall create them 
anew and make them virgins'." Ibn Abi Hatim has related, on the authority of 
Hadrat Salamah bin Yazid, that he heard the Holy Prophet ( upon whom be peace) 
explain this verse, thus: "This implies the women of the world; whether they 
died virgins or married." Tabarani contains a lengthy tradition related from 
Hadrat Umm Salamah according to which she asked the Holy Prophet the meaning of 
the several references in the Qur'an to the women of Paradise. In answer, he 
explained this very verse and said: "These are the women who died as aged and 
decayed women, with sticky eyes and gray hair; alter this old age Allah will 
again make them young and virgins." Hadrat Umm Salamah asked: "If a woman had 
several husbands in the world, one after the other, to whom will she belong in 
Paradise ?'' The Holy Prophet replied "She will he asked to make her own choice, 
and she will choose the one who had the best moral character. She will say: O my 
Lord, make me his wife, for he was the best in his conduct and dealings with me. 
O Umm Salamah, good moral conduct has carried off all the good of this world and 
the Hereafter." (For further explanation, see E.N. 51 of Surah Ar-Rahman).<br>
<br>18The word 'uruban is used for the best feminine qualities of the woman in 
Arabic. This signifies a woman who is graceful and elegant, well-mannered and 
eloquent, and brimful of feminine feelings, who loves her husband with all her 
heart, and whose husband also loves her with all his heart. <br><br>19This can 
have two meanings:<br><br>(1) That they will be of equal age with their 
husbands; and<br><br>(2) that they will be of equal age among themselves; i.e. 
all the women in Paradise will be of the same age and will eternally stay young.<br>
<br>Both these meanings may be correct at one and the same time, i.e. these 
women may be of equal age among themselves and their husbands also may be made 
of equal age with them. .According to a ,Hadith, "When the dwellers of Paradise 
enter it, their bodies will be without hair, their mustaches will be just 
appearing, but will yet he beardless, they will be handsome and 
fair-complexioned, with sturdy bodies and collyrium- stained eyes; they will all 
be 33 years of age." (Musnad Ahmad: Marwiyat Abi Hurairah). Almost the same 
theme has been related in Tirmidhi by Hadrat Mu'adh bin Jabal and Hadrat Abu 
Sa`id Khudri also. <br><br>20That is, "Their prosperity had an adverse effect on 
them. Instead of being grateful to Allah Almighty, they had become deniers of 
His blessings. Lost in pleasure-seeking they had forgotten God and persisted in 
heinous sinning. "Heinous sinning" includes disbelief, polytheism and atheism as 
well as every grave sin of morality and conduct."<br><br>21For the explanation 
of zaqqum, sec E.N. 34 of As-Saaffat.<br><br>22The arguments from here to verse 
74 provide the reasoning to prove both the doctrines of `Tauhid and of Hereafter 
rationally. For it was there two basic doctrines of the Holy Prophet's teaching 
that the people of Makkah were debating and objecting to at that time. <br><br>
23That is, "Why don't you confine that We alone are your Lord and God and We 
have the power to create you once again?" <br><br>24In this brief sentence a 
very important question has been put before man. Apart from all other things in 
the world, if man only considers as to how he himself has come into being, he 
can then neither have any doubts left about the doctrine of Tauhid presented by 
the Qur'an nor about its doctrine of the Hereafter. The process of man's own 
creation starts when the male has conveyed his sperm to the womb of the female. 
But the question is: Has the sperm by itself become endowed with the capability 
of producing a child, and necessarily a human child ? Or, has it been created by 
man himself, or, by another than God? And, is it in the power of the man, or of 
the woman, or of another agency in the world, to cause conception by this sperm? 
Then, who is responsible for the gradual formation and development of the fetus 
in the mother's womb, its shaping and molding into a unique child, the provision 
in a particular proportion of different mental and physical powers and qualities 
in each child, so that it develops into a unique person, except One God? Has 
another than God any role to play in this? Is it done by the parents themselves? 
Or, by a doctor? Or, by the prophets of saints, who were themselves created in 
this very way? Or, by the sun and the moon and the stars, which arc themselves 
subject to a law? Or, by nature, which is devoid of any knowledge, wisdom, will 
and authority? Then, is it also in the power of another than God to decide 
whether the child is to be a boy or a girl? Whether it is to be beautiful or 
ugly, strong or weak, blind and deaf and a cripple or sound bodied, intelligent 
or stupid? Then, is it another than God who decides as to people of what 
caliber, good or and are to be created in a particular nation at a particular 
time, who would cause its rise or fall? If a person is not obdurate and 
stubborn, he will himself realize that no rational answer can be given to these 
questions on the basis of polytheism and atheism. Their rational answer is only 
one and it is this Man is wholly and entirely the creation of God; and when the 
truth is this, what right has this man, the creation of God, to claim freedom 
and independence as against his Creator, or serve another beside Him?<br><br>As 
it is for Tauhid, so it is with regard to the Hereafter too. Man is created from 
a germ which cannot be seen without a powerful microscope. This gene combines in 
the darkness of the mother's body with the ovum (female germ) which is like 
itself an insignificant microscopic germ. Then by their combination a tiny 
living cell comes into being, which is the starting-point of human life. This 
cell also is too small to be seen without a microscope. Allah develops this 
insignificant cell in the mother's womb for nine months or so into a living 
human, and when its development and formation becomes complete, the mother's 
body itself pushes it out to raise a storm in the world. All human beings have 
been born into the world in this very way and are witnessing day and night this 
phenomenon of the birth of human beings like themselves. After this, only a 
foolish person could assert that the God Who is creating human beings in this 
way today would not be able to create the human beings created by Himself in 
some other way tomorrow. <br><br>25That is, "Like yow birth yow death too, is 
under Our control. We decide as to who is to die in the mother's womb itself, 
who is to die soon after birth, and who is to die at a later stage. No power in 
the world can cause death to a person before the time appointed for his death by 
Us, nor can keep him alive after it even for a moment. The dying ones die in big 
hospitals even before the eyes of eminent doctors; and the doctors themselves 
also die at their appointed time. Never bas anyone been able to know the time of 
death in advance, nor has anyone been able to avert the approaching death, nor 
to find out as to how and where and by what means will a certain person die."<br>
<br>26That is, "Just as We were not powerless to create you in your present form 
and appearance, so also We are not powerless to change the method of your 
creation and bring you into being in another form and shape with another set of 
qualities and characteristics. Today the method We have adopted for your 
creation is that conception takes place by your sperm then you arc gradually 
form and developed in your mother's womb, and then you are brought out as a 
child. This method of creation also has been devised by Us. But this is not the 
only method apart from which We may not he knowing, or may not be able to adopt, 
any other method. On the Day of Resurrection We can create you in the form of 
the man of the same age at which you died. Today We have set one particular 
measure for your sight and hearing and other faculties. But this is not the only 
measure that We have for man, which We may not have the power to change. On the 
Day of Resurrection We shall change it absolutely; so much so that you will be 
able to see and hear things which you cannot see and cannot hear here. Today 
your skin and your limbs and your eyes do not possess the power of speech. But, 
it is We Who have given the tongue the power of speech; so We are not powerless 
to cause your every limb and every part of the skin of yow body to speak by Our 
command on the Day of Resurrection. Today you live up to a certain age and then 
die. Your this living and dying also is controlled by a law ordained by Us. 
Tomorrow We can make another law to control yow life under which you may never 
die. Today you can endure punishment only to a certain extent: you cannot 
survive if the punishment is increased beyond it. This rule also has been made 
by Us. Tomorrow We can make another rule for you Under which you will be able to 
suffer much severer punishments endlessly, and death would not come to you even 
if you were given the severest torment. Today you cannot imagine that an old man 
could return to youth, that he could never become ill, that a young man could 
never be old, and, that he could stay young for ever and ever. But youth here 
changes into old age according to the biological laws made by Us. Tomorrow We 
can make some other laws for your life under which every old man may become 
young as soon as he entered Paradise and stay young and healthy eternally. <br>
<br>27That is, "You already know how you were created in the first instance, how 
the sperm was transferred from the loins of the father by which you came into 
being, how you were nourished in the mother's womb, which was no less dark than 
the grave, and formed into a living human being, how an insignificant speak was 
developed and endowed with the heart and brain, eyes and ears, and hands and 
feet, and how it was blessed with the wonderful faculties of intellect and 
sense, knowledge and wisdom, workmanship and inventiveness, etc. Is this miracle 
in any way less wonderful than raising the dead back to life ? And when you are 
witnessing this wonderful miracle with your own eyes and are yourselves a living 
evidence of it in the world, why don't you then learn the lesson that the same 
God Who by His power is causing this miracle to take place day and night, can 
also cause the miracle of life after death, Resurrection and Hell and Heaven to 
take place by the same power?"<br><br>28The above question drew the people's 
attention to the truth that they have been developed and nourished by Allah 
Almighty and have come into being by His act of creation. Now this second 
question draws their attention to this important truth that the provisions which 
sustain them, are also created only by Allah for them, as if to say: "Just as in 
your own creation human effort has nothing more to do than that your father may 
cast the sperm in your mother, so in the supply of the provisions for you also 
human effort has nothing more to do than that the farmer should sow the seed in 
the soil. The land in which cultivation is done, was not made by you. The power 
of growth to the soil was not granted by you. The substances in it that become 
the means of your food are not provided by you. The seed that you sow is not 
made capable for growth by you. The capability in every seed that from it should 
sprout up the tree of the same species of whose seed it is, has not been created 
by you. The process for changing this cultivation into blooming crops that is 
working under the soil and of arranging the required kind of weather and air and 
water above it does not owe anything in any way to your planning and skill. All 
this is the manifestation of Allah's power and providence. Then, when you have 
come into being only by His act of creation and are being sustained by His 
provision, how can you then have the right to pose yourself as independent of 
Him, or save another than Him as your deity?<br><br>Although apparently this 
verse reasons out Tauhid, yet if one considers its theme a little more deeply, 
one finds in it the argument for the Hereafter, too. The seed that is sown in 
the soil is by itself dead, but when the farmer buries it under the soil, Allah 
infuses it with plant life, which puts out sprouts and blooms into spring. Thus, 
these countless bodies are rising from the dead in front of our eyes daily. Is 
this miracle in any way loss wonderful so that a person may regard the other 
wonderful miracle of the life hereafter, which is being foretold by the Qur'an, 
as impossible?<br><br>29That is, "We have not only made arrangements of 
satisfying your hunger, but also of satisfying your thirst, This water that is 
even more essential for your life than bread has been arranged by Us, not by you 
The seas in the earth have been created by Us. It is the heat of Our sun that 
causes their water to evaporate, and it is Our winds that cause the vapors to 
rise. Then it is by Our power and wisdom that the vapors collect and form into 
clouds. Then, by Our command the clouds divide in a particular proportion and 
spread over different regions of the earth so that the share of the water 
appointed for a particular region, should reach it. And in the upper atmosphere 
also We bring about the cool that causes the vapors to change back into water We 
have not only brought you into being but are also busy making all these 
arrangements for your sustenance without which you could not survive at all. 
Then, when the fact is that you have come into being by Our act of creation, arc 
eating Our provisions and drinking Our water, where from have you got the right 
that you should pose to be independent of Us and serve another beside Us?"<br>
<br>30In this sentence an important manifestation of Allah's power and wisdom 
has been pointed out. Among the wonderful properties that Allah has created in 
water one property also is that no matter what different substances are 
dissolved in water, when it changes into vapor under the effect of heat, it 
leaves behind all adulterations and evaporates only with its original and actual 
component elements. Had it not possessed this property the dissolved substances 
also would have evaporated along with the water vapors. In this case the vapors 
that arise from the oceans would have contained the sea salt, which would have 
made the soil saline and uncultivable wherever it rained. Then, neither could 
man have survived by drinking that water, nor could it help grow any vegetation. 
Now, can a man possessed of any common sense claim that this wise property in 
water has come about by itself under some blind and deaf law of nature? This 
characteristic by virtue of which sweet, pure water is distilled from saltish 
seas and falls as rain, and then serves as a source of water-supply and 
irrigation in the form of rivers, canals, springs and wells, provides a clear 
proof of the fact that the Providence has endowed water with this property 
thoughtfully and deliberately for the purpose that it may become a means of 
sustenance for His creatures. The creatures that could be sustained by salt 
water were created by Him in the sea and there they flourish and multiply. But 
the creatures that He created on the land and in the air, stood in need of sweet 
water for their sustenance and before making arrangement of the rainfall for its 
supply He created this property in water that at evaporation it should rise 
clear and free of everything dissolved in it. <br><br>31In other words, "Why do 
you commit this ingratitude in that some of you regard the rainfall as a favor 
of the gods, and some others think that the rising of the clouds from the sea 
and their raining as water is a natural cycle that is working by itself, and 
still others, while acknowledging it as a mercy and blessing of God, do not 
admit that God has any such right on them that they should bow to Him alone? How 
is it that while you derive so much benefit from this great blessing of Allah, 
in return you commit sins of disbelief and polytheism and disobedience of Him?"
<br><br>32The tree here either implies the tree that supplies wood for lighting 
a fire, or the trees of markh and 'afar, green sticks of which were struck one 
against the other to produce sparks in ancient Arabia.<br><br>33Making the fire 
"a means of remembrance" means; "The fire by virtue of its quality of being 
kindled at, all times reminds man of his forgotten lesson that without it human 
life could not be any different from animal life. Because of the fire only did 
man learn to cook food for eating instead of eating it raw like the animals, and 
then new and ever new avenues to industry and invention went on opening up 
before him. Obviously, if God had not created the means of kindling the fire and 
the substances that could be kindled, man's inventive potentialities would have 
remained dormant. But the man has forgotten that his Creator is a wise 
Sustainer, Who created him with human capabilities on the one hand, and on the 
other, created such materials on the earth by which his these capabilities could 
become active and operative. If he is not lost in Heedlessness, the fire alone 
is enough to remind him of the favors and bounties of his Creator, which he is 
so freely enjoying in the world."<br><br>34The word muqwin in the original has 
been interpreted differently by the lexicographers. Some have taken it in the 
meaning of the travelers who have halted in the desert, some in the meaning of a 
hungry man, and some take it in the meaning of all those who derive benefit from 
the fire, whether it is the benefit of cooking food or of light or of heat. <br>
<br>35That is, "Mention His blessed name and proclaim that He is free from and 
far above the defects and faults and weaknesses that the pagans and polytheists 
ascribe to Him, and which underlie every creed of disbelief and every argument 
that is presented by the deniers of the Hereafter. " <br><br>36That is, "The 
truth is not what you seem to think it is." Here, the use of the word la (nay) 
before swearing an oath by the Qur'an's being Allah's Revelation by itself shows 
that the oath has been sworn to refute certain objections that the disbelievers 
wen raising with regard to the Qur'an. <br><br>37"The positions of the stars" : 
the positions and phases and orbits of the stars and planets. The oath implies 
that just as the system of the celestial bodies is firm and stable, so also is 
this Divine Word firm and stable. The same God Who has coated that system has 
also sent down this Word. Just as there exists perfect. consistency and harmony 
among the countless stars and planets found in the countless galaxies of the 
Universe, whereas apparently they seem to be scattered, so also this Book 
presents a perfectly consistent, and systematic code of life in which detailed 
guidance has been given, on the basis of belief, about morals, modes of worship, 
civilization and culture, economic and social life, law and justice, peace and 
war, in short, about every aspect of human life, and there is nothing out of 
harmony with the other, whereas this system of thought has been expressed in 
scattered verses and discourses given on different occasions. Then, just as the 
system of the heavens set and planned by God is stable and unalterable, and does 
not ever admit of the slightest variation, so also are the truths and 
instructions given , in this Book stable and unalterable: no part of these can 
be changed or displaced in any way. <br><br>38This implies the well-guarded 
Tablet (leuh-mahfuz). For it the word Kitab maknun has been used, which means a 
writing kept hidden, i.e. a writing that is inaccessible to all. The Qur'an's 
having been inscribed in this well guarded Book means that before its being sent 
down to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) it lay inscribed in the 
Divine Writ of Destiny in which three is no possibility of any alteration or 
corruption taking place, for it is inaccessible to every kind of creation. The 
Meaning of the Qur'an.<br><br>39This is a refutation of the accusation that the 
disbelievers used to loud against the Qur'an. They regarded the Holy Prophet as 
a sorcerer and asserted that he was being inspired with the Word by the jinn and 
satans. An answer to it has been given at several places in the Qur'an, e.g. in 
Surah Ash-Shu'ara', where it has been said: "This (lucid Book) has not beer 
brought down by satans, nor does this work behoove them, nor arc they able to do 
it. They have indeed been kept out of its hearing." (vv. 210-212). The same 
theme has been expressed here, Saying: 'None but the purified can touch it." 
That is to say "Not to speak of its being brought down by the satans, or its 
being tampered within any way when it is being revealed, none but the pure 
angels can come anywhere near it when it is being revealed from the well-guarded 
Tablet (Lauh-mahfuz; : to the Prophet. " The word mutahharin has been used for 
the angels in the sense that Allah has kept them free of every kind of impure 
feeling and desire. This same commentary of this verse has been given by Anas 
bin Malik, Ibn 'Abbas, Sa'id bin Jubair, 'Ikrimah, Mujahid, Qatadah, Abul 
'Aliyah, Suddi, Dahhak and Ibn Zaid, and the same also fits in with the context. 
For the context itself shows that after refuting the false concepts of the 
Makkan disbelievers about Tauhid and the Hereafter, now their false accusations 
against the Qur'an are being answered, and by swearing an oath by the positions 
of the stars, it is being stated that the Qur'an is an exalted Book, which is 
inscribed in the well-guarded Divine Writ, in which there is no possibility of 
any interference by any creation, and it is revealed to the Prophet in such a 
safe way that none but the pure angels can touch it.<br><br>Some commentators 
have taken la in this verse in the sense of prohibition, and have interpreted 
the verse to mean: "None who is unclean should touch it. " Although some other 
commentators take la in the sense of negation and interpret the verse to mean: 
"None but the clean and pure touch this Book," they express the opinion that 
this negation is a prohibition in the same way as the Holy Prophet's saying is a 
prohibition: "A Muslim is a brother of a Muslim: he does not treat him 
unjustly." Although in it, it has been said that a Muslim does not treat the 
other Muslim unjustly, you it enjoins that a Muslim is not to treat the other 
Muslim unjustly. Likewise, although in this verse it has been state that none 
but the clean and pure angels touch this Book, yet it enjoins that unless a 
person is purified, he should not touch it.<br><br>The fact, however, is that 
this commentary does not conform to the context of the verse. Independent of the 
context, one may take this meaning from its words, but if considered in the 
context in which the verse occurs, one does not sec any ground for saying that 
"None is to touch this Book except the clean and purified people. " For the 
addressees here are the disbelievers and they arc being told, as if to say: 
`This Book has been sent down by Allah Lord of the worlds. Therefore, your 
suspicion that the satans inspire the Prophet with it, is wrong. " What could be 
the occasion here to enunciate the Shari'ah injunction that no one should touch 
it without purification? The most that one could say in this regard is that 
although this verse has not been sent down to enjoin this command, yet the 
context points out that just as only the purified (mutahharin) can touch this 
Book in the presence of Allah, so in the world also the people who at least 
believe in its being Divine Word should avoid touching it in the impure and 
unclean state.<br><br>The following are the traditions that bear upon this 
subject:<br><br>(1) Imam Malik has related in Mu' atta this tradition on the 
authority of 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr Muhammad bin 'Amr bin Hazm: "The written 
instructions that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had sent to the 
Yarnanite chiefs by the hand of 'Amr bin Hazm contained this instruction also: 
La yamass-ul Qur an a illa tahir-un. No one should touch the Qur'an except the 
pure one." This same thing has been related by Abu Da'ud from Imam Zuhri in the 
Traditions which are immediately traced to the Holy Prophet (marasil), saying 
that the writing that he had seen with Abu Bakr Muhammad bin 'Amr bin Hazm 
contained this instruction as well.<br><br>(2) The traditions from Hadrat 'Ali 
in which he says: 'Nothing prevented the Holy Prophet of Allah from reciting the 
Qur'an but the state of uncleanness due to sexual intercourse." (Abu Da'ud, 
Nasa'i, Tirmidhi).<br><br>(3) The tradition of Ibn 'Umar in which he states: 
"The Holy Messenger of Allah said: The menstruating woman and the one who is 
unclean on account of sexual intercourse should not read any portion of the 
Qur'an. " (Abu Da'ud. Tirmidhi).<br><br>(4) The tradition of Bukhari in which it 
has been said that the letter which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) sent 
to Heraclius, the Roman emperor, also contained this verse of the Qur'an: Ya ahl 
al-Kitab-i to 'alau ila kalimat-in sawaa'un bainana wa baina-kum .. .<br><br>The 
views that have been related from the Holy Prophet's Companions and their 
immediate followers are as follows:<br><br>Salman, the Persian, saw no harm in 
reading the Qur'an without the ablutions, but even according to him touching the 
Qur'an with the hand in this state was not permissible. The same also was the 
view of Hadrat Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Umar. And Hadrat 
Hasan Basri and Ibrahim Nakha'i also regarded touching the Qur'an with the hand 
without the ablutions as disapproved, (AI-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur an)). The same 
has been reported from 'Ata', Ta'us, Sha'bi and Qasim bin Muhammad also. (Ibn 
Qudamah, Al-Mughni). However, according to all of them, reading the Qur'an 
without touching it with the hand, or reciting it from memory, was permissible 
even without the ablutions.<br><br>Hadrat 'Umar, Hadrat 'Ali, Hadrat Hasan 
Basri. Hadrat Ibrahim Nakha'i and Imam Zuhri regarded reading the Qur'an in the 
state of uncleanness due to sexual intercourse and menstruation and bleeding 
after childbirth as disapproved. But Ibn 'Abbas held the view, and the same also 
was his practice, that one could recite from memory the portion of the Qur'an 
that one usually recited as one's daily practice. When Hadrat Sa'id bin 
al-Musayyab and Sa`id bin Jubair were asked about their view in this regard, 
they replied: "Is not the Qur'an preserved in the memory of such a person ? What 
then is the harm in reciting it ?" (AI-Mughni, .9l-Muhalla by Ibn Hazm).<br><br>
The following are the viewpoints of the jurists on this subject:<br><br>The 
Hanafi viewpoint has been explained by Imam `Ala-'uddin al-Kashani in his Bada I 
as-Sana i, thus "lust as it is not permissible to offer the Prayer without the 
ablutions, so also it is not permissible to touch the Qur'an without the 
ablutions, However, if the Qur'an is in a cast or a cover, it may be touched. " 
According to some jurists, the case or cover implies the binding, and according 
to others, the bag or the envelope or the wrapper in which the Qur'an is kept 
and can also be taken out. Likewise, the books of the commentary also should not 
be touched without the ablutions, nor anything else in which a Qur'anic verse 
may have been written. However, the books of Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) may be 
touched although preferably they too may not be touched without the ablutions, 
for they also contain Qur'anic verses as part of argument and reasoning. Some 
Hanafi jurists hold the opinion that only that part of the Qur'an where the Text 
may have been written should not be touched without the ablutions. As for the 
margins there is no harm in touching it, whether they are blank or contain notes 
on the Text. The .correct thing, however, is that the margins also are a part of 
the Book and touching them amounts to touching the Book. As for reading the 
Qur'an, it is permissible without the ablutions. " In Fatawa 'Alamgiri children 
have been made an exception from this rule. The Qur'an can be given in the 
children's hand for teaching purposes whether they are in the state of ablutions 
or not..<br><br>The Shafi'i viewpoint has been stated by Imam Nawawi in 
Al-Minhaj, thus, "As it is for the Prayer and the circumambulation of the 
Ka'bah, it is also forbidden to handle the Qur'an or to touch a leaf of it 
without the ablutions. Likewise, it is also forbidden w touch the binding of the 
Qur'an, and also a bag, or a bow containing the Qur'an, or a tablet on which a 
part of the Qur'an may have been written for instructional purposes. However, it 
is lawful to touch the baggage of a person containing the Qur'anic inscription. 
A child may touch the Qur'an without the ablutions, and a person without 
ablutions may turn over a leaf with a piece of wood, or something else, if he 
wants to read the Qur'an.<br><br>The Maliki position as stated in Al-Fiqh 
'alal-Madhahib al- Arbah is: They concur with the other jurists in this that the 
state of ablutions is a prerequisite for touching the Qur'an, but in the matter 
of imparting instruction in the Qur'an they make both the teacher and the taught 
an exception from the rule, and allow even a menstruating woman to touch the 
Qur'an if she is engaged in learning or teaching it. Ibn Qadamah has cited in 
Al-Mughni this saying of Imam Malik: Although reading the Qur'an in the state of 
uncleanness due to sexual intercourse is forbidden, the woman who is discharging 
the menses is permitted to read it, for she would forget her recitations if 
prohibited from reading the Qur'an for along time. The Hanbali viewpoint as 
stated by Ibn Qadamah is as follows: In the state of uncleanness due to sexual 
intercourse and menstruation and bleeding after childbirth it is not permissible 
to read the Qur'an or any complete verse of it. However, it is permissible to 
recite bismillah, al-hamdu-lillah, etc. for although these also are parts of one 
or the other verse, their recitation does not amount to recitation of the 
Qur'an. As for handling the Qur'an, it is not permissible in any case without 
the ablutions. However, one is not forbidden to touch a letter, or a book of 
Fiqh, or some other writing containing a Qur'anic verse. Likewise, one may 
handle even without the ablutions, something that contains the Qur'an. The state 
of ablutions is also no pre-requisite for .handling the books of exegesis. 
Furthermore, if a person who is not in the state of ablutions is required to 
handle the Qur'an under an immediate need, he may do so after purification with 
the dust (tayammum). " AI-Fiqh `alal-Madhahib al- `Arabah contains this ruling 
also of the Hanbali Fiqh: It is not right for the children to handle the Qur'an 
without ablutions even when receiving instruction in it, and it is the duty of 
their guardians to make them perform the ablutions before they give the Qur'an 
to them.<br><br>The Zahiri viewpoint is that reading the Qur'an and handling it 
is permissible under all conditions, whether one is without the ablutions, or 
unclean due to sexual intercourse, or even if the woman is menstruating. Ibn 
Hazm has discussed this question fully in Al-Muhalla (vol. 1, pp. 77-84) and 
given arguments for the validity of this viewpoint and has concluded that none 
of the conditions laid down by the jurists for reading the Qur'an and handling 
it, is supported by the Qur'an and the Sunnah. <br><br>40Literally, idhan (from 
which mudhinun of the Text is derived) means to treat something with contempt, 
to deny its due importance, to regard it as unworthy of serious attention, to 
hold it in light esteem. <br><br>41In his commentary of taj `aluna rizqa-kum, 
Imam Razi has expressed the view that probably the word rizq here means 
livelihood. Since the disbelieving Qaraish regarded the message of the Qur'an as 
harmful to their economic interests and feared that if it succeeded it would 
deprive them of their means of livelihood, the verse may also mean this: "You 
have made the denial of this Qur'an a question of your economic interests, and 
for you the question of the right and wrong is of no consequence; the only thing 
of real importance in your sight is the bread for the sake of which you would 
least hesitate to oppose the truth and adhere to the falsehood."<br><br>42Hadrat 
`Uqbah bin `Amir Juhni relates that when this verse was sent down the Holy 
Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) commanded that the people put it in their 
ruku`, i.e. they should recite Subhana Rabbi -yal-`Azim in ruku ' position in 
the Prayer. And when the verse Sabbih-ismi-Rabb-i- kal-A'la was Sent down, he 
enjoined that they put it in their sajdah, i.e. they should recite Subhana 
Rabb-i -yal-a na in sajdah. (Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, 
Hakim). This show that even the most minor details of the procedure enjoined by 
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) for the Prayer are derived from 
the allusions given in the Qur'an. </p>
